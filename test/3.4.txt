  p 4  [149] “O wrapped in shamelessness, with your mind forever on profit,[150] how shall any one of the Achaians readily obey you[151] either to go on a journey or to fight men strongly in battle?[152] I for my part did not come here for the sake of the Trojan[153] spearmen to fight against them, since to me they have done nothing.[154] Never yet have they driven away my cattle or my horses,[155] never in Phthia where the soil is rich and men grow great did they[156] spoil my harvest, since indeed there is much that lies between us,[157] the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea; but for your sake,[158] o great shamelessness, we followed, to do you favour,[159] you with the dog’s eyes, to win your honour and Menelaos’[160] from the Trojans. You forget all this or else you care nothing.[161] And now my prize you threaten in person to strip from me,[162] for whom I laboured much, the gift of the sons of the Achaians.[163] Never, when the Achaians sack some well-founded citadel[164] of the Trojans, do I have a prize that is equal to your prize.[165] Always the greater part of the painful fighting is the work of[166] my hands; but when the time comes to distribute the booty[167] yours is far the greater reward, and I with some small thing[168] yet dear to me go back to my ships when I am weary with fighting.[169] Now I am returning to Phthia, since it is much better[170] to go home again with my curved ships, and I am minded no longer[171] to stay here dishonoured and pile up your wealth and your luxury.”[172] Then answered him in turn the lord of men Agamemnon:[173] “Run away by all means if your heart drives you. I will not[174] entreat you to stay here for my sake. There are others with me[175] who will do me honour, and above all Zeus of the counsels.[176] To me you are the most hateful of all the kings whom the gods love.[177] Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, and wars and battles;[178] and if you are very strong indeed, that is a god’s gift.[179] Go home then with your own ships and your own companions,[180] be king over the Myrmidons. I care nothing about you.[181] I take no account of your anger. But here is my threat to you.[182] Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.[183] I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own[184] followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,[185] your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well[186] how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back[187] from likening himself to me and contending against me.”[188] So he spoke. And the anger came on Peleus’ son, and within[189] his shaggy breast the heart was divided two ways, pondering[190] whether to draw from beside his thigh the sharp sword, driving[191] away all those who stood between and kill the son of Atreus,[192] or else to check the spleen within and keep down his anger.[193] Now as he weighed in mind and spirit these two courses[194] and was drawing from its scabbard the great sword, Athene descended[195] from the sky. For Hera the goddess of the white arms sent her,[196] who loved both men equally in her heart and cared for them.[197] The goddess standing behind Peleus’ son caught him by the fair hair,[198] appearing to him only, for no man of the others saw her.[199] Achilleus in amazement turned about, and straightway[200] knew Pallas Athene and the terrible eyes shining.
