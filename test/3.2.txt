  p 2  [45] in his heart, carrying across his shoulders the bow and the hooded[46] quiver; and the shafts clashed on the shoulders of the god walking[47] angrily. He came as night comes down and knelt then[48] apart and opposite the ships and let go an arrow.[49] Terrible was the clash that rose from the bow of silver.[50] First he went after the mules and the circling hounds, then let go[51] a tearing arrow against the men themselves and struck them.[52] The corpse fires burned everywhere and did not stop burning.[53] Nine days up and down the host ranged the god’s arrows,[54] but on the tenth Achilleus called the people to assembly;[55] a thing put into his mind by the goddess of the white arms, Hera,[56] who had pity upon the Danaans when she saw them dying.[57] Now when they were all assembled in one place together,[58] Achilleus of the swift feet stood up among them and spoke forth:[59] “Son of Atreus, I believe now that straggling backwards[60] we must make our way home if we can even escape death,[61] if fighting now must crush the Achaians and the plague likewise.[62] No, come, let us ask some holy man, some prophet,[63] even an interpreter of dreams, since a dream also[64] comes from Zeus, who can tell why Phoibos Apollo is so angry,[65] if for the sake of some vow, some hecatomb he blames us,[66] if given the fragrant smoke of lambs, of he goats, somehow[67] he can be made willing to beat the bane aside from us.”[68] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up[69] Kalchas, Thestor’s son, far the best of the bird interpreters,[70] who knew all things that were, the things to come and the things past,[71] who guided into the land of Ilion the ships of the Achaians[72] through that seercraft of his own that Phoibos Apollo gave him.[73] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[74] “You have bidden me, Achilleus beloved of Zeus, to explain to[75] you this anger of Apollo the lord who strikes from afar. Then[76] I will speak; yet make me a promise and swear before me[77] readily by word and work of your hands to defend me,[78] since I believe I shall make a man angry who holds great kingship[79] over the men of Argos, and all the Achaians obey him.[80] For a king when he is angry with a man beneath him is too strong,[81] and suppose even for the day itself he swallow down his anger,[82] he still keeps bitterness that remains until its fulfilment[83] deep in his chest. Speak forth then, tell me if you will protect me.”[84] Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[85] “Speak, interpreting whatever you know, and fear nothing.[86] In the name of Apollo beloved of Zeus to whom you, Kalchas,[87] make your prayers when you interpret the gods’ will to the Danaans,[88] no man so long as I am alive above earth and see daylight[89] shall lay the weight of his hands on you beside the hollow ships,[90] not one of all the Danaans, even if you mean Agamemnon,[91] who now claims to be far the greatest of all the Achaians.”[92] At this the blameless seer took courage again and spoke forth:[93] “No, it is not for the sake of some vow or hecatomb he blames us,[94] but for the sake of his priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured[95] and would not give him back his daughter nor accept the ransom.[96] Therefore the archer sent griefs against us and will send them
