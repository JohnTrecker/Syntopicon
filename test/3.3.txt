  p 3  [97] still, nor sooner thrust back the shameful plague from the Danaans[98] until we give the glancing-eyed girl back to her father[99] without price, without ransom, and lead also a blessed hecatomb[100] to Chryse; thus we might propitiate and persuade him.”[101] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up[102] Atreus’ son the hero wide-ruling Agamemnon[103] raging, the heart within filled black to the brim with anger[104] from beneath, but his two eyes showed like fire in their blazing.[105] First of all he eyed Kalchas bitterly and spoke to him:[106] “Seer of evil: never yet have you told me a good thing.[107] Always the evil things are dear to your heart to prophesy,[108] but nothing excellent have you said nor ever accomplished.[109] Now once more you make divination to the Danaans, argue[110] forth your reason why he who strikes from afar afflicts them,[111] because I for the sake of the girl Chryseis would not take[112] the shining ransom; and indeed I wish greatly to have her[113] in my own house; since I like her better than Klytaimestra[114] my own wife, for in truth she is no way inferior,[115] neither in build nor stature nor wit, not in accomplishment.[116] Still I am willing to give her back, if such is the best way.[117] I myself desire that my people be safe, not perish.[118] Find me then some prize that shall be my own, lest I only[119] among the Argives go without, since that were unfitting;[120] you are all witnesses to this thing, that my prize goes elsewhere.”[121] Then in answer again spoke brilliant swift-footed Achilleus:[122] “Son of Atreus, most lordly, greediest for gain of all men,[123] how shall the great-hearted Achaians give you a prize now?[124] There is no great store of things lying about I know of.[125] But what we took from the cities by storm has been distributed;[126] it is unbecoming for the people to call back things once given.[127] No, for the present give the girl back to the god; we Achaians[128] thrice and four times over will repay you, if ever Zeus gives[129] into our hands the strong-walled citadel of Troy to be plundered.”[130] Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:[131] “Not that way, good fighter though you be, godlike Achilleus,[132] strive to cheat, for you will not deceive, you will not persuade me.[133] What do you want? To keep your own prize and have me sit here[134] lacking one? Are you ordering me to give this girl back?[135] Either the great-hearted Achaians shall give me a new prize[136] chosen according to my desire to atone for the girl lost,[137] or else if they will not give me one I myself shall take her,[138] your own prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus,[139] going myself in person; and he whom I visit will be bitter.[140] Still, these are things we shall deliberate again hereafter.[141] Come, now, we must haul a black ship down to the bright sea,[142] and assemble rowers enough for it, and put on board it[143] the hecatomb, and the girl herself, Chryseis of the fair cheeks,[144] and let there be one responsible man in charge of her,[145] either Aias or Idomeneus or brilliant Odysseus,[146] or you yourself, son of Peleus, most terrifying of all men,[147] to reconcile by accomplishing sacrifice the archer.”[148] Then looking darkly at him Achilleus of the swift feet spoke:
