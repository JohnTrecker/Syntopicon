Homer is the author of the Homeric poems, a hypothesis constructed to account for their existence and quality.   There were several “Lives of Homer” in antiquity. Their date is uncertain, but the Homer they present is certainly a figure of romance and conjecture. Seven cities, though not always the same seven, are recorded as claiming to be the birth-place of Homer; six centuries are proposed as containing his birth-date.   Homeric scholarship turns around the facts known about the existence of a written text of the Iliad and Odyssey. It is established that the works of Homer, “and no other poet,” were recited at the Panathenaic festivals and that there was a fixed order for these recitations. It is accordingly inferred that there was some standard Athenian text by the second half of the sixth century b.c. If there was such a text, it did not maintain itself, because the quotations from Homer made in the fourth and third centuries b.c. show the texts then current to have been widely divergent. This disagreement in the texts does not appear to have been resolved until about 150 b.c., when the Alexandrian librarian, Aristarchus of Samothrace, published editions which were afterwards regarded as authoritative. It is not known whether Aristarchus prepared his edition from many, widely differing manuscripts or whether he had recourse to an impressive single text from earlier times. The modern vulgate text is thought to be derived from that of Aristarchus.   Extrinsic evidence, then, does not reveal an Iliad or Odyssey, written poems, in anything like their present form, before 550 b.c. However, intrinsic evidence convinces scholars that such a date was a late stage in the history of “Homeric” poetry. To reconstruct that history has always been the Homeric problem. This reconstruction, when made by argument from the text of the present poems, has sometimes seemed to involve a denial of their artistic unity. Certain scholars have seen the epics as only imperfectly unified, resulting from accretion to an imagined short original or from a joining of several remembered songs. Further, the poems have been held to be neither of the same period, nor by the same author; Samuel Butler contended on this last point that the Odyssey was written by a woman.   In recent times, although the inclusion of traditional material and the probability of later interpolation are admitted, most scholars seem to believe in one Iliad, one Odyssey, undated, and in one Homer, unknown, as author of them both.  p vii  ContentsTHE ILIADbook onebook twobook threebook fourbook fivebook sixbook sevenbook eightbook ninebook tenbook elevenbook twelvebook thirteenbook fourteenbook fifteenbook sixteenbook seventeenbook eighteenbook nineteenbook twentybook twenty-onebook twenty-twobook twenty-threebook twenty-fourTHE ODYSSEYbook onebook twobook threebook fourbook fivebook sixbook sevenbook eightbook ninebook tenbook elevenbook twelvebook thirteenbook fourteenbook fifteenbook sixteenbook seventeenbook eighteenbook nineteenbook twentybook twenty-onebook twenty-twobook twenty-threebook twenty-four  p 1  The Iliadbook one[1] Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilleus[2] and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians,[3] hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls[4] of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting[5] of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished[6] since that time when first there stood in division of conflict[7] Atreus’ son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus.[8] What god was it then set them together in bitter collision?[9] Zeus’ son and Leto’s, Apollo, who in anger at the king drove[10] the foul pestilence along the host, and the people perished,[11] since Atreus’ son had dishonoured Chryses, priest of Apollo,[12] when he came beside the fast ships of the Achaians to ransom[13] back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding[14] in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo[15] who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians,[16] but above all Atreus’ two sons, the marshals of the people:[17] “Sons of Atreus and you other strong-greaved Achaians,[18] to you may the gods grant who have their homes on Olympos[19] Priam’s city to be plundered and a fair homecoming thereafter,[20] but may you give me back my own daughter and take the ransom,[21] giving honour to Zeus’ son who strikes from afar, Apollo.”[22] Then all the rest of the Achaians cried out in favour[23] that the priest be respected and the shining ransom be taken;[24] yet this pleased not the heart of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,[25] but harshly he drove him away with a strong order upon him:[26] “Never let me find you again, old sir, near our hollow[27] ships, neither lingering now nor coming again hereafter,[28] for fear your staff and the god’s ribbons help you no longer.[29] The girl I will not give back; sooner will old age come upon her[30] in my own house, in Argos, far from her own land, going[31] up and down by the loom and being in my bed as my companion.[32] So go now, do not make me angry; so you will be safer.”[33] So he spoke, and the old man in terror obeyed him[34] and went silently away beside the murmuring sea beach.[35] Over and over the old man prayed as he walked in solitude[36] to King Apollo, whom Leto of the lovely hair bore: “Hear me,[37] lord of the silver bow who set your power about Chryse[38] and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over Tenedos,[39] Smintheus, if ever it pleased your heart that I built your temple,[40] if ever it pleased you that I burned all the rich thigh pieces[41] of bulls, of goats, then bring to pass this wish I pray for:[42] let your arrows make the Danaans pay for my tears shed.”[43] So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him,[44] and strode down along the pinnacles of Olympos, angered  p 2  [45] in his heart, carrying across his shoulders the bow and the hooded[46] quiver; and the shafts clashed on the shoulders of the god walking[47] angrily. He came as night comes down and knelt then[48] apart and opposite the ships and let go an arrow.[49] Terrible was the clash that rose from the bow of silver.[50] First he went after the mules and the circling hounds, then let go[51] a tearing arrow against the men themselves and struck them.[52] The corpse fires burned everywhere and did not stop burning.[53] Nine days up and down the host ranged the god’s arrows,[54] but on the tenth Achilleus called the people to assembly;[55] a thing put into his mind by the goddess of the white arms, Hera,[56] who had pity upon the Danaans when she saw them dying.[57] Now when they were all assembled in one place together,[58] Achilleus of the swift feet stood up among them and spoke forth:[59] “Son of Atreus, I believe now that straggling backwards[60] we must make our way home if we can even escape death,[61] if fighting now must crush the Achaians and the plague likewise.[62] No, come, let us ask some holy man, some prophet,[63] even an interpreter of dreams, since a dream also[64] comes from Zeus, who can tell why Phoibos Apollo is so angry,[65] if for the sake of some vow, some hecatomb he blames us,[66] if given the fragrant smoke of lambs, of he goats, somehow[67] he can be made willing to beat the bane aside from us.”[68] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up[69] Kalchas, Thestor’s son, far the best of the bird interpreters,[70] who knew all things that were, the things to come and the things past,[71] who guided into the land of Ilion the ships of the Achaians[72] through that seercraft of his own that Phoibos Apollo gave him.[73] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[74] “You have bidden me, Achilleus beloved of Zeus, to explain to[75] you this anger of Apollo the lord who strikes from afar. Then[76] I will speak; yet make me a promise and swear before me[77] readily by word and work of your hands to defend me,[78] since I believe I shall make a man angry who holds great kingship[79] over the men of Argos, and all the Achaians obey him.[80] For a king when he is angry with a man beneath him is too strong,[81] and suppose even for the day itself he swallow down his anger,[82] he still keeps bitterness that remains until its fulfilment[83] deep in his chest. Speak forth then, tell me if you will protect me.”[84] Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[85] “Speak, interpreting whatever you know, and fear nothing.[86] In the name of Apollo beloved of Zeus to whom you, Kalchas,[87] make your prayers when you interpret the gods’ will to the Danaans,[88] no man so long as I am alive above earth and see daylight[89] shall lay the weight of his hands on you beside the hollow ships,[90] not one of all the Danaans, even if you mean Agamemnon,[91] who now claims to be far the greatest of all the Achaians.”[92] At this the blameless seer took courage again and spoke forth:[93] “No, it is not for the sake of some vow or hecatomb he blames us,[94] but for the sake of his priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured[95] and would not give him back his daughter nor accept the ransom.[96] Therefore the archer sent griefs against us and will send them  p 3  [97] still, nor sooner thrust back the shameful plague from the Danaans[98] until we give the glancing-eyed girl back to her father[99] without price, without ransom, and lead also a blessed hecatomb[100] to Chryse; thus we might propitiate and persuade him.”[101] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up[102] Atreus’ son the hero wide-ruling Agamemnon[103] raging, the heart within filled black to the brim with anger[104] from beneath, but his two eyes showed like fire in their blazing.[105] First of all he eyed Kalchas bitterly and spoke to him:[106] “Seer of evil: never yet have you told me a good thing.[107] Always the evil things are dear to your heart to prophesy,[108] but nothing excellent have you said nor ever accomplished.[109] Now once more you make divination to the Danaans, argue[110] forth your reason why he who strikes from afar afflicts them,[111] because I for the sake of the girl Chryseis would not take[112] the shining ransom; and indeed I wish greatly to have her[113] in my own house; since I like her better than Klytaimestra[114] my own wife, for in truth she is no way inferior,[115] neither in build nor stature nor wit, not in accomplishment.[116] Still I am willing to give her back, if such is the best way.[117] I myself desire that my people be safe, not perish.[118] Find me then some prize that shall be my own, lest I only[119] among the Argives go without, since that were unfitting;[120] you are all witnesses to this thing, that my prize goes elsewhere.”[121] Then in answer again spoke brilliant swift-footed Achilleus:[122] “Son of Atreus, most lordly, greediest for gain of all men,[123] how shall the great-hearted Achaians give you a prize now?[124] There is no great store of things lying about I know of.[125] But what we took from the cities by storm has been distributed;[126] it is unbecoming for the people to call back things once given.[127] No, for the present give the girl back to the god; we Achaians[128] thrice and four times over will repay you, if ever Zeus gives[129] into our hands the strong-walled citadel of Troy to be plundered.”[130] Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:[131] “Not that way, good fighter though you be, godlike Achilleus,[132] strive to cheat, for you will not deceive, you will not persuade me.[133] What do you want? To keep your own prize and have me sit here[134] lacking one? Are you ordering me to give this girl back?[135] Either the great-hearted Achaians shall give me a new prize[136] chosen according to my desire to atone for the girl lost,[137] or else if they will not give me one I myself shall take her,[138] your own prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus,[139] going myself in person; and he whom I visit will be bitter.[140] Still, these are things we shall deliberate again hereafter.[141] Come, now, we must haul a black ship down to the bright sea,[142] and assemble rowers enough for it, and put on board it[143] the hecatomb, and the girl herself, Chryseis of the fair cheeks,[144] and let there be one responsible man in charge of her,[145] either Aias or Idomeneus or brilliant Odysseus,[146] or you yourself, son of Peleus, most terrifying of all men,[147] to reconcile by accomplishing sacrifice the archer.”[148] Then looking darkly at him Achilleus of the swift feet spoke:  p 4  [149] “O wrapped in shamelessness, with your mind forever on profit,[150] how shall any one of the Achaians readily obey you[151] either to go on a journey or to fight men strongly in battle?[152] I for my part did not come here for the sake of the Trojan[153] spearmen to fight against them, since to me they have done nothing.[154] Never yet have they driven away my cattle or my horses,[155] never in Phthia where the soil is rich and men grow great did they[156] spoil my harvest, since indeed there is much that lies between us,[157] the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea; but for your sake,[158] o great shamelessness, we followed, to do you favour,[159] you with the dog’s eyes, to win your honour and Menelaos’[160] from the Trojans. You forget all this or else you care nothing.[161] And now my prize you threaten in person to strip from me,[162] for whom I laboured much, the gift of the sons of the Achaians.[163] Never, when the Achaians sack some well-founded citadel[164] of the Trojans, do I have a prize that is equal to your prize.[165] Always the greater part of the painful fighting is the work of[166] my hands; but when the time comes to distribute the booty[167] yours is far the greater reward, and I with some small thing[168] yet dear to me go back to my ships when I am weary with fighting.[169] Now I am returning to Phthia, since it is much better[170] to go home again with my curved ships, and I am minded no longer[171] to stay here dishonoured and pile up your wealth and your luxury.”[172] Then answered him in turn the lord of men Agamemnon:[173] “Run away by all means if your heart drives you. I will not[174] entreat you to stay here for my sake. There are others with me[175] who will do me honour, and above all Zeus of the counsels.[176] To me you are the most hateful of all the kings whom the gods love.[177] Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, and wars and battles;[178] and if you are very strong indeed, that is a god’s gift.[179] Go home then with your own ships and your own companions,[180] be king over the Myrmidons. I care nothing about you.[181] I take no account of your anger. But here is my threat to you.[182] Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.[183] I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own[184] followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,[185] your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well[186] how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back[187] from likening himself to me and contending against me.”[188] So he spoke. And the anger came on Peleus’ son, and within[189] his shaggy breast the heart was divided two ways, pondering[190] whether to draw from beside his thigh the sharp sword, driving[191] away all those who stood between and kill the son of Atreus,[192] or else to check the spleen within and keep down his anger.[193] Now as he weighed in mind and spirit these two courses[194] and was drawing from its scabbard the great sword, Athene descended[195] from the sky. For Hera the goddess of the white arms sent her,[196] who loved both men equally in her heart and cared for them.[197] The goddess standing behind Peleus’ son caught him by the fair hair,[198] appearing to him only, for no man of the others saw her.[199] Achilleus in amazement turned about, and straightway[200] knew Pallas Athene and the terrible eyes shining.  p 5  [201] He uttered winged words and addressed her: “Why have you come now,[202] o child of Zeus of the aegis, once more? Is it that you may see[203] the outrageousness of the son of Atreus Agamemnon?[204] Yet will I tell you this thing, and I think it shall be accomplished.[205] By such acts of arrogance he may even lose his own life.”[206] Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:[207] “I have come down to stay your anger—but will you obey me?—[208] from the sky; and the goddess of the white arms Hera sent me,[209] who loves both of you equally in her heart and cares for you.[210] Come then, do not take your sword in your hand, keep clear of fighting,[211] though indeed with words you may abuse him, and it will be that way.[212] And this also will I tell you and it will be a thing accomplished.[213] Some day three times over such shining gifts shall be given you[214] by reason of this outrage. Hold your hand then, and obey us.”[215] Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[216] “Goddess, it is necessary that I obey the word of you two,[217] angry though I am in my heart. So it will be better.[218] If any man obeys the gods, they listen to him also.”[219] He spoke, and laid his heavy hand on the silver sword hilt[220] and thrust the great blade back into the scabbard nor disobeyed[221] the word of Athene. And she went back again to Olympos[222] to the house of Zeus of the aegis with the other divinities.[223] But Peleus’ son once again in words of derision[224] spoke to Atreides, and did not yet let go of his anger:[225] “You wine sack, with a dog’s eyes, with a deer’s heart. Never[226] once have you taken courage in your heart to arm with your people[227] for battle, or go into ambuscade with the best of the Achaians.[228] No, for in such things you see death. Far better to your mind[229] is it, all along the widespread host of the Achaians[230] to take away the gifts of any man who speaks up against you.[231] King who feed on your people, since you rule nonentities;[232] otherwise, son of Atreus, this were your last outrage.[233] But I will tell you this and swear a great oath upon it:[234] in the name of this sceptre, which never again will bear leaf nor[235] branch, now that it has left behind the cut stump in the mountains,[236] nor shall it ever blossom again, since the bronze blade stripped[237] bark and leafage, and now at last the sons of the Achaians[238] carry it in their hands in state when they administer[239] the justice of Zeus. And this shall be a great oath before you:[240] some day longing for Achilleus will come to the sons of Achaians,[241] all of them. Then stricken at heart though you be, you will be able[242] to do nothing, when in their numbers before man-slaughtering Hektor[243] they drop and die. And then you will eat out the heart within you[244] in sorrow, that you did no honour to the best of the Achaians.”[245] Thus spoke Peleus’ son and dashed to the ground the sceptre[246] studded with golden nails, and sat down again. But Atreides[247] raged still on the other side, and between them Nestor[248] the fair-spoken rose up, the lucid speaker of Pylos,[249] from whose lips the streams of words ran sweeter than honey.[250] In his time two generations of mortal men had perished,[251] those who had grown up with him and they who had been born to[252] these in sacred Pylos, and he was king in the third age.  p 6  [253] He in kind intention toward both stood forth and addressed them:[254] “Oh, for shame. Great sorrow comes on the land of Achaia.[255] Now might Priam and the sons of Priam in truth be happy,[256] and all the rest of the Trojans be visited in their hearts with gladness,[257] were they to hear all this wherein you two are quarrelling,[258] you, who surpass all Danaans in council, in fighting.[259] Yet be persuaded. Both of you are younger than I am.[260] Yes, and in my time I have dealt with better men than[261] you are, and never once did they disregard me. Never[262] yet have I seen nor shall see again such men as these were,[263] men like Peirithoös, and Dryas, shepherd of the people,[264] Kaineus and Exadios, godlike Polyphemos,[265] or Theseus, Aigeus’ son, in the likeness of the immortals.[266] These were the strongest generation of earth-born mortals,[267] the strongest, and they fought against the strongest, the beast men[268] living within the mountains, and terribly they destroyed them.[269] I was of the company of these men, coming from Pylos,[270] a long way from a distant land, since they had summoned me.[271] And I fought single-handed, yet against such men no one[272] of the mortals now alive upon earth could do battle. And also[273] these listened to the counsels I gave and heeded my bidding.[274] Do you also obey, since to be persuaded is better.[275] You, great man that you are, yet do not take the girl away[276] but let her be, a prize as the sons of the Achaians gave her[277] first. Nor, son of Peleus, think to match your strength with[278] the king, since never equal with the rest is the portion of honour[279] of the sceptred king to whom Zeus gives magnificence. Even[280] though you are the stronger man, and the mother who bore you was immortal,[281] yet is this man greater who is lord over more than you rule.[282] Son of Atreus, give up your anger; even I entreat you[283] to give over your bitterness against Achilleus, he who[284] stands as a great bulwark of battle over all the Achaians.”[285] Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:[286] “Yes, old sir, all this you have said is fair and orderly.[287] Yet here is a man who wishes to be above all others,[288] who wishes to hold power over all, and to be lord of[289] all, and give them their orders, yet I think one will not obey him.[290] And if the everlasting gods have made him a spearman,[291] yet they have not given him the right to speak abusively.”[292] Then looking at him darkly brilliant Achilleus answered him:[293] “So must I be called of no account and a coward[294] if I must carry out every order you may happen to give me.[295] Tell other men to do these things, but give me no more[296] commands, since I for my part have no intention to obey you.[297] And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.[298] With my hands I will not fight for the girl’s sake, neither[299] with you nor any other man, since you take her away who gave her.[300] But of all the other things that are mine beside my fast black[301] ship, you shall take nothing away against my pleasure.[302] Come, then, only try it, that these others may see also;[303] instantly your own black blood will stain my spearpoint.”[304] So these two after battling in words of contention  p 7  [305] stood up, and broke the assembly beside the ships of the Achaians.[306] Peleus’ son went back to his balanced ships and his shelter[307] with Patroklos, Menoitios’ son, and his own companions.[308] But the son of Atreus drew a fast ship down to the water[309] and allotted into it twenty rowers and put on board it[310] the hecatomb for the god and Chryseis of the fair cheeks[311] leading her by the hand. And in charge went crafty Odysseus.[312] These then putting out went over the ways of the water[313] while Atreus’ son told his people to wash off their defilement.[314] And they washed it away and threw the washings into the salt sea.[315] Then they accomplished perfect hecatombs to Apollo,[316] of bulls and goats along the beach of the barren salt sea.[317] The savour of the burning swept in circles up to the bright sky.[318] Thus these were busy about the army. But Agamemnon[319] did not give up his anger and the first threat he made to Achilleus,[320] but to Talthybios he gave his orders and Eurybates[321] who were heralds and hard-working henchmen to him: “Go now[322] to the shelter of Peleus’ son Achilleus, to bring back[323] Briseis of the fair cheeks leading her by the hand. And if he[324] will not give her, I must come in person to take her[325] with many men behind me, and it will be the worse for him.”[326] He spoke and sent them forth with this strong order upon them.[327] They went against their will beside the beach of the barren[328] salt sea, and came to the shelters and the ships of the Myrmidons.[329] The man himself they found beside his shelter and his black ship[330] sitting. And Achilleus took no joy at all when he saw them.[331] These two terrified and in awe of the king stood waiting[332] quietly, and did not speak a word at all nor question him.[333] But he knew the whole matter in his own heart, and spoke first:[334] “Welcome, heralds, messengers of Zeus and of mortals.[335] Draw near. You are not to blame in my sight, but Agamemnon[336] who sent the two of you here for the sake of the girl Briseis.[337] Go then, illustrious Patroklos, and bring the girl forth[338] and give her to these to be taken away. Yet let them be witnesses[339] in the sight of the blessed gods, in the sight of mortal[340] men, and of this cruel king, if ever hereafter[341] there shall be need of me to beat back the shameful destruction[342] from the rest. For surely in ruinous heart he makes sacrifice[343] and has not wit enough to look behind and before him[344] that the Achaians fighting beside their ships shall not perish.”[345] So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion.[346] He led forth from the hut Briseis of the fair cheeks and gave her[347] to be taken away; and they walked back beside the ships of the Achaians,[348] and the woman all unwilling went with them still. But Achilleus[349] weeping went and sat in sorrow apart from his companions[350] beside the beach of the grey sea looking out on the infinite water.[351] Many times stretching forth his hands he called on his mother:[352] “Since, my mother, you bore me to be a man with a short life,[353] therefore Zeus of the loud thunder on Olympos should grant me[354] honour at least. But now he has given me not even a little.[355] Now the son of Atreus, powerful Agamemnon,[356] has dishonoured me, since he has taken away my prize and keeps it.”[357] So he spoke in tears and the lady his mother heard him  p 8  [358] as she sat in the depths of the sea at the side of her aged father,[359] and lightly she emerged like a mist from the grey water.[360] She came and sat beside him as he wept, and stroked him[361] with her hand and called him by name and spoke to him: “Why then,[362] child, do you lament? What sorrow has come to your heart now?[363] Tell me, do not hide it in your mind, and thus we shall both know.”[364] Sighing heavily Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:[365] “You know; since you know why must I tell you all this?[366] We went against Thebe, the sacred city of Eëtion,[367] and the city we sacked, and carried everything back to this place,[368] and the sons of the Achaians made a fair distribution[369] and for Atreus’ son they chose out Chryseis of the fair cheeks.[370] Then Chryses, priest of him who strikes from afar, Apollo,[371] came beside the fast ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians to ransom[372] back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding[373] in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo[374] who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians,[375] but above all Atreus’ two sons, the marshals of the people.[376] Then all the rest of the Achaians cried out in favour[377] that the priest be respected and the shining ransom be taken;[378] yet this pleased not the heart of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,[379] but harshly he sent him away with a strong order upon him.[380] The old man went back again in anger, but Apollo[381] listened to his prayer, since he was very dear to him, and let go[382] the wicked arrow against the Argives. And now the people[383] were dying one after another while the god’s shafts ranged[384] everywhere along the wide host of the Achaians, till the seer[385] knowing well the truth interpreted the designs of the archer.[386] It was I first of all urged then the god’s appeasement;[387] and the anger took hold of Atreus’ son, and in speed standing[388] he uttered his threat against me, and now it is a thing accomplished.[389] For the girl the glancing-eyed Achaians are taking to Chryse[390] in a fast ship, also carrying to the king presents. But even[391] now the heralds went away from my shelter leading[392] Briseus’ daughter, whom the sons of the Achaians gave me.[393] You then, if you have power to, protect your own son, going[394] to Olympos and supplicating Zeus, if ever before now[395] either by word you comforted Zeus’ heart or by action.[396] Since it is many times in my father’s halls I have heard you[397] making claims, when you said you only among the immortals[398] beat aside shameful destruction from Kronos’ son the dark-misted,[399] that time when all the other Olympians sought to bind him,[400] Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then you,[401] goddess, went and set him free from his shackles, summoning[402] in speed the creature of the hundred hands to tall Olympos,[403] that creature the gods name Briareus, but all men[404] Aigaios’ son, but he is far greater in strength than his father.[405] He rejoicing in the glory of it sat down by Kronion,[406] and the rest of the blessed gods were frightened and gave up binding him.[407] Sit beside him and take his knees and remind him of these things[408] now, if perhaps he might be willing to help the Trojans,  p 9  [409] and pin the Achaians back against the ships and the water,[410] dying, so that thus they may all have profit of their own king,[411] that Atreus’ son wide-ruling Agamemnon may recognize[412] his madness, that he did no honour to the best of the Achaians.”[413] Thetis answered him then letting the tears fall: “Ah me,[414] my child. Your birth was bitterness. Why did I raise you?[415] If only you could sit by your ships untroubled, not weeping,[416] since indeed your lifetime is to be short, of no length.[417] Now it has befallen that your life must be brief and bitter[418] beyond all men’s. To a bad destiny I bore you in my chambers.[419] But I will go to cloud-dark Olympos and ask this[420] thing of Zeus who delights in the thunder. Perhaps he will do it.[421] Do you therefore continuing to sit by your swift ships[422] be angry at the Achaians and stay away from all fighting.[423] For Zeus went to the blameless Aithiopians at the Ocean[424] yesterday to feast, and the rest of the gods went with him.[425] On the twelfth day he will be coming back to Olympos,[426] and then I will go for your sake to the house of Zeus, bronze-founded,[427] and take him by the knees and I think I can persuade him.”[428] So speaking she went away from that place and left him[429] sorrowing in his heart for the sake of the fair-girdled woman[430] whom they were taking by force against his will. But Odysseus[431] meanwhile drew near to Chryse conveying the sacred hecatomb.[432] These when they were inside the many-hollowed harbour[433] took down and gathered together the sails and stowed them in the black ship,[434] let down the mast by the forestays, and settled it into the mast crutch[435] easily, and rowed her in with oars to the mooring.[436] They threw over the anchor stones and made fast the stern cables[437] and themselves stepped out on to the break of the sea beach,[438] and led forth the hecatomb to the archer Apollo,[439] and Chryseis herself stepped forth from the sea-going vessel.[440] Odysseus of the many designs guided her to the altar[441] and left her in her father’s arms and spoke a word to him:[442] “Chryses, I was sent here by the lord of men Agamemnon[443] to lead back your daughter and accomplish a sacred hecatomb[444] to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate[445] the lord who has heaped unhappiness and tears on the Argives.”[446] He spoke, and left her in his arms. And he received gladly[447] his beloved child. And the men arranged the sacred hecatomb[448] for the god in orderly fashion around the strong-founded altar.[449] Next they washed their hands and took up the scattering barley.[450] Standing among them with lifted arms Chryses prayed in a great voice:[451] “Hear me, lord of the silver bow, who set your power about[452] Chryse and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over[453] Tenedos; if once before you listened to my prayers[454] and did me honour and smote strongly the host of the Achaians,[455] so one more time bring to pass the wish that I pray for.[456] Beat aside at last the shameful plague from the Danaans.”[457] So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him.[458] And when all had made prayer and flung down the scattering barley  p 10  [459] first they drew back the victims’ heads and slaughtered them and skinned them,[460] and cut away the meat from the thighs and wrapped them in fat,[461] making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh upon them.[462] The old man burned these on a cleft stick and poured the gleaming[463] wine over, while the young men with forks in their hands stood about him.[464] But when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals,[465] they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them[466] and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.[467] Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready[468] they feasted, nor was any man’s hunger denied a fair portion.[469] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[470] the young men filled the mixing bowls with pure wine, passing[471] a portion to all, when they had offered drink in the goblets.[472] All day long they propitiated the god with singing,[473] chanting a splendid hymn to Apollo, these young Achaians,[474] singing to the one who works from afar, who listened in gladness.[475] Afterwards when the sun went down and darkness came onward[476] they lay down and slept beside the ship’s stern cables.[477] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[478] they put forth to sea toward the wide camp of the Achaians.[479] And Apollo who works from afar sent them a favouring stern wind.[480] They set up the mast again and spread on it the white sails,[481] and the wind blew into the middle of the sail, and at the cutwater[482] a blue wave rose and sang strongly as the ship went onward.[483] She ran swiftly cutting across the swell her pathway.[484] But when they had come back to the wide camp of the Achaians[485] they hauled the black ship up on the mainland, high up[486] on the sand, and underneath her they fixed the long props.[487] Afterwards they scattered to their own ships and their shelters.[488] But that other still sat in anger beside his swift ships,[489] Peleus’ son divinely born, Achilleus of the swift feet.[490] Never now would he go to assemblies where men win glory,[491] never more into battle, but continued to waste his heart out[492] sitting there, though he longed always for the clamour and fighting.[493] But when the twelfth dawn after this day appeared, the gods who[494] live forever came back to Olympos all in a body[495] and Zeus led them; nor did Thetis forget the entreaties[496] of her son, but she emerged from the sea’s waves early[497] in the morning and went up to the tall sky and Olympos.[498] She found Kronos’ broad-browed son apart from the others[499] sitting upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos.[500] She came and sat beside him with her left hand embracing[501] his knees, but took him underneath the chin with her right hand[502] and spoke in supplication to lord Zeus son of Kronos:[503] “Father Zeus, if ever before in word or action[504] I did you favour among the immortals, now grant what I ask for.[505] Now give honour to my son short-lived beyond all other[506] mortals. Since even now the lord of men Agamemnon[507] dishonours him, who has taken away his prize and keeps it.[508] Zeus of the counsels, lord of Olympos, now do him honour.  p 11  [509] So long put strength into the Trojans, until the Achaians[510] give my son his rights, and his honour is increased among them.”[511] She spoke thus. But Zeus who gathers the clouds made no answer[512] but sat in silence a long time. And Thetis, as she had taken[513] his knees, clung fast to them and urged once more her question:[514] “Bend your head and promise me to accomplish this thing,[515] or else refuse it, you have nothing to fear, that I may know[516] by how much I am the most dishonoured of all gods.”[517] Deeply disturbed Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:[518] “This is a disastrous matter when you set me in conflict[519] with Hera, and she troubles me with recriminations.[520] Since even as things are, forever among the immortals[521] she is at me and speaks of how I help the Trojans in battle.[522] Even so, go back again now, go away, for fear she[523] see us. I will look to these things that they be accomplished.[524] See then, I will bend my head that you may believe me.[525] For this among the immortal gods is the mightiest witness[526] I can give, and nothing I do shall be vain nor revocable[527] nor a thing unfulfilled when I bend my head in assent to it.”[528] He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his head with the dark brows,[529] and the immortally anointed hair of the great god[530] swept from his divine head, and all Olympos was shaken.[531] So these two who had made their plans separated, and Thetis[532] leapt down again from shining Olympos into the sea’s depth,[533] but Zeus went back to his own house, and all the gods rose up[534] from their chairs to greet the coming of their father, not one had courage[535] to keep his place as the father advanced, but stood up to greet him.[536] Thus he took his place on the throne; yet Hera was not[537] ignorant, having seen how he had been plotting counsels[538] with Thetis the silver-footed, the daughter of the sea’s ancient,[539] and at once she spoke revilingly to Zeus son of Kronos:[540] “Treacherous one, what god has been plotting counsels with you?[541] Always it is dear to your heart in my absence to think of[542] secret things and decide upon them. Never have you patience[543] frankly to speak to me the thing that you purpose.”[544] Then to her the father of gods and men made answer:[545] “Hera, do not go on hoping that you will hear all my[546] thoughts, since these will be too hard for you, though you are my wife.[547] Any thought that it is right for you to listen to, no one[548] neither man nor any immortal shall hear it before you.[549] But anything that apart from the rest of the gods I wish to[550] plan, do not always question each detail nor probe me.”[551] Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered:[552] “Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[553] Truly too much in time past I have not questioned nor probed you,[554] but you are entirely free to think out whatever pleases you.[555] Now, though, I am terribly afraid you were won over[556] by Thetis the silver-footed, the daughter of the sea’s ancient.[557] For early in the morning she sat beside you and took your[558] knees, and I think you bowed your head in assent to do honour[559] to Achilleus, and to destroy many beside the ships of the Achaians.”  p 12  [560] Then in return Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:[561] “Dear lady, I never escape you, you are always full of suspicion.[562] Yet thus you can accomplish nothing surely, but be more[563] distant from my heart than ever, and it will be the worse for you.[564] If what you say is true, then that is the way I wish it.[565] But go then, sit down in silence, and do as I tell you,[566] for fear all the gods, as many as are on Olympos, can do nothing[567] if I come close and lay my unconquerable hands upon you.”[568] He spoke, and the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera was frightened[569] and went and sat down in silence wrenching her heart to obedience,[570] and all the Uranian gods in the house of Zeus were troubled.[571] Hephaistos the renowned smith rose up to speak among them,[572] to bring comfort to his beloved mother, Hera of the white arms:[573] “This will be a disastrous matter and not endurable[574] if you two are to quarrel thus for the sake of mortals[575] and bring brawling among the gods. There will be no pleasure[576] in the stately feast at all, since vile things will be uppermost.[577] And I entreat my mother, though she herself understands it,[578] to be ingratiating toward our father Zeus, that no longer[579] our father may scold her and break up the quiet of our feasting.[580] For if the Olympian who handles the lightning should be minded[581] to hurl us out of our places, he is far too strong for any.[582] Do you therefore approach him again with words made gentle,[583] and at once the Olympian will be gracious again to us.”[584] He spoke, and springing to his feet put a two-handled goblet[585] into his mother’s hands and spoke again to her once more:[586] “Have patience, my mother, and endure it, though you be saddened,[587] for fear that, dear as you are, I see you before my own eyes[588] struck down, and then sorry though I be I shall not be able[589] to do anything. It is too hard to fight against the Olympian.[590] There was a time once before now I was minded to help you,[591] and he caught me by the foot and threw me from the magic threshold,[592] and all day long I dropped helpless, and about sunset[593] I landed in Lemnos, and there was not much life left in me.[594] After that fall it was the Sintian men who took care of me.”[595] He spoke, and the goddess of the white arms Hera smiled at him,[596] and smiling she accepted the goblet out of her son’s hand.[597] Thereafter beginning from the left he poured drinks for the other[598] gods, dipping up from the mixing bowl the sweet nectar.[599] But among the blessed immortals uncontrollable laughter[600] went up as they saw Hephaistos bustling about the palace.[601] Thus thereafter the whole day long until the sun went under[602] they feasted, nor was anyone’s hunger denied a fair portion,[603] nor denied the beautifully wrought lyre in the hands of Apollo[604] nor the antiphonal sweet sound of the Muses singing.[605] Afterwards when the light of the flaming sun went under[606] they went away each one to sleep in his home where[607] for each one the far-renowned strong-handed Hephaistos[608] had built a house by means of his craftsmanship and cunning.[609] Zeus the Olympian and lord of the lightning went to[610] his own bed, where always he lay when sweet sleep came on him.[611] Going up to the bed he slept and Hera of the gold throne beside him.  p 13  book two[1] Now the rest of the gods, and men who were lords of chariots,[2] slept night long, but the ease of sleep came not upon Zeus[3] who was pondering in his heart how he might bring honour[4] to Achilleus, and destroy many beside the ships of the Achaians.[5] Now to his mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,[6] to send evil Dream to Atreus’ son Agamemnon.[7] He cried out to the dream and addressed him in winged words:[8] “Go forth, evil Dream, beside the swift ships of the Achaians.[9] Make your way to the shelter of Atreus’ son Agamemnon;[10] speak to him in words exactly as I command you.[11] Bid him arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle[12] in all haste; since now he might take the wide-wayed city[13] of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos[14] arguing the matter, since Hera forced them all over[15] by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans.”[16] So he spoke, and Dream listened to his word and descended.[17] Lightly he came down beside the swift ships of the Achaians[18] and came to Agamemnon the son of Atreus. He found him[19] sleeping within his shelter in a cloud of immortal slumber.[20] Dream stood then beside his head in the likeness of Nestor,[21] Neleus’ son, whom Agamemnon honoured beyond all[22] elders beside. In Nestor’s likeness the divine Dream spoke to him:[23] “Son of wise Atreus breaker of horses, are you sleeping?[24] He should not sleep night long who is a man burdened with counsels[25] and responsibility for a people and cares so numerous.[26] Listen quickly to what I say, since I am a messenger[27] of Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.[28] Zeus bids you arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle[29] in all haste; since now you might take the wide-wayed city[30] of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos[31] arguing the matter, since Hera forced them all over[32] by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans[33] from Zeus. Keep this thought in your heart then, let not forgetfulness[34] take you, after you are released from the kindly sweet slumber.”[35] So he spoke and went away, and left Agamemnon[36] there, believing things in his heart that were not to be accomplished.[37] For he thought that on that very day he would take Priam’s city;[38] fool, who knew nothing of all the things Zeus planned to accomplish,[39] Zeus, who yet was minded to visit tears and sufferings[40] on Trojans and Danaans alike in the strong encounters.[41] Agamemnon awoke from sleep, the divine voice drifting[42] around him. He sat upright and put on his tunic,[43] beautiful, fresh woven, and threw the great mantle over it.[44] Underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals[45] and across his shoulders slung the sword with the nails of silver,[46] and took up the sceptre of his fathers, immortal forever.[47] Thus he went beside the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.[48] Now the goddess Dawn drew close to tall Olympos  p 14  [49] with her message of light to Zeus and the other immortals.[50] But Agamemnon commanded his clear-voiced heralds to summon[51] by proclamation to assembly the flowing-haired Achaians,[52] and the heralds made their cry and the men were assembled swiftly.[53] First he held a council session of the high-hearted princes[54] beside the ship of Nestor, the king of the race of Pylos.[55] Summoning these he compacted before them his close counsel:[56] “Hear me, friends: in my sleep a Dream divine came to me[57] through the immortal night, and in appearance and stature[58] and figure it most closely resembled splendid Nestor.[59] It came and stood above my head and spoke a word to me:[60] ‘Son of wise Atreus breaker of horses, are you sleeping?[61] He should not sleep night long who is a man burdened with counsels[62] and responsibility for a people and cares so numerous.[63] Now listen quickly to what I say, since I am a messenger[64] from Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.[65] Zeus bids you arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle[66] in all haste; since now you might take the wide-wayed city[67] of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos[68] arguing the matter, since Hera has forced them all over[69] by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans[70] by Zeus’ will. Keep this within your heart.’ So speaking[71] the Dream went away on wings, and sweet sleep released me.[72] Come then, let us see if we can arm the sons of the Achaians.[73] Yet first, since it is the right way, I will make trial of them[74] by words, and tell them even to flee in their benched vessels.[75] Do you take stations here and there, to check them with orders.”[76] He spoke thus, and sat down again, and among them rose up[77] Nestor, he who ruled as a king in sandy Pylos.[78] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[79] “Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel,[80] had it been any other Achaian who told of this dream[81] we should have called it a lie and we might rather have turned from it.[82] Now he who claims to be the best of the Achaians has seen it.[83] Come then, let us see if we can arm the sons of the Achaians.”[84] So he spoke and led the way departing from the council,[85] and the rest rose to their feet, the sceptred kings, obeying[86] the shepherd of the people, and the army thronged behind them.[87] Like the swarms of clustering bees that issue forever[88] in fresh bursts from the hollow in the stone, and hang like[89] bunched grapes as they hover beneath the flowers in springtime[90] fluttering in swarms together this way and that way,[91] so the many nations of men from the ships and the shelters[92] along the front of the deep sea beach marched in order[93] by companies to the assembly, and Rumour walked blazing among them,[94] Zeus’ messenger, to hasten them along. Thus they were assembled[95] and the place of their assembly was shaken, and the earth groaned[96] as the people took their positions and there was tumult. Nine heralds[97] shouting set about putting them in order, to make them cease their[98] clamour and listen to the kings beloved of Zeus. The people[99] took their seats in sober fashion and were marshalled in their places[100] and gave over their clamouring. Powerful Agamemnon[101] stood up holding the sceptre Hephaistos had wrought him carefully.  p 15  [102] Hephaistos gave it to Zeus the king, the son of Kronos,[103] and Zeus in turn gave it to the courier Argeïphontes,[104] and lord Hermes gave it to Pelops, driver of horses,[105] and Pelops again gave it to Atreus, the shepherd of the people.[106] Atreus dying left it to Thyestes of the rich flocks,[107] And Thyestes left it in turn to Agamemnon to carry[108] and to be lord of many islands and over all Argos.[109] Leaning upon this sceptre he spoke and addressed the Argives:[110] “Fighting men and friends, o Danaans, henchmen of Ares:[111] Zeus son of Kronos has caught me fast in bitter futility.[112] He is hard; who before this time promised me and consented[113] that I might sack strong-walled Ilion and sail homeward.[114] Now he has devised a vile deception, and bids me go back[115] to Argos in dishonour having lost many of my people.[116] Such is the way it will be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,[117] who before now has broken the crests of many cities[118] and will break them again, since his power is beyond all others.[119] And this shall be a thing of shame for the men hereafter[120] to be told, that so strong, so great a host of Achaians[121] carried on and fought in vain a war that was useless[122] against men fewer than they, with no accomplishment shown for it;[123] since if both sides were to be willing, Achaians and Trojans,[124] to cut faithful oaths of truce, and both to be numbered,[125] and the Trojans were to be counted by those with homes in the city,[126] while we were to be allotted in tens, we Achaians,[127] and each one of our tens chose a man of Troy to pour wine for it,[128] still there would be many tens left without a wine steward.[129] By so much I claim we sons of the Achaians outnumber[130] the Trojans—those who live in the city; but there are companions[131] from other cities in their numbers, wielders of the spear, to help them,[132] who drive me hard back again and will not allow me,[133] despite my will, to sack the well-founded stronghold of Ilion.[134] And now nine years of mighty Zeus have gone by, and the timbers[135] of our ships have rotted away and the cables are broken[136] and far away our own wives and our young children[137] are sitting within our halls and wait for us, while still our work here[138] stays forever unfinished as it is, for whose sake we came hither.[139] Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us[140] run away with our ships to the beloved land of our fathers[141] since no longer now shall we capture Troy of the wide ways.”[142] So he spoke, and stirred up the passion in the breast of all those[143] who were within that multitude and listened to his counsel.[144] And the assembly was shaken as on the sea the big waves[145] in the main by Ikaria, when the south and south-east winds[146] driving down from the clouds of Zeus the father whip them.[147] As when the west wind moves across the grain deep standing,[148] boisterously, and shakes and sweeps it till the tassels lean, so[149] all of that assembly was shaken, and the men in tumult[150] swept to the ships, and underneath their feet the dust lifted[151] and rose high, and the men were all shouting to one another[152] to lay hold on the ships and drag them down to the bright sea.[153] They cleaned out the keel channels and their cries hit skyward[154] as they made for home and snatched the props from under the vessels.  p 16  [155] Then for the Argives a homecoming beyond fate might have[156] been accomplished, had not Hera spoken a word to Athene:[157] “For shame, now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.[158] As things are, the Argives will take flight homeward over[159] the wide ridges of the sea to the land of their fathers,[160] and thus they would leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen[161] of Argos, to glory over, for whose sake many Achaians[162] lost their lives in Troy far from their own native country.[163] But go now along the host of the bronze-armoured Achaians.[164] Speak to each man in words of gentleness and draw him backward[165] nor let them drag down to the salt sea their oarswept vessels.”[166] So she spoke, nor did the goddess grey-eyed Athene[167] disobey her, but went in speed down the peaks of Olympos,[168] and lightly she arrived beside the fast ships of the Achaians.[169] There she came on Odysseus, the equal of Zeus in counsel,[170] standing still; he had laid no hand upon his black, strong-benched[171] vessel, since disappointment touched his heart and his spirit.[172] Athene of the grey eyes stood beside him and spoke to him:[173] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:[174] will it be this way? Will you all hurl yourselves into your benched ships[175] and take flight homeward to the beloved land of your fathers,[176] and would you thus leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen[177] of Argos, to glory over, for whose sake many Achaians[178] lost their lives in Troy far from their own native country?[179] Go now along the host of the Achaians, give way no longer,[180] speak to each man in words of gentleness and draw them backward,[181] nor let them drag down to the salt sea their oarswept vessels.”[182] So she spoke, and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking[183] and went on the run, throwing aside his cloak, which was caught up[184] by Eurybates the herald of Ithaka who followed him.[185] He came face to face with Agamemnon, son of Atreus,[186] and took from him the sceptre of his fathers, immortal forever.[187] With this he went beside the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.[188] Whenever he encountered some king, or man of influence,[189] he would stand beside him and with soft words try to restrain him:[190] “Excellency! It does not become you to be frightened like any[191] coward. Rather hold fast and check the rest of the people.[192] You do not yet clearly understand the purpose of Atreides.[193] Now he makes trial, but soon will bear hard on the sons of the Achaians.[194] Did we not all hear what he was saying in council?[195] May he not in anger do some harm to the sons of the Achaians![196] For the anger of god-supported kings is a big matter,[197] to whom honour and love are given from Zeus of the counsels.”[198] When he saw some man of the people who was shouting,[199] he would strike at him with his staff, and reprove him also:[200] “Excellency! Sit still and listen to what others tell you,[201] to those who are better men than you, you skulker and coward[202] and thing of no account whatever in battle or council.[203] Surely not all of us Achaians can be as kings here.[204] Lordship for many is no good thing. Let there be one ruler,[205] one king, to whom the son of devious-devising Kronos[206] gives the sceptre and right of judgment, to watch over his people.”  p 17  [207] So he went through the army marshalling it, until once more[208] they swept back into the assembly place from the ships and the shelters[209] clamorously, as when from the thunderous sea the surf-beat[210] crashes upon the great beach, and the whole sea is in tumult.[211] Now the rest had sat down, and were orderly in their places,[212] but one man, Thersites of the endless speech, still scolded,[213] who knew within his head many words, but disorderly;[214] vain, and without decency, to quarrel with the princes[215] with any word he thought might be amusing to the Argives.[216] This was the ugliest man who came beneath Ilion. He was[217] bandy-legged and went lame of one foot, with shoulders[218] stooped and drawn together over his chest, and above this[219] his skull went up to a point with the wool grown sparsely upon it.[220] Beyond all others Achilleus hated him, and Odysseus.[221] These two he was forever abusing, but now at brilliant[222] Agamemnon he clashed the shrill noise of his abuse. The Achaians[223] were furiously angry with him, their minds resentful.[224] But he, crying the words aloud, scolded Agamemnon:[225] “Son of Atreus, what thing further do you want, or find fault with[226] now? Your shelters are filled with bronze, there are plenty of the choicest[227] women for you within your shelter, whom we Achaians[228] give to you first of all whenever we capture some stronghold.[229] Or is it still more gold you will be wanting, that some son[230] of the Trojans, breakers of horses, brings as ransom out of Ilion,[231] one that I, or some other Achaian, capture and bring in?[232] Is it some young woman to lie with in love and keep her[233] all to yourself apart from the others? It is not right for[234] you, their leader, to lead in sorrow the sons of the Achaians.[235] My good fools, poor abuses, you women, not men, of Achaia,[236] let us go back home in our ships, and leave this man here[237] by himself in Troy to mull his prizes of honour[238] that he may find out whether or not we others are helping him.[239] And now he has dishonoured Achilleus, a man much better[240] than he is. He has taken his prize by force and keeps her.[241] But there is no gall in Achilleus’ heart, and he is forgiving.[242] Otherwise, son of Atreus, this were your last outrage.”[243] So he spoke, Thersites, abusing Agamemnon[244] the shepherd of the people. But brilliant Odysseus swiftly[245] came beside him scowling and laid a harsh word upon him:[246] “Fluent orator though you be, Thersites, your words are[247] ill-considered. Stop, nor stand up alone against princes.[248] Out of all those who came beneath Ilion with Atreides[249] I assert there is no worse man than you are. Therefore[250] you shall not lift up your mouth to argue with princes,[251] cast reproaches into their teeth, nor sustain the homegoing.[252] We do not even know clearly how these things will be accomplished,[253] whether we sons of the Achaians shall win home well or badly;[254] yet you sit here throwing abuse at Agamemnon,[255] Atreus’ son, the shepherd of the people, because the Danaan[256] fighters give him much. You argue nothing but scandal.[257] And this also will I tell you, and it will be a thing accomplished.[258] If once more I find you playing the fool, as you are now,  p 18  [259] nevermore let the head of Odysseus sit on his shoulders,[260] let me nevermore be called Telemachos’ father,[261] if I do not take you and strip away your personal clothing,[262] your mantle and your tunic that cover over your nakedness,[263] and send you thus bare and howling back to the fast ships,[264] whipping you out of the assembly place with the strokes of indignity.”[265] So he spoke and dashed the sceptre against his back and[266] shoulders, and he doubled over, and a round tear dropped from him,[267] and a bloody welt stood up between his shoulders under[268] the golden sceptre’s stroke, and he sat down again, frightened,[269] in pain, and looking helplessly about wiped off the tear-drops.[270] Sorry though the men were they laughed over him happily,[271] and thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the man next him:[272] “Come now: Odysseus has done excellent things by thousands,[273] bringing forward good counsels and ordering armed encounters;[274] but now this is far the best thing he ever has accomplished[275] among the Argives, to keep this thrower of words, this braggart[276] out of assembly. Never again will his proud heart stir him[277] up, to wrangle with the princes in words of revilement.”[278] So the multitude spoke, but Odysseus, sacker of cities,[279] stood up holding the staff, and beside him grey-eyed Athene[280] in the likeness of a herald enjoined the people to silence,[281] that at once the foremost and the utmost sons of the Achaians[282] might listen to him speaking and deliberate his counsel.[283] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[284] “Son of Atreus: now, my lord, the Achaians are trying[285] to make you into a thing of reproach in the sight of all mortal[286] men, and not fulfilling the promise they undertook once[287] as they set forth to come here from horse-pasturing Argos,[288] to go home only after you had sacked strong-walled Ilion.[289] For as if they were young children or widowed women[290] they cry out and complain to each other about going homeward.[291] In truth, it is a hard thing, to be grieved with desire for going.[292] Any man who stays away one month from his own wife[293] with his intricate ship is impatient, one whom the storm winds[294] of winter and the sea rising keep back. And for us now[295] this is the ninth of the circling years that we wait here. Therefore[296] I cannot find fault with the Achaians for their impatience[297] beside the curved ships; yet always it is disgraceful[298] to wait long and at the end go home empty-handed.[299] No, but be patient, friends, and stay yet a little longer[300] until we know whether Kalchas’ prophecy is true or is not true.[301] For I remember this thing well in my heart, and you all are[302] witnesses, whom the spirits of death have not carried away from us;[303] yesterday and before, at Aulis, when the ships of the Achaians[304] were gathered bringing disaster to the Trojans and Priam,[305] and we beside a spring and upon the sacred altars[306] were accomplishing complete hecatombs to the immortals[307] under a fair plane tree whence ran the shining of water.[308] There appeared a great sign; a snake, his back blood-mottled,[309] a thing of horror, cast into the light by the very Olympian,[310] wound its way from under the altar and made toward the plane tree.  p 19  [311] Thereupon were innocent children, the young of the sparrow,[312] cowering underneath the leaves at the uttermost branch tip,[313] eight of them, and the mother was the ninth, who bore these children.[314] The snake ate them all after their pitiful screaming,[315] and the mother, crying aloud for her young ones, fluttered about him,[316] and as she shrilled he caught her by the wing and coiled around her.[317] After he had eaten the sparrow herself with her children[318] the god who had shown the snake forth made him a monument,[319] striking him stone, the son of devious-devising Kronos,[320] and we standing about marvelled at the thing that had been done.[321] So as the terror and the god’s monsters came into the hecatomb[322] Kalchas straightway spoke before us interpreting the gods’ will:[323] ‘Why are you turned voiceless, you flowing-haired Achaians?[324] Zeus of the counsels has shown us this great portent: a thing late,[325] late to be accomplished, whose glory shall perish never.[326] As this snake has eaten the sparrow herself with her children,[327] eight of them, and the mother was the ninth, who bore them,[328] so for years as many as this shall we fight in this place[329] and in the tenth year we shall take the city of the wide ways.’[330] So he spoke to us then; now all this is being accomplished.[331] Come then, you strong-greaved Achaians, let every man stay[332] here, until we have taken the great citadel of Priam.”[333] So he spoke, and the Argives shouted aloud, and about them[334] the ships echoed terribly to the roaring Achaians[335] as they cried out applause to the word of godlike Odysseus.[336] Now among them spoke the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:[337] “Oh, for shame! You are like children when you hold assembly,[338] infant children, to whom the works of war mean nothing.[339] Where then shall our covenants go, and the oaths we have taken?[340] Let counsels and the meditations of men be given to the flames then,[341] with the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted.[342] We do our fighting with words only, and can discover[343] no remedy, though we have stayed here a long time. Son of Atreus,[344] do you still as before hold fast to your counsel unshaken[345] and be the leader of the Argives through the strong encounters;[346] let them go perish, these one or two, who think apart from[347] the rest of the Achaians, since there will be no use in them[348] until they get back again to Argos without ever learning[349] whether Zeus of the aegis promises false or truly.[350] For I say to you, the son of all-powerful Kronos[351] promised, on that day when we went in our fast-running vessels,[352] we of Argos, carrying blood and death to the Trojans.[353] He flashed lightning on our right, showing signs of favour.[354] Therefore let no man be urgent to take the way homeward[355] until after he has lain in bed with the wife of a Trojan[356] to avenge Helen’s longing to escape and her lamentations.[357] But if any man is terribly desirous to go home,[358] let him only lay his hands on his well-benched black ship,[359] that before all others he may win death and destruction.[360] Come, my lord: yourself be careful, and listen to another.[361] This shall not be a word to be cast away that I tell you.[362] Set your men in order by tribes, by clans, Agamemnon,  p 20  [363] and let clan go in support of clan, let tribe support tribe.[364] If you do it this way, and the Achaians obey you,[365] you will see which of your leaders is bad, and which of your people,[366] and which also is brave, since they will fight in divisions,[367] and might learn also whether by magic you fail to take this[368] city, or by men’s cowardice and ignorance of warfare.”[369] Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:[370] “Once again, old sir, you surpass the sons of the Achaians[371] in debate. O father Zeus, Athene, Apollo:[372] would that among the Achaians I had ten such counsellors.[373] Then perhaps the city of lord Priam would be bent[374] underneath our hands, captured and sacked. But instead[375] Zeus of the aegis, son of Kronos, has given me bitterness,[376] who drives me into unprofitable abuse and quarrels.[377] For I and Achilleus fought together for a girl’s sake[378] in words’ violent encounter, and I was the first to be angry.[379] If ever we can take one single counsel, then no longer[380] shall the Trojans’ evil be put aside, not even for a small time.[381] Now go back, take your dinner, and let us gather our warcraft.[382] Let a man put a good edge to his spear, and his shield in order,[383] let each put good fodder before his swift-footed horses,[384] and each man look well over his chariot, careful of his fighting,[385] that all day long we may be in the division of hateful Ares.[386] There will not even for a small time be any respite[387] unless darkness come down to separate the strength of the fighters.[388] There will be a man’s sweat on the shield-strap binding the breast to[389] the shield hiding the man’s shape, and the hand on the spear grow weary.[390] There will be sweat on a man’s horse straining at the smoothed chariot.[391] But any man whom I find trying, apart from the battle,[392] to hang back by the curved ships, for him no longer[393] will there be any means to escape the dogs and the vultures.”[394] So he spoke, and the Argives shouted aloud, as surf crashing[395] against a sheer ness, driven by the south wind descending,[396] some cliff out-jutting, left never alone by the waves from[397] all the winds that blow, as they rise one place and another.[398] They stood up scattering and made for the ships; they kindled[399] the fires’ smoke along the shelters, and took their dinner,[400] each man making a sacrifice to some one of the immortal[401] gods, in prayer to escape death and the grind of Ares.[402] But Agamemnon the lord of men dedicated a fat ox[403] five years old to Zeus, all-powerful son of Kronos,[404] and summoned the nobles and the great men of all the Achaians,[405] Nestor before all others, and next the lord Idomeneus,[406] next the two Aiantes and Tydeus’ son Diomedes,[407] and sixth Odysseus, a man like Zeus himself for counsel.[408] Of his own accord came Menelaos of the great war cry[409] who knew well in his own mind the cares of his brother.[410] They stood in a circle about the ox and took up the scattering[411] barley; and among them powerful Agamemnon spoke in prayer:[412] “Zeus, exalted and mightiest, sky-dwelling in the dark mist:[413] let not the sun go down and disappear into darkness[414] until I have hurled headlong the castle of Priam  p 21  [415] blazing, and lit the castle gates with the flames’ destruction;[416] not till I have broken at the chest the tunic of Hektor[417] torn with the bronze blade, and let many companions about him[418] go down headlong into the dust, teeth gripping the ground soil.”[419] He spoke, but none of this would the son of Kronos accomplish,[420] who accepted the victims, but piled up the unwished-for hardship.[421] Now when all had made prayer and flung down the scattering barley,[422] first they drew back the victim’s head, cut his throat and skinned him,[423] and cut away the meat from the thighs and wrapped them in fat,[424] making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh above them.[425] Placing these on sticks cleft and peeled they burned them,[426] and spitted the vitals and held them over the flame of Hephaistos.[427] But when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals[428] they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them[429] and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.[430] Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready[431] they feasted, nor was any man’s hunger denied a fair portion.[432] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking[433] the Gerenian horseman Nestor began speaking among them:[434] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[435] let us talk no more of these things, nor for a long time[436] set aside the action which the god puts into our hands now.[437] Come then, let the heralds of the bronze-armoured Achaians[438] make proclamation to the people and assemble them by the vessels,[439] and let us together as we are go down the wide host[440] of the Achaians, to stir more quickly the fierce war god.”[441] He spoke, nor did the lord of men Agamemnon neglect him,[442] but straightway commanded the clear-voiced heralds to summon[443] by proclamation to battle the flowing-haired Achaians;[444] and the heralds made their cry and the men were assembled swiftly.[445] And they, the god-supported kings, about Agamemnon[446] ran marshalling the men, and among them grey-eyed Athene[447] holding the dear treasured aegis, ageless, immortal,[448] from whose edges float a hundred all-golden tassels,[449] each one carefully woven, and each worth a hundred oxen.[450] With this fluttering she swept through the host of the Achaians[451] urging them to go forward. She kindled the strength in each man’s[452] heart to take the battle without respite and keep on fighting.[453] And now battle became sweeter to them than to go back[454] in their hollow ships to the beloved land of their fathers.[455] As obliterating fire lights up a vast forest[456] along the crests of a mountain, and the flare shows far off,[457] so as they marched, from the magnificent bronze the gleam went[458] dazzling all about through the upper air to the heaven.[459] These, as the multitudinous nations of birds winged,[460] of geese, and of cranes, and of swans long-throated[461] in the Asian meadow beside the Kaÿstrian waters[462] this way and that way make their flights in the pride of their wings, then[463] settle in clashing swarms and the whole meadow echoes with them,[464] so of these the multitudinous tribes from the ships and[465] shelters poured to the plain of Skamandros, and the earth beneath their[466] feet and under the feet of their horses thundered horribly.  p 22  [467] They took position in the blossoming meadow of Skamandros,[468] thousands of them, as leaves and flowers appear in their season.[469] Like the multitudinous nations of swarming insects[470] who drive hither and thither about the stalls of the sheepfold[471] in the season of spring when the milk splashes in the milk pails:[472] in such numbers the flowing-haired Achaians stood up[473] through the plain against the Trojans, hearts burning to break them.[474] These, as men who are goatherds among the wide goatflocks[475] easily separate them in order as they take to the pasture,[476] thus the leaders separated them this way and that way[477] toward the encounter, and among them powerful Agamemnon,[478] with eyes and head like Zeus who delights in thunder,[479] like Ares for girth, and with the chest of Poseidon;[480] like some ox of the herd pre-eminent among the others,[481] a bull, who stands conspicuous in the huddling cattle;[482] such was the son of Atreus as Zeus made him that day,[483] conspicuous among men, and foremost among the fighters.[484] Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos.[485] For you, who are goddesses, are there, and you know all things,[486] and we have heard only the rumour of it and know nothing.[487] Who then of those were the chief men and the lords of the Danaans?[488] I could not tell over the multitude of them nor name them,[489] not if I had ten tongues and ten mouths, not if I had[490] a voice never to be broken and a heart of bronze within me,[491] not unless the Muses of Olympia, daughters[492] of Zeus of the aegis, remembered all those who came beneath Ilion.[493] I will tell the lords of the ships, and the ships’ numbers.[494] Leïtos and Peneleos were leaders of the Boiotians,[495] with Arkesilaos and Prothoenor and Klonios;[496] they who lived in Hyria and in rocky Aulis,[497] in the hill-bends of Eteonos, and Schoinos, and Skolos,[498] Thespeia and Graia, and in spacious Mykalessos;[499] they who dwelt about Harma and Eilesion and Erythrai,[500] they who held Eleon and Hyle and Peteon,[501] with Okalea and Medeon, the strong-founded citadel,[502] Kopai, and Eutresis, and Thisbe of the dove-cotes;[503] they who held Koroneia, and the meadows of Haliartos,[504] they who held Plataia, and they who dwelt about Glisa,[505] they who held the lower Thebes, the strong-founded citadel,[506] and Onchestos the sacred, the shining grove of Poseidon;[507] they who held Arne of the great vineyards, and Mideia,[508] with Nisa the sacrosanct and uttermost Anthedon.[509] Of these there were fifty ships in all, and on board[510] each of these a hundred and twenty sons of the Boiotians.[511] But they who lived in Aspledon and Orchomenos of the Minyai,[512] Askalaphos led these, and Ialmenos, children of Ares,[513] whom Astyoche bore to him in the house of Aktor[514] Azeus’ son, a modest maiden; she went into the chamber[515] with strong Ares, who was laid in bed with her secretly.[516] With these two there were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.[517] Schedios and Epistrophos led the men of Phokis,[518] children of Iphitos, who was son of great-hearted Naubolos.  p 23  [519] These held Kyparissos, and rocky Pytho, and Krisa[520] the sacrosanct together with Daulis and Panopeus;[521] they who lived about Hyampolis and Anamoreia,[522] they who dwelt about Kephisos, the river immortal,[523] they who held Lilaia beside the well springs of Kephisos.[524] Following along with these were forty black ships,[525] and the leaders marshalling the ranks of the Phokians set them[526] in arms on the left wing of the host beside the Boiotians.[527] Swift Aias son of Oïleus led the men of Lokris,[528] the lesser Aias, not great in size like the son of Telamon,[529] but far slighter. He was a small man armoured in linen,[530] yet with the throwing spear surpassed all Achaians and Hellenes.[531] These were the dwellers in Kynos and Opoeis and Kalliaros,[532] and in Bessa, and Skarphe, and lovely Augeiai,[533] in Thronion and Tarphe and beside the waters of Boagrios.[534] Following along with him were forty black ships[535] of the Lokrians, who dwell across from sacred Euboia.[536] They who held Euboia, the Abantes, whose wind was fury,[537] Chalkis, and Eretria, the great vineyards of Histiaia,[538] and seaborne Kerinthos and the steep stronghold of Dion,[539] they who held Karystos and they who dwelt about Styra,[540] of these the leader was Elephenor, scion of Ares,[541] son of Chalkodon and lord of the great-hearted Abantes.[542] And the running Abantes followed with him, their hair grown[543] long at the back, spearmen furious with the out-reached ash spear[544] to rip the corselets girt about the chests of their enemies.[545] Following along with him were forty black ships.[546] But the men who held Athens, the strong-founded citadel,[547] the deme of great-hearted Erechtheus, whom once Athene[548] Zeus’ daughter tended after the grain-giving fields had born him,[549] and established him to be in Athens in her own rich temple;[550] there as the circling years go by the sons of the Athenians[551] make propitiation with rams and bulls sacrificed;[552] of these men the leader was Peteos’ son Menestheus.[553] Never on earth before had there been a man born like him[554] for the arrangement in order of horses and shielded fighters.[555] Nestor alone could challenge him, since he was far older.[556] Following along with him were fifty black ships.[557] Out of Salamis Aias brought twelve ships and placed them[558] next to where the Athenian battalions were drawn up.[559] They who held Argos and Tiryns of the huge walls,[560] Hermione and Asine lying down the deep gulf,[561] Troizen and Eïonai, and Epidauros of the vineyards,[562] they who held Aigina and Mases, sons of the Achaians,[563] of these the leader was Diomedes of the great war cry[564] with Sthenelos, own son to the high-renowned Kapaneus,[565] and with them as a third went Euryalos, a man godlike,[566] son of Mekisteus the king, and scion of Talaos;[567] but the leader of all was Diomedes of the great war cry.[568] Following along with these were eighty black ships.[569] But the men who held Mykenai, the strong-founded citadel,[570] Korinth the luxurious, and strong-founded Kleonai;  p 24  [571] they who dwelt in Orneai and lovely Araithyrea,[572] and Sikyon, where of old Adrestos had held the kingship;[573] they who held Hyperesia and steep Gonoëssa,[574] they who held Pellene and they who dwelt about Aigion,[575] all about the sea-shore and about the wide headland of Helike,[576] of their hundred ships the leader was powerful Agamemnon,[577] Atreus’ son, with whom followed far the best and bravest[578] people; and among them he himself stood armoured in shining[579] bronze, glorying, conspicuous among the great fighters,[580] since he was greatest among them all, and led the most people.[581] They who held the swarming hollow of Lakedaimon,[582] Pharis, and Sparta, and Messe of the dove-cotes,[583] they who dwelt in Bryseiai and lovely Augeiai,[584] they who held Amyklai and the seaward city of Helos,[585] they who held Laas, and they who dwelt about Oitylos,[586] of these his brother Menelaos of the great war cry[587] was leader, with sixty ships marshalled apart from the others.[588] He himself went among them in the confidence of his valour,[589] driving them battleward, since above all his heart was eager[590] to avenge Helen’s longing to escape and her lamentations.[591] They who dwelt about Pylos and lovely Arene,[592] and Thryon, the Alpheios crossing, and strong-built Aipy;[593] they who lived in Kyparisseeis and Amphigeneia,[594] Pteleos and Helos and Dorion, where the Muses[595] encountering Thamyris the Thracian stopped him from singing[596] as he came from Oichalia and Oichalian Eurytos;[597] for he boasted that he would surpass, if the very Muses,[598] daughters of Zeus who holds the aegis, were singing against him,[599] and these in their anger struck him maimed, and the voice of wonder[600] they took away, and made him a singer without memory;[601] of these the leader was the Gerenian horseman, Nestor,[602] in whose command were marshalled ninety hollow vessels.[603] They who held Arkadia under the sheer peak, Kyllene,[604] beside the tomb of Aipytos, where men fight at close quarters,[605] they who dwelt in Orchomenos of the flocks, and Pheneos,[606] about Rhipe and Stratia and windy Enispe;[607] they who held Tegea and Mantineia the lovely,[608] they who held Stymphalos, and dwelt about Parrhasia,[609] their leader was Angkaios’ son, powerful Agapenor.[610] Sixty was the number of their ships, and in each ship[611] went many men of Arkadia, well skilled in battle.[612] Agamemnon the lord of men himself had given[613] these for the crossing of the wine-blue sea their strong-benched vessels,[614] Atreus’ son, since the work of the sea was nothing to these men.[615] They who lived in Bouprasion and brilliant Elis,[616] all as much as Hyrmine and Myrsinos the uttermost[617] and the Olenian rock and Alesion close between them,[618] of these there were four chieftains, and with each man ten swift[619] vessels followed, with many Epeian men on board them.[620] Of two tens Thalpios and Amphimachos were leaders,[621] of Aktor’s seed, sons one of Kteatos, one of Eurytos.  p 25  [622] Ten more were led by Amaryngkeus’ son, strong Diores,[623] and of the fourth ten godlike Polyxeinos was leader,[624] son of lord Agasthenes, of the race of Augeias.[625] They who came from Doulichion and the sacred Echinai,[626] islands, where men live across the water from Elis,[627] Meges was the leader of these, a man like Ares,[628] Phyleus’ son, whom the rider dear to Zeus had begotten,[629] Phyleus, who angered with his father had settled Doulichion.[630] Following along with him were forty black ships.[631] But Odysseus led the high-hearted men of Kephallenia,[632] those who held Ithaka and leaf-trembling Neriton,[633] those who dwelt about Krokyleia and rigged Aigilips,[634] those who held Zakynthos and those who dwelt about Samos,[635] those who held the mainland and the places next to the crossing.[636] All these men were led by Odysseus, like Zeus in counsel.[637] Following with him were twelve ships with bows red painted.[638] Thoas son of Andraimon was leader of the Aitolians,[639] those who dwelt in Pleuron and Olenos and Pylene,[640] Kalydon of the rocks and Chalkis beside the sea-shore,[641] since no longer were the sons of high-hearted Oineus living,[642] nor Oineus himself, and fair-haired Meleagros had perished.[643] So all the lordship of the Aitolians was given to Thoas.[644] Following along with him were forty black ships.[645] Idomeneus the spear-famed was leader of the Kretans,[646] those who held Knosos and Gortyna of the great walls,[647] Lyktos and Miletos and silver-shining Lykastos,[648] and Phaistos and Rhytion, all towns well established,[649] and others who dwelt beside them in Krete of the hundred cities.[650] Of all these Idomeneus the spear-famed was leader,[651] with Meriones, a match for the murderous Lord of Battles.[652] Following along with these were eighty black ships.[653] Herakles’ son Tlepolemos the huge and mighty[654] led from Rhodes nine ships with the proud men of Rhodes aboard them,[655] those who dwelt about Rhodes and were ordered in triple division,[656] Ialysos and Lindos and silver-shining Kameiros.[657] Of all these Tlepolemos the spear famed was leader,[658] he whom Astyocheia bore to the strength of Herakles.[659] Herakles brought her from Ephyra and the river Selleëis[660] after he sacked many cities of strong, god-supported fighters.[661] Now when Tlepolemos was grown in the strong-built mansion,[662] he struck to death his own father’s beloved uncle,[663] Likymnios, scion of Ares, a man already ageing.[664] At once he put ships together and assembled a host of people[665] and went fugitive over the sea, since the others threatened,[666] the rest of the sons and the grandsons of the strength of Herakles.[667] And he came to Rhodes a wanderer, a man of misfortune,[668] and they settled there in triple division by tribes, beloved[669] of Zeus himself, who is lord over all gods and all men,[670] Kronos’ son, who showered the wonder of wealth upon them.[671] Nireus from Syme led three balanced vessels,[672] Nireus son of Aglaia and the king Charopos,  p 26  [673] Nireus, the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion[674] beyond the rest of the Danaans next after perfect Achilleus.[675] But he was a man of poor strength and few people with him.[676] They who held Nisyros and Krapathos and Kasos,[677] and Kos, Eurypylos’ city, and the islands called Kalydnai,[678] and these again Pheidippos and Antiphos were the leaders,[679] sons both of Thessalos who was born to the lord Herakles.[680] In their command were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.[681] Now all those who dwelt about Pelasgian Argos,[682] those who lived by Alos and Alope and at Trachis,[683] those who held Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women,[684] who were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaians,[685] of all these and their fifty ships the lord was Achilleus.[686] But these took no thought now for the grim clamour of battle[687] since there was no one who could guide them into close order,[688] since he, swift-footed brilliant Achilleus, lay where the ships were,[689] angered over the girl of the lovely hair, Briseis,[690] whom after much hard work he had taken away from Lyrnessos[691] after he had sacked Lyrnessos and the walls of Thebe[692] and struck down Epistrophos and Mynes the furious spearmen,[693] children of Euenos, king, and son of Selepios.[694] For her sake he lay grieving now, but was soon to rise up.[695] They who held Phylake and Pyrasos of the flowers,[696] the precinct of Demeter, and Iton, mother of sheepflocks,[697] Antron by the sea-shore, and Pteleos deep in the meadows,[698] of these in turn fighting Protesilaos was leader[699] while he lived; but now the black earth had closed him under,[700] whose wife, cheeks torn for grief, was left behind in Phylake[701] and a marriage half completed; a Dardanian man had killed him[702] as he leapt from his ship, far the first of all the Achaians.[703] Yet these, longing as they did for their leader, did not go leaderless,[704] but Podarkes, scion of Ares, set them in order,[705] child of Iphikles, who in turn was son to Phylakos[706] rich in flocks, full brother of high-hearted Protesilaos,[707] younger born; but the elder man was braver also,[708] Protesilaos, a man of battle; yet still the people[709] lacked not a leader, though they longed for him and his valour.[710] Following along with Podarkes were forty black ships.[711] They who lived by Pherai beside the lake Boibeis,[712] by Boibe and Glaphyrai and strong-founded Iolkos,[713] of their eleven ships the dear son of Admetos was leader,[714] Eumelos, born to Admetos by the beauty among women[715] Alkestis, loveliest of all the daughters of Pelias.[716] They who lived about Thaumakia and Methone,[717] they who held Meliboia and rugged Olizon,[718] of their seven ships the leader was Philoktetes[719] skilled in the bow’s work, and aboard each vessel were fifty[720] oarsmen, each well skilled in the strength of the bow in battle.[721] Yet he himself lay apart in the island, suffering strong pains,[722] in Lemnos the sacrosanct, where the sons of the Achaians had left him[723] in agony from the sore bite of the wicked water snake.[724] There he lay apart in his pain; yet soon the Argives  p 27  [725] beside their ships were to remember lord Philoktetes.[726] Yet these, longing as they did for their leader, did not go leaderless,[727] but Medon, the bastard son of Oïleus, set them in order,[728] whom Rhene bore to Oïleus the sacker of cities.[729] They who held Trikke and the terraced place of Ithome,[730] and Oichalia, the city of Oichalian Eurytos,[731] of these in turn the leaders were two sons of Asklepios,[732] good healers both themselves, Podaleirios and Machaon.[733] In their command were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.[734] They who held Ormenios and the spring Hypereia,[735] they who held Asterion and the pale peaks of Titanos,[736] Eurypylos led these, the shining son of Euaimon.[737] Following along with him were forty black ships.[738] They who held Argissa and dwelt about Gyrtone,[739] Orthe and Elone and the white city Oloösson,[740] of these the leader was Polypoites, stubborn in battle,[741] son of Peirithoös whose father was Zeus immortal,[742] he whom glorious Hippodameia bore to Peirithoös[743] on that day when he wreaked vengeance on the hairy beast men[744] and drove them from Pelion and hurled them against the Aithikes;[745] not by himself, for Leonteus was with him, scion of Ares,[746] Leonteus, son of high-hearted Koronos the son of Kaineus.[747] Following in the guidance of these were forty black ships.[748] Gouneus from Kyphos led two and twenty vessels,[749] and the Enienes and the Perrhaibians stubborn in battle[750] followed him, they who made their homes by wintry Dodona,[751] and they who by lovely Titaressos held the tilled acres,[752] Titaressos, who into Peneios casts his bright current:[753] yet he is not mixed with the silver whirls of Peneios,[754] but like oil is floated along the surface above him:[755] since he is broken from the water of Styx, the fearful oath-river.[756] Prothoös son of Tenthredon was leader of the Magnesians,[757] those who dwelt about Peneios and leaf-trembling[758] Pelion. Of these Prothoos the swift-footed was leader.[759] Following along with him were forty black ships.[760] These then were the leaders and the princes among the Danaans.[761] Tell me then, Muse, who of them all was the best and bravest,[762] of the men, and the men’s horses, who went with the sons of Atreus.[763] Best by far among the horses were the mares of Eumelos[764] Pheres’ son, that he drove, swift-moving like birds, alike in[765] texture of coat, in age, both backs drawn level like a plumb-line.[766] These Apollo of the silver bow had bred in Pereia,[767] mares alike, who went with the terror of the god of battle.[768] Among the men far the best was Telamonian Aias[769] while Achilleus stayed angry, since he was far best of all of them,[770] and the horses also, who carried the blameless son of Peleus.[771] But Achilleus lay apart among his curved sea-wandering[772] vessels, raging at Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people,[773] Atreus’ son; and his men beside the break of the sea-beach[774] amused themselves with discs and with light spears for throwing[775] and bows; and the horses, standing each beside his chariot,[776] champed their clover and the parsley that grows in wet places,  p 28  [777] resting, while the chariots of their lords stood covered[778] in the shelters, and the men forlorn of their warlike leader[779] wandered here and there in the camp, and did no fighting.[780] But the rest went forward, as if all the earth with flame were eaten,[781] and the ground echoed under them, as if Zeus who delights in thunder[782] were angry, as when he batters the earth about Typhoeus,[783] in the land of the Arimoi, where they say Typhoeus lies prostrate.[784] Thus beneath their feet the ground re-echoed loudly[785] to men marching, who made their way through the plain in great speed.[786] Now to the Trojans came as messenger wind-footed Iris,[787] in her speed, with the dark message from Zeus of the aegis.[788] These were holding assembly in front of the doors of Priam[789] gathered together in one place, the elders and the young men.[790] Standing close at hand swift-running Iris spoke to them,[791] and likened her voice to that of the son of Priam, Polites,[792] who confident in the speed of his feet kept watch for the Trojans[793] aloft the ancient burial mound of ancient Aisyetes,[794] waiting for the time when the Achaians should move from their vessels.[795] In this man’s likeness Iris the swift-running spoke to them:[796] “Old sir, dear to you forever are words beyond number[797] as once, when there was peace; but stintless war has arisen.[798] In my time I have gone into many battles among men,[799] yet never have I seen a host like this, not one so numerous.[800] These look terribly like leaves, or the sands of the sea-shore,[801] as they advance across the plain to fight by the city.[802] Hektor, on you beyond all I urge this, to do as I tell you:[803] all about the great city of Priam are many companions,[804] but multitudinous is the speech of the scattered nations:[805] let each man who is their leader give orders to these men,[806] and let each set his citizens in order, and lead them.”[807] She spoke, nor did Hektor fail to mark the word of the goddess.[808] Instantly he broke up the assembly; they ran to their weapons.[809] All the gates were opened and the people swept through them[810] on foot, and with horses, and a clamour of shouting rose up.[811] Near the city but apart from it there is a steep hill[812] in the plain by itself, so you pass one side or the other.[813] This men call the Hill of the Thicket, but the immortal[814] gods have named it the burial mound of dancing Myrina.[815] There the Trojans and their companions were marshalled in order.[816] Tall Hektor of the shining helm was leader of the Trojans,[817] Priam’s son; and with him far the best and the bravest[818] fighting men were armed and eager to fight with the spear’s edge.[819] The strong son of Anchises was leader of the Dardanians,[820] Aineias, whom divine Aphrodite bore to Anchises[821] in the folds of Ida, a goddess lying in love with a mortal:[822] not Aineias alone, but with him were two sons of Antenor,[823] Archelochos and Akamas, both skilled in all fighting.[824] They who lived in Zeleia below the foot of Mount Ida,[825] men of wealth, who drank the dark water of Aisepos,[826] Trojans: of these the leader was the shining son of Lykaon,[827] Pandaros, with the bow that was actual gift of Apollo.  p 29  [828] They who held Adresteia and the countryside of Apaisos,[829] they who held Pityeia and the sheer hill of Tereia,[830] these were led by Adrestos and Amphios armoured in linen,[831] sons both of Merops of Perkote, who beyond all men[832] knew the art of prophecy, and tried to prevent his two sons[833] from going into the battle where men die. Yet these would not[834] listen, for the spirits of dark death were driving them onward.[835] They who dwelt in the places about Perkote and Praktion,[836] who held Sestos and Abydos and brilliant Arisbe,[837] their leader was Asios, Hyrtakos’ son, a prince of the people,[838] Asios, son of Hyrtakos, whom huge and shining[839] horses carried from Arisbe and the river Selleëis.[840] Hippothoös led the tribes of spear-fighting Pelasgians,[841] they who dwelt where the soil is rich about Larissa;[842] Hippothoös and Pylaios, scion of Ares, led these,[843] sons alike of Pelasgian Lethos, son of Teutamos.[844] Akamas led the men of Thrace with the fighter Peiroös,[845] all the Thracians held within the hard stream of the Hellespont.[846] Euphemos was leader of the Kikonian spearmen,[847] son of Troizenos, Keas’ son, the king whom the gods loved.[848] Pyraichmes in turn led the Paionians with their curved bows,[849] from Amydon far away and the broad stream of Axios,[850] Axios, whose stream on all earth is the loveliest water.[851] Pylaimenes the wild heart was leader of the Paphlagones,[852] from the land of the Enetoi where the wild mules are engendered,[853] those who held Kytoros and those who dwelt about Sesamos,[854] those whose renowned homes were about Parthenios river,[855] and Kromna and Aigialos and high Erythinoi.[856] Odios and Epistrophos led the Halizones[857] from Alybe far away, where silver was first begotten.[858] Chromis, with Ennomos the augur, was lord of the Mysians;[859] yet his reading of birds could not keep off dark destruction[860] but he went down under the hands of swift-running Aiakides[861] in the river, as he slew other Trojans beside him.[862] Phorkys and godlike Askanios were lords of the Phrygians[863] from Askania far away, eager to fight in the onfall.[864] Mesthles and Antiphos were leaders of the Maionians,[865] sons of Talaimenes, who was born of the lake Gygaian:[866] these led the Maionian men whose home was beneath Mount Tmolos.[867] The Karians of the outland speech were led by Nastes,[868] they who held Miletos and the leaf-deep mountain of Phthiron,[869] the waters of Maiandros and the headlong peaks of Mykale;[870] of these the two leaders were Amphimachos and Nastes,[871] Nastes and Amphimachos, the shining sons of Nomion.[872] Nastes came like a girl to the fighting in golden raiment,[873] poor fool, nor did this avail to keep dismal death back;[874] but he went down under the hands of swift-running Aiakides[875] in the river, and fiery Achilleus stripped the gold from him.[876] Sarpedon with unfaulted Glaukos was lord of the Lykians[877] from Lykia far away, and the whirling waters of Xanthos.  p 30  book three[1] Now when the men of both sides were set in order by their leaders,[2] the Trojans came on with clamour and shouting, like wildfowl,[3] as when the clamour of cranes goes high to the heavens,[4] when the cranes escape the winter time and the rains unceasing[5] and clamorously wing their way to the streaming Ocean,[6] bringing to the Pygmaian men bloodshed and destruction:[7] at daybreak they bring on the baleful battle against them.[8] But the Achaian men went silently, breathing valour,[9] stubbornly minded each in his heart to stand by the others.[10] As on the peaks of a mountain the south wind scatters the thick mist,[11] no friend to the shepherd, but better than night for the robber,[12] and a man can see before him only so far as a stone cast,[13] so beneath their feet the dust drove up in a stormcloud[14] of men marching, who made their way through the plain in great speed.[15] Now as these in their advance had come close together,[16] Alexandros the godlike leapt from the ranks of the Trojans,[17] as challenger wearing across his shoulders the hide of a leopard,[18] curved bow and sword; while in his hands shaking two javelins[19] pointed with bronze, he challenged all the best of the Argives[20] to fight man to man against him in bitter combat.[21] Now as soon as Menelaos the warlike caught sight of him[22] making his way with long strides out in front of the army,[23] he was glad, like a lion who comes on a mighty carcass,[24] in his hunger chancing upon the body of a horned stag[25] or wild goat; who eats it eagerly, although against him[26] are hastening the hounds in their speed and the stalwart young men:[27] thus Menelaos was happy finding godlike Alexandros[28] there in front of his eyes, and thinking to punish the robber,[29] straightway in all his armour he sprang to the ground from his chariot.[30] But Alexandros the godlike when he saw Menelaos[31] showing among the champions, the heart was shaken within him;[32] to avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions.[33] As a man who has come on a snake in the mountain valley[34] suddenly steps back, and the shivers come over his body,[35] and he draws back and away, cheeks seized with a green pallor;[36] so in terror of Atreus’ son godlike Alexandros[37] lost himself again in the host of the haughty Trojans.[38] But Hektor saw him and in words of shame rebuked him:[39] “Evil Paris, beautiful, woman-crazy, cajoling,[40] better had you never been born, or killed unwedded.[41] Truly I could have wished it so; it would be far better[42] than to have you with us to our shame, for others to sneer at.[43] Surely now the flowing-haired Achaians laugh at us,[44] thinking you are our bravest champion, only because your[45] looks are handsome, but there is no strength in your heart, no courage.[46] Were you like this that time when in sea-wandering vessels[47] assembling oarsmen to help you you sailed over the water,[48] and mixed with the outlanders, and carried away a fair woman[49] from a remote land, whose lord’s kin were spearmen and fighters,  p 31  [50] to your father a big sorrow, and your city, and all your people,[51] to yourself a thing shameful but bringing joy to the enemy?[52] And now you would not stand up against warlike Menelaos?[53] Thus you would learn of the man whose blossoming wife you have taken.[54] The lyre would not help you then, nor the favours of Aphrodite,[55] nor your locks, when you rolled in the dust, nor all your beauty.[56] No, but the Trojans are cowards in truth, else long before this[57] you had worn a mantle of flying stones for the wrong you did us.”[58] Then in answer Alexandros the godlike spoke to him:[59] “Hektor, seeing you have scolded me rightly, not beyond measure—[60] still, your heart forever is weariless, like an axe-blade[61] driven by a man’s strength through the timber, one who, well skilled,[62] hews a piece for a ship, driven on by the force of a man’s strength:[63] such is the heart in your breast, unshakable: yet do not[64] bring up against me the sweet favours of golden Aphrodite.[65] Never to be cast away are the gifts of the gods, magnificent,[66] which they give of their own will, no man could have them for wanting them.[67] Now though, if you wish me to fight it out and do battle,[68] make the rest of the Trojans sit down, and all the Achaians,[69] and set me in the middle with Menelaos the warlike[70] to fight together for the sake of Helen and all her possessions.[71] That one of us who wins and is proved stronger, let him[72] take the possessions fairly and the woman, and lead her homeward.[73] But the rest of you, having cut your oaths of faith and friendship,[74] dwell, you in Troy where the soil is rich, while those others return home[75] to horse-pasturing Argos, and Achaia the land of fair women.”[76] So he spoke, and Hektor hearing his word was happy[77] and went into the space between and forced back the Trojan battalions[78] holding his spear by the middle until they were all seated.[79] But the flowing-haired Achaians kept pointing their bows at him[80] with arrows and with flung stones striving ever to strike him[81] until Agamemnon lord of men cried out in a great voice:[82] “Argives, hold: cast at him no longer, o sons of the Achaians.[83] Hektor of the shining helm is trying to tell us something.”[84] So he spoke, and they stopped fighting and suddenly all fell[85] silent; but Hektor between them spoke now to both sides:[86] “Hear from me, Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians, the word[87] of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen.[88] He would have all the rest of the Trojans and all the Achaians[89] lay aside on the bountiful earth their splendid armour[90] while he himself in the middle and warlike Menelaos[91] fight alone for the sake of Helen and all her possessions.[92] That one of them who wins and is proved stronger, let him[93] take the possessions fairly and the woman, and lead her homeward[94] while the rest of us cut our oaths of faith and friendship.”[95] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence;[96] but among them spoke out Menelaos of the great war cry:[97] “Listen now to me also; since beyond all others this sorrow[98] comes closest to my heart, and I think the Argives and Trojans[99] can go free of each other at last. You have suffered much evil[100] for the sake of this my quarrel since Alexandros began it.[101] As for that one of us two to whom death and doom are given,  p 32  [102] let him die: the rest of you be made friends with each other.[103] Bring two lambs: let one be white and the other black for[104] Earth and the Sun God, and for Zeus we will bring yet another.[105] Bring, that he may seal the pledges, the strength of Priam:[106] Priam himself, for his sons are outrageous, not to be trusted;[107] lest some man overstep Zeus’ oaths, and make them be nothing.[108] Always it is, that the hearts in the younger men are frivolous,[109] but when an elder man is among them, he looks behind him[110] and in front, so that all comes out far better for both sides.”[111] So he spoke, and the Trojans and Achaians were joyful,[112] hoping now to be rid of all the sorrow of warfare.[113] They pulled their chariots into line, and themselves dismounted[114] and stripped off their armour which was laid on the ground beside them,[115] close together, so there was little ground left between them.[116] Hektor sent away to the citadel two heralds[117] lightly to bring down the lambs, and to summon Priam;[118] and powerful Agamemnon in turn sent Talthybios[119] to go down to the hollow ships, with orders to bring two[120] lambs: he did not disobey the order of great Agamemnon.[121] Now to Helen of the white arms came a messenger, Iris,[122] in the likeness of her sister-in-law, the wife of Antenor’s[123] son, whom strong Helikaon wed, the son of Antenor,[124] Laodike, loveliest looking of all the daughters of Priam.[125] She came on Helen in the chamber; she was weaving a great web,[126] a red folding robe, and working into it the numerous struggles[127] of Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,[128] struggles that they endured for her sake at the hands of the war god.[129] Iris of the swift feet stood beside her and spoke to her:[130] “Come with me, dear girl, to behold the marvellous things done[131] by Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,[132] who just now carried sorrowful war against each other,[133] in the plain, and all their desire was for deadly fighting;[134] now they are all seated in silence, the fighting has ended;[135] they lean on their shields, the tall spears stuck in the ground beside them.[136] But Menelaos the warlike and Alexandros will fight[137] with long spears against each other for your possession.[138] You shall be called beloved wife of the man who wins you.”[139] Speaking so the goddess left in her heart sweet longing[140] after her husband of time before, and her city and parents.[141] And at once, wrapping herself about in shimmering garments,[142] she went forth from the chamber, letting fall a light tear;[143] not by herself, since two handmaidens went to attend her,[144] Aithre, Pittheus’ daughter, and Klymene of the ox eyes.[145] Rapidly they came to the place where the Skaian gates stood.[146] Now those who sat with Priam: Panthoös and Thymoites,[147] Lampos and Klytios, Hiketaon, scion of Ares,[148] with Antenor and Oukalegon, both men of good counsel:[149] these were seated by the Skaian gates, elders of the people.[150] Now through old age these fought no longer, yet were they excellent[151] speakers still, and clear, as cicadas who through the forest[152] settle on trees, to issue their delicate voice of singing.[153] Such were they who sat on the tower, chief men of the Trojans.[154] And these, as they saw Helen along the tower approaching,  p 33  [155] murmuring softly to each other uttered their winged words:[156] “Surely there is no blame on Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians[157] if for long time they suffer hardship for a woman like this one.[158] Terrible is the likeness of her face to immortal goddesses.[159] Still, though she be such, let her go away in the ships, lest[160] she be left behind, a grief to us and our children.”[161] So they spoke: but Priam aloud called out to Helen:[162] “Come over where I am, dear child, and sit down beside me,[163] to look at your husband of time past, your friends and your people.[164] I am not blaming you: to me the gods are blameworthy[165] who drove upon me this sorrowful war against the Achaians.[166] So you could tell me the name of this man who is so tremendous;[167] who is this Achaian man of power and stature?[168] Though in truth there are others taller by a head than he is,[169] yet these eyes have never yet looked on a man so splendid[170] nor so lordly as this: such a man might well be royal.”[171] Helen, the shining among women, answered and spoke to him:[172] “Always to me, beloved father, you are feared and respected;[173] and I wish bitter death had been what I wanted, when I came hither[174] following your son, forsaking my chamber, my kinsmen,[175] my grown child, and the loveliness of girls my own age.[176] It did not happen that way: and now I am worn with weeping.[177] This now I will tell you in answer to the question you asked me.[178] That man is Atreus’ son Agamemnon, widely powerful,[179] at the same time a good king and a strong spearfighter,[180] once my kinsman, slut that I am. Did this ever happen?”[181] This she said, and the old man spoke again, wondering at him:[182] “O son of Atreus, blessed, child of fortune and favour,[183] many are these beneath your sway, these sons of the Achaians.[184] Once before this time I visited Phrygia of the vineyards.[185] There I looked on the Phrygian men with their swarming horses,[186] so many of them, the people of Otreus and godlike Mygdon,[187] whose camp was spread at that time along the banks of Sangarios:[188] and I myself, a helper in war, was marshalled among them[189] on that day when the Amazon women came, men’s equals.[190] Yet even they were not so many as these glancing-eyed Achaians.”[191] Next again the old man asked her, seeing Odysseus:[192] “Tell me of this one also, dear child; what man can he be,[193] shorter in truth by a head than Atreus’ son Agamemnon,[194] but broader, it would seem, in the chest and across the shoulders.[195] Now as his armour lies piled on the prospering earth, still he[196] ranges, like some ram, through the marshalled ranks of the fighters.[197] Truly, to some deep-fleeced ram would I liken him[198] who makes his way through the great mass of the shining sheep-flocks.”[199] Helen, the daughter descended of Zeus, spoke then in answer:[200] “This one is Laertes’ son, resourceful Odysseus,[201] who grew up in the country, rough though it be, of Ithaka,[202] to know every manner of shiftiness and crafty counsels.”[203] In his turn Antenor of the good counsel answered her:[204] “Surely this word you have spoken, my lady, can be no falsehood.[205] Once in the days before now brilliant Odysseus came here[206] with warlike Menelaos, and their embassy was for your sake.[207] To both of these I gave in my halls kind entertainment  p 34  [208] and I learned the natural way of both, and their close counsels.[209] Now when these were set before the Trojans assembled[210] and stood up, Menelaos was bigger by his broad shoulders[211] but Odysseus was the more lordly when both were seated.[212] Now before all when both of them spun their speech and their counsels,[213] Menelaos indeed spoke rapidly, in few words[214] but exceedingly lucid, since he was no long speaker[215] nor one who wasted his words though he was only a young man.[216] But when that other drove to his feet, resourceful Odysseus,[217] he would just stand and stare down, eyes fixed on the ground beneath him,[218] nor would he gesture with the staff backward and forward, but hold it[219] clutched hard in front of him, like any man who knows nothing.[220] Yes, you would call him a sullen man, and a fool likewise.[221] But when he let the great voice go from his chest, and the words came[222] drifting down like the winter snows, then no other mortal[223] man beside could stand up against Odysseus. Then we[224] wondered less beholding Odysseus’ outward appearance.”[225] Third in order, looking at Aias, the old man asked her:[226] “Who then is this other Achaian of power and stature[227] towering above the Argives by head and broad shoulders?”[228] Helen with the light robes and shining among women answered him:[229] “That one is gigantic Aias, wall of the Achaians,[230] and beyond him there is Idomeneus like a god standing[231] among the Kretans, and the lords of Krete are gathered about him.[232] Many a time warlike Menelaos would entertain him[233] in our own house when he came over from Krete. And I see them[234] all now, all the rest of the glancing-eyed Achaians,[235] all whom I know well by sight, whose names I could tell you,[236] yet nowhere can I see those two, the marshals of the people,[237] Kastor, breaker of horses, and the strong boxer, Polydeukes,[238] my own brothers, born with me of a single mother.[239] Perhaps these came not with the rest from Lakedaimon the lovely,[240] or else they did come here in their sea-wandering ships, yet[241] now they are reluctant to go with the men into battle[242] dreading the words of shame and all the reproach that is on me.”[243] So she spoke, but the teeming earth lay already upon them[244] away in Lakedaimon, the beloved land of their fathers.[245] Now through the town the heralds brought the symbols of oaths pledged,[246] two young rams, and cheerful wine, the yield of the tilled land[247] in a goatskin wine sack, while another carried the shining[248] mixing bowl (the herald Idaios) and the golden wine-cups.[249] Standing beside the aged man he spoke words to arouse him:[250] “Son of Laomedon, rise up: you are called by the chief men[251] of Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians[252] to come down into the plain that you may seal the oaths pledged.[253] For warlike Menelaos and Alexandros are to fight[254] with long spears against each other for the sake of the woman.[255] Let the woman go to the winner, and all the possessions.[256] Let the rest of them, cutting their oaths of faith and friendship,[257] dwell, we in Troy where the soil is rich, while those others return home[258] to horse-pasturing Argos and Achaia the land of fair women.”[259] So he spoke, and the old man shuddered, but called his companions[260] to yoke the horses to the car, and they promptly obeyed him.  p 35  [261] And Priam mounted into the car and gathered the reins back[262] as Antenor beside him stepped into the fair-wrought chariot.[263] Through the Skaian gates to the plain they steered the swift horses.[264] Now when these had come among the Trojans and Achaians,[265] they stepped down on the prospering earth from their car with horses[266] and made their way striding among the Achaians and Trojans.[267] On the other side rose up the lord of men, Agamemnon,[268] and the resourceful Odysseus rose up. Meanwhile the proud heralds[269] led up the victims for the gods’ oaths, and in a great wine-bowl[270] mixed the wine, and poured water over the hands of the princes.[271] Atreus’ son laid hands upon his work-knife, and drew it[272] from where it hung ever beside the mighty sheath of his war sword[273] and cut off hairs from the heads of the lambs; and the heralds thereafter[274] passed these about to all the princes of the Trojans and Achaians.[275] Atreus’ son uplifting his hands then prayed in a great voice:[276] “Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,[277] and Helois, you who see all things, who listen to all things,[278] earth, and rivers, and you who under the earth take vengeance[279] on dead men, whoever among them has sworn to falsehood,[280] you shall be witnesses, to guard the oaths of fidelity.[281] If it should be that Alexandros slays Menelaos,[282] let him keep Helen for himself, and all her possessions,[283] and we in our seafaring ships shall take our way homeward.[284] But if the fair-haired Menelaos kills Alexandros,[285] then let the Trojans give back Helen and all her possessions,[286] and pay also a price to the Argives which will be fitting,[287] which among people yet to come shall be as a standard.[288] Then if Priam and the sons of Priam are yet unwilling[289] after Alexandros has fallen to pay me the penalty,[290] I myself shall fight hereafter for the sake of the ransom,[291] here remaining, until I have won to the end of my quarrel.”[292] So he spoke, and with pitiless bronze he cut the lambs’ throats,[293] letting them fall gasping again to the ground, the life breath[294] going away, since the strength of the bronze had taken it from them.[295] Drawing the wine from the mixing bowls in the cups, they poured it[296] forth, and made their prayer to the gods who live everlasting.[297] And thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan:[298] “Zeus, exalted and mightiest, and you other immortals,[299] let those, whichever side they may be, who do wrong to the oaths sworn[300] first, let their brains be spilled on the ground as this wine is spilled now,[301] theirs and their sons’, and let their wives be the spoil of others.”[302] They spoke, but none of this would the son of Kronos accomplish.[303] Now among them spoke Priam descended of Dardanos also:[304] “Listen to me, you Trojans and you strong-greaved Achaians.[305] Now I am going away to windy Ilion, homeward,[306] since I cannot look with these eyes on the sight of my dear son[307] fighting against warlike Menelaos in single combat.[308] Zeus knows—maybe he knows—and the rest of the gods immortal[309] for which of the two death is appointed to end this matter.”[310] He spoke, a godlike man, and laid the lambs in the chariot,[311] and mounted into it himself, and pulled the reins backward.[312] Antenor beside him stepped up into the fair-wrought chariot.[313] These two took their way backward and made for Ilion.  p 36  [314] Hektor now, the son of Priam, and brilliant Odysseus[315] measured out the distance first, and thereafter picked up[316] two lots, and put them in a brazen helmet, and shook them,[317] to see which one of the two should be first to cast with his bronze spear,[318] and the people on each side held up their hands to the gods, and prayed[319] to them. Thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan:[320] “Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,[321] whichever man has made what has happened happen to both sides,[322] grant that he be killed and go down to the house of Hades.[323] Let the friendship and the sworn faith be true for the rest of us.”[324] So they spoke, and tall Hektor of the shining helm shook[325] the lots, looking backward, and at once Paris’ lot was outshaken.[326] All the rest sat down in their ranks on the ground, at the place where[327] the glittering armour of each was piled by his light-footed horses,[328] while one of them put about his shoulders his splendid armour,[329] brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen.[330] First he placed along his legs the fair greaves linked with[331] silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.[332] Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet[333] of Lykaon his brother since this fitted him also.[334] Across his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver,[335] a bronze sword, and above it the great shield, huge and heavy.[336] Over his powerful head he set the well-fashioned helmet[337] with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.[338] He took up a strong-shafted spear that fitted his hand’s grip.[339] In the same way warlike Menelaos put on his armour.[340] Now when these two were armed on either side of the battle,[341] they strode into the space between the Achaians and Trojans,[342] looking terror at each other; and amazement seized the beholders,[343] Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaians.[344] They took their stand in the measured space not far from each other[345] raging each at the other man and shaking their spearshafts.[346] First of the two Alexandros let go his spear far-shadowing[347] and struck the shield of Atreus’ son on its perfect circle[348] nor did the bronze point break its way through, but the spearhead bent back[349] in the strong shield. And after him Atreus’ son, Menelaos[350] was ready to let go the bronze spear, with a prayer to Zeus father:[351] “Zeus, lord, grant me to punish the man who first did me injury,[352] brilliant Alexandros, and beat him down under my hands’ strength[353] that any one of the men to come may shudder to think of[354] doing evil to a kindly host, who has given him friendship.”[355] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it[356] and struck the shield of Priam’s son on its perfect circle.[357] All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead[358] and smashed its way through the intricately worked corselet;[359] straight ahead by the flank the spearhead shore through his tunic,[360] yet he bent away to one side and avoided the dark death.[361] Drawing his sword with the silver nails, the son of Atreus[362] heaving backward struck at the horn of his helmet; the sword-blade[363] three times broken and four times broken fell from his hand’s grip.[364] Groaning, the son of Atreus lifted his eyes to the wide sky:[365] “Father Zeus, no God beside is more baleful than you are.  p 37  [366] Here I thought to punish Alexandros for his wickedness;[367] and now my sword is broken in my hands, and the spear flew vainly[368] out of my hands on the throw before, and I have not hit him.”[369] He spoke, and flashing forward laid hold of the horse-haired helmet[370] and spun him about, and dragged him away toward the strong-greaved Achaians,[371] for the broidered strap under the softness of his throat strangled Paris,[372] fastened under his chin to hold on the horned helmet.[373] Now he would have dragged him away and won glory forever[374] had not Aphrodite daughter of Zeus watched sharply.[375] She broke the chinstrap, made from the hide of a slaughtered bullock,[376] and the helmet came away empty in the heavy hand of Atreides.[377] The hero whirled the helmet about and sent it flying[378] among the strong-greaved Achaians, and his staunch companions retrieved it.[379] He turned and made again for his man, determined to kill him[380] with the bronze spear. But Aphrodite caught up Paris[381] easily, since she was divine, and wrapped him in a thick mist[382] and set him down again in his own perfumed bedchamber.[383] She then went away to summon Helen, and found her[384] on the high tower, with a cluster of Trojan women about her.[385] She laid her hand upon the robe immortal, and shook it,[386] and spoke to her, likening herself to an aged woman,[387] a wool-dresser who when she was living in Lakedaimon[388] made beautiful things out of wool, and loved her beyond all others.[389] Likening herself to this woman Aphrodite spoke to her:[390] “Come with me: Alexandros sends for you to come home to him.[391] He is in his chamber now, in the bed with its circled pattern,[392] shining in his raiment and his own beauty; you would not think[393] that he came from fighting against a man; you would think he was going[394] rather to a dance, or rested and had been dancing lately.”[395] So she spoke, and troubled the spirit in Helen’s bosom.[396] She, as she recognized the round, sweet throat of the goddess[397] and her desirable breasts and her eyes that were full of shining,[398] she wondered, and spoke a word and called her by name, thus:[399] “Strange divinity! Why are you still so stubborn to beguile me?[400] Will you carry me further yet somewhere among cities[401] fairly settled? In Phrygia or in lovely Maionia?[402] Is there some mortal man there also who is dear to you?[403] Is it because Menelaos has beaten great Alexandros[404] and wishes, hateful even as I am, to carry me homeward,[405] is it for this that you stand in your treachery now beside me?[406] Go yourself and sit beside him, abandon the gods’ way,[407] turn your feet back never again to the path of Olympos[408] but stay with him forever, and suffer for him, and look after him[409] until he makes you his wedded wife, or makes you his slave girl.[410] Not I. I am not going to him. It would be too shameful.[411] I will not serve his bed, since the Trojan women hereafter[412] would laugh at me, all, and my heart even now is confused with sorrows.”[413] Then in anger Aphrodite the shining spoke to her:[414] “Wretched girl, do not tease me lest in anger I forsake you[415] and grow to hate you as much as now I terribly love you,  p 38  [416] lest I encompass you in hard hate, caught between both sides,[417] Danaans and Trojans alike, and you wretchedly perish.”[418] So she spoke, and Helen daughter of Zeus was frightened[419] and went, shrouding herself about in the luminous spun robe,[420] silent, unseen by the Trojan women, and led by the goddess.[421] When they had come to Alexandros’ splendidly wrought house,[422] the rest of them, the handmaidens went speedily to their own work,[423] but she, shining among women, went to the high-vaulted bedchamber.[424] Aphrodite the sweetly laughing drew up an armchair,[425] carrying it, she, a goddess, and set it before Alexandros,[426] and Helen, daughter of Zeus of the aegis, took her place there[427] turning her eyes away, and spoke to her lord in derision:[428] “So you came back from fighting. Oh, how I wish you had died there[429] beaten down by the stronger man, who was once my husband.[430] There was a time before now you boasted that you were better[431] than warlike Menelaos, in spear and hand and your own strength.[432] Go forth now and challenge warlike Menelaos[433] once again to fight you in combat. But no: I advise you[434] rather to let it be, and fight no longer with fair-haired[435] Menelaos, strength against strength in single combat[436] recklessly. You might very well go down before his spear.”[437] Paris then in turn spoke to her thus and answered her:[438] “Lady, censure my heart no more in bitter reprovals.[439] This time Menelaos with Athene’s help has beaten me;[440] another time I shall beat him. We have gods on our side also.[441] Come, then, rather let us go to bed and turn to love-making.[442] Never before as now has passion enmeshed my senses,[443] not when I took you the first time from Lakedaimon the lovely[444] and caught you up and carried you away in seafaring vessels,[445] and lay with you in the bed of love on the island Kranae,[446] not even then, as now, did I love you and sweet desire seize me.”[447] Speaking, he led the way to the bed; and his wife went with him.[448] So these two were laid in the carven bed. But Atreides[449] ranged like a wild beast up and down the host, to discover[450] whether he could find anywhere godlike Alexandros.[451] Yet could none of the Trojans nor any renowned companion[452] show Alexandros then to warlike Menelaos.[453] These would not have hidden him for love, if any had seen him,[454] since he was hated among them all as dark death is hated.[455] Now among them spoke forth the lord of men Agamemnon:[456] “Listen to me, o Trojans, Dardanians and companions:[457] clearly the victory is with warlike Menelaos.[458] Do you therefore give back, with all her possessions, Helen[459] of Argos, and pay a price that shall be befitting,[460] which among people yet to come shall be as a standard.”[461] So spoke Atreus’ son, and the other Achaians applauded him.book four[1] Now the gods at the side of Zeus were sitting in council[2] over the golden floor, and among them the goddess Hebe  p 39  [3] poured them nectar as wine, while they in the golden drinking-cups[4] drank to each other, gazing down on the city of the Trojans.[5] Presently the son of Kronos was minded to anger[6] Hera, if he could, with words offensive, speaking to cross her:[7] “Two among the goddesses stand by Menelaos,[8] Hera of Argos, and Athene who stands by her people.[9] Yet see, here they are sitting apart, looking on at the fighting,[10] and take their pleasure. Meanwhile laughing Aphrodite forever[11] stands by her man and drives the spirits of death away from him.[12] Even now she has rescued him when he thought he would perish.[13] So, the victory now is with warlike Menelaos.[14] Let us consider then how these things shall be accomplished,[15] whether again to stir up grim warfare and the terrible[16] fighting, or cast down love and make them friends with each other.[17] If somehow this way could be sweet and pleasing to all of us,[18] the city of lord Priam might still be a place men dwell in,[19] and Menelaos could take away with him Helen of Argos.”[20] So he spoke; and Athene and Hera muttered, since they were[21] sitting close to each other, devising evil for the Trojans.[22] Still Athene stayed silent and said nothing, but only[23] sulked at Zeus her father, and savage anger took hold of her.[24] But the heart of Hera could not contain her anger, and she spoke forth:[25] “Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[26] How can you wish to make wasted and fruitless all this endeavour,[27] the sweat that I have sweated in toil, and my horses worn out[28] gathering my people, and bringing evil to Priam and his children.[29] Do it then; but not all the rest of us gods will approve you.”[30] Deeply troubled, Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:[31] “Dear lady, what can be all the great evils done to you[32] by Priam and the sons of Priam, that you are thus furious[33] forever to bring down the strong-founded city of Ilion?[34] If you could walk through the gates and through the towering ramparts[35] and eat Priam and the children of Priam raw, and the other[36] Trojans, then, then only might you glut at last your anger.[37] Do as you please then. Never let this quarrel hereafter[38] be between you and me a bitterness for both of us.[39] And put away in your thoughts this other thing that I tell you:[40] whenever I in turn am eager to lay waste some city,[41] as I please, one in which are dwelling men who are dear to you,[42] you shall not stand in the way of my anger, but let me do it,[43] since I was willing to grant you this with my heart unwilling.[44] For of all the cities beneath the sun and the starry heaven[45] dwelt in by men who live upon earth, there has never been one[46] honoured nearer to my heart than sacred Ilion[47] and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear.[48] Never yet has my altar gone without fair sacrifice,[49] the libation and the savour, since this is our portion of honour.”[50] Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered:[51] “Of all cities there are three that are dearest to my own heart:[52] Argos and Sparta and Mykenai of the wide ways. All these,[53] whenever they become hateful to your heart, sack utterly.[54] I will not stand up for these against you, nor yet begrudge you.  p 40  [55] Yet if even so I bear malice and would not have you destroy them,[56] in malice I will accomplish nothing, since you are far stronger.[57] Yet my labour also should not be let go unaccomplished;[58] I am likewise a god, and my race is even what yours is,[59] and I am first of the daughters of devious-devising Kronos,[60] both ways, since I am eldest born and am called your consort,[61] yours, and you in turn are lord over all the immortals.[62] Come then, in this thing let us both give way to each other,[63] I to you, you to me, and so the rest of the immortal[64] gods will follow. Now in speed give orders to Athene[65] to visit horrible war again on Achaians and Trojans,[66] and try to make it so that the Trojans are first offenders[67] to do injury against the oaths to the far-famed Achaians.”[68] She spoke, nor did the father of gods and men disobey her,[69] but immediately he spoke in winged words to Athene:[70] “Go now swiftly to the host of the Achaians and Trojans[71] and try to make it so that the Trojans are first offenders[72] to do injury against the oaths to the far-famed Achaians.”[73] Speaking so he stirred up Athene, who was eager before this,[74] and she went in a flash of speed down the pinnacles of Olympos.[75] As when the son of devious-devising Kronos casts down[76] a star, portent to sailors or to widespread armies of peoples[77] glittering, and thickly the sparks of fire break from it,[78] in such likeness Pallas Athene swept flashing earthward[79] and plunged between the two hosts; and amazement seized the beholders,[80] Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaians.[81] And thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the man next him:[82] “Surely again there will be evil war and terrible[83] fighting, or else now friendship is being set between both sides[84] by Zeus, who is appointed lord of the wars of mortals.”[85] Thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan.[86] She in the likeness of a man merged among the Trojans assembled,[87] Laodokos, Antenor’s son, a powerful spearman,[88] searching for godlike Pandaros, if she might somewhere come on him.[89] She found the son of Lykaon, a man blameless and powerful,[90] standing still, and about him were the ranks of strong, shield-armoured[91] people, who had followed him from the streams of Aisepos.[92] Speaking in winged words she stood beside him and spoke to him:[93] “Wise son of Lykaon, would you now let me persuade you?[94] So you might dare send a flying arrow against Menelaos[95] and win you glory and gratitude in the sight of all Trojans,[96] particularly beyond all else with prince Alexandros.[97] Beyond all beside you would carry away glorious gifts from him,[98] were he to see warlike Menelaos, the son of Atreus,[99] struck down by your arrow, and laid on the sorrowful corpse-fire.[100] Come then, let go an arrow against haughty Menelaos,[101] but make your prayer to Apollo the light-born, the glorious archer,[102] that you will accomplish a grand sacrifice of lambs first born[103] when you come home again to the city of sacred Zeleia.”[104] So spoke Athene, and persuaded the fool’s heart in him.[105] Straightway he unwrapped his bow, of the polished horn from[106] a running wild goat he himself had shot in the chest once,  p 41  [107] lying in wait for the goat in a covert as it stepped down[108] from the rock, and hit it in the chest so it sprawled on the boulders.[109] The horns that grew from the goat’s head were sixteen palms’ length.[110] A bowyer working on the horn then bound them together,[111] smoothing them to a fair surface, and put on a golden string hook.[112] Pandaros strung his bow and put it in position, bracing it[113] against the ground, and his brave friends held their shields in front of him[114] for fear the warlike sons of the Achaians might rise up and rush him[115] before he had struck warlike Menelaos, the son of Atreus.[116] He stripped away the lid of the quiver, and took out an arrow[117] feathered, and never shot before, transmitter of dark pain.[118] Swiftly he arranged the bitter arrow along the bowstring,[119] and made his prayer to Apollo the light-born, the glorious archer,[120] that he would accomplish a grand sacrifice of lambs first born[121] when he came home again to the city of sacred Zeleia.[122] He drew, holding at once the grooves and the ox-hide bowstring[123] and brought the string against his nipple, iron to the bowstave.[124] But when he had pulled the great weapon till it made a circle,[125] the bow groaned, and the string sang high, and the arrow, sharp-pointed,[126] leapt away, furious, to fly through the throng before it.[127] Still the blessed gods immortal did not forget you,[128] Menelaos, and first among them Zeus’ daughter, the spoiler,[129] who standing in front of you fended aside the tearing arrow.[130] She brushed it away from his skin as lightly as when a mother[131] brushes a fly away from her child who is lying in sweet sleep,[132] steering herself the arrow’s course straight to where the golden[133] belt buckles joined and the halves of his corselet were fitted together.[134] The bitter arrow was driven against the joining of the war belt[135] and passed clean through the war belt elaborately woven;[136] into the elaborately wrought corselet the shaft was driven[137] and the guard which he wore to protect his skin and keep the spears off,[138] which guarded him best, yet the arrow plunged even through this also[139] and with the very tip of its point it grazed the man’s skin[140] and straightway from the cut there gushed a cloud of dark blood.[141] As when some Maionian woman or Karian with purple[142] colours ivory, to make it a cheek piece for horses;[143] it lies away in an inner room, and many a rider[144] longs to have it, but it is laid up to be a king’s treasure,[145] two things, to be the beauty of the horse, the pride of the horseman:[146] so, Menelaos, your shapely thighs were stained with the colour[147] of blood, and your legs also and the ankles beneath them.[148] Agamemnon the lord of men was taken with shuddering[149] fear as he saw how from the cut the dark blood trickled downward,[150] and Menelaos the warlike himself shuddered in terror;[151] but when he saw the binding strings and the hooked barbs outside[152] the wound, his spirit was gathered again back into him. Agamemnon[153] the powerful spoke to them, groaning heavily, and by the hand held[154] Menelaos, while their companions were mourning beside them:[155] “Dear brother, it was your death I sealed in the oaths of friendship,[156] setting you alone before the Achaians to fight with the Trojans.[157] So, the Trojans have struck you down and trampled on the oaths sworn.[158] Still the oaths and the blood of the lambs shall not be called vain,  p 42  [159] the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted.[160] If the Olympian at once has not finished this matter,[161] late will he bring it to pass, and they must pay a great penalty,[162] with their own heads, and with their women, and with their children.[163] For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it.[164] There will come a day when sacred Ilion shall perish,[165] and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear,[166] and Zeus son of Kronos who sits on high, the sky-dwelling,[167] himself shall shake the gloom of his aegis over all of them[168] in anger for this deception. All this shall not go unaccomplished.[169] But I shall suffer a terrible grief for you, Menelaos,[170] if you die and fill out the destiny of your lifetime.[171] And I must return a thing of reproach to Argos the thirsty,[172] for now at once the Achaians will remember the land of their fathers;[173] and thus we would leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen[174] of Argos, to glory over, while the bones of you rot in the ploughland[175] as you lie dead in Troy, on a venture that went unaccomplished.[176] And thus shall some Trojan speak in the proud show of his manhood,[177] leaping lightly as he speaks on the tomb of great Menelaos:[178] ‘Might Agamemnon accomplish his anger thus against all his[179] enemies, as now he led here in vain a host of Achaians[180] and has gone home again to the beloved land of his fathers[181] with ships empty, and leaving behind him brave Menelaos.’[182] Thus shall a man speak: then let the wide earth open to take me.”[183] Then in encouragement fair-haired Menelaos spoke to him:[184] “Do not fear, nor yet make afraid the Achaian people.[185] The sharp arrow is not stuck in a mortal place, but the shining[186] war belt turned it aside from its course, and the flap beneath it[187] with my guard of armour that bronze-smiths wrought carefully for me.”[188] Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:[189] “May it only be as you say, o Menelaos, dear brother![190] But the physician will handle the wound and apply over it[191] healing salves, by which he can put an end to the black pains.”[192] He spoke, and addressed Talthybios, his sacred herald:[193] “Talthybios, with all speed go call hither Machaon,[194] a man who is son of Asklepios and a blameless physician,[195] so that he may look at Menelaos, the warlike son of[196] Atreus, whom someone skilled in the bow’s use shot with an arrow,[197] Trojan or Lykian: glory to him, but to us a sorrow.”[198] He spoke, and the herald heard and did not disobey him,[199] but went on his way among the host of bronze-armoured Achaians[200] looking about for the warrior Machaon; and saw him[201] standing still, and about him the strong ranks of shield-bearing[202] people, who had come with him from horse-pasturing Trikka.[203] He came and stood close beside him and addressed him in winged words:[204] “Rise up, son of Asklepios; powerful Agamemnon calls you,[205] so that you may look at warlike Menelaos, the Achaians’[206] leader, whom someone skilled in the bow’s use shot with an arrow,[207] Trojan or Lykian: glory to him, but to us a sorrow.”[208] So he spoke, and stirred up the spirit within Machaon.[209] They went through the crowd along the widespread host of the Achaians.[210] But when they had come to the place where fair-haired Menelaos  p 43  [211] had been hit, where all the great men were gathered about him[212] in a circle, and he stood in the midst of them, a man godlike,[213] straightway he pulled the arrow forth from the joining of the war belt,[214] and as it was pulled out the sharp barbs were broken backwards.[215] He slipped open the war belt then and the flap beneath it[216] with the guard of armour that bronze-smiths wrought carefully for him.[217] But when he saw the wound where the bitter arrow was driven,[218] he sucked the blood and in skill laid healing medicines on it[219] that Cheiron in friendship long ago had given his father.[220] While they were working over Menelaos of the great war cry[221] all this time came on the ranks of the armoured Trojans.[222] The Achaians again put on their armour, and remembered their warcraft.[223] Then you would not have seen brilliant Agamemnon asleep nor[224] skulking aside, nor in any way a reluctant fighter,[225] but driving eagerly toward the fighting where men win glory.[226] He left aside his chariot gleaming with bronze, and his horses,[227] and these, breathing hard, were held aside by a henchman,[228] Eurymedon, born to Ptolemaios, the son of Peiraios.[229] Agamemnon told him to keep them well in the hand, till the time came[230] when weariness might take hold of his limbs, through marshalling so many.[231] Then he, on foot as he was, ranged through the ranks of his fighters.[232] Those of the fast-mounted Danaans he found eager, he would[233] stand beside these and urge them harder on with words spoken:[234] “Argives, do not let go now of this furious valour.[235] Zeus the father shall not be one to give aid to liars,[236] but these, who were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn,[237] vultures shall feed upon the delicate skin of their bodies,[238] while we lead away their beloved wives and innocent[239] children, in our ships, after we have stormed their citadel.”[240] Any he might see hanging back from the hateful conflict[241] these in words of anger he would reproach very bitterly:[242] “Argives, you arrow-fighters, have you no shame, you abuses?[243] Why are you simply standing there bewildered, like young deer[244] who after they are tired from running through a great meadow[245] stand there still, and there is no heart of courage within them?[246] Thus are you standing still bewildered and are not fighting.[247] Or are you waiting for the Trojans to come close, where the strong-sterned[248] ships have been hauled up along the strand of the grey sea,[249] so you may know if Kronos’ son will hold his hand over you?”[250] Thus he ranged through the ranks of his men and set them in order.[251] On his way through the thronging men he came to the Kretans[252] who about valiant Idomeneus were arming for battle.[253] Idomeneus, like a boar in his strength, stood among the champions[254] while Meriones still urged along the last battalions.[255] Agamemnon the lord of men was glad as he looked at them[256] and in words of graciousness at once spoke to Idomeneus:[257] “I honour you, Idomeneus, beyond the fast-mounted[258] Danaans whether in battle, or in any action whatever,[259] whether it be at the feast, when the great men of the Argives[260] blend in the mixing bowl the gleaming wine of the princes.[261] Even though all the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians[262] drink out their portion, still your cup stands filled forever  p 44  [263] even as mine, for you to drink when the pleasure takes you.[264] Rise up then to battle, be such as you claimed in time past.”[265] Then in turn Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him:[266] “Son of Atreus, I will in truth be a staunch companion[267] in arms, as first I promised you and bent my head to it.[268] Rouse up rather the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians[269] so that we may fight in all speed, since the Trojans have broken[270] their oaths; a thing that shall be death and sorrow hereafter[271] to them, since they were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn.”[272] So he spoke, and Atreides, cheerful at heart, went onward.[273] On his way through the thronging men he came to the Aiantes.[274] These were armed, and about them went a cloud of foot-soldiers.[275] As from his watching place a goatherd watches a cloud move[276] on its way over the sea before the drive of the west wind;[277] far away though he be he watches it, blacker than pitch is,[278] moving across the sea and piling the storm before it,[279] and as he sees it he shivers and drives his flocks to a cavern;[280] so about the two Aiantes moved the battalions,[281] close-compacted of strong and god-supported young fighters,[282] black, and jagged with spear and shield, to the terror of battle.[283] Agamemnon the lord of men was glad when he looked at them,[284] and he spoke aloud to them and addressed them in winged words:[285] “Aiantes, o leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives,[286] to you two I give no orders; it would not become me[287] to speed you, now that yourselves drive your people on to fight strongly.[288] Father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, if only[289] such a spirit were in the hearts of all of my people.[290] Then perhaps the city of lord Priam would be bent[291] underneath our hands, captured and utterly taken.”[292] So he spoke, and left them there, and went among others.[293] There he came upon Nestor, the lucid speaker of Pylos,[294] setting in order his own companions and urging them to battle,[295] tall Pelagon with those about him, Alastor and Chromios,[296] Haimon the powerful, and Bias, shepherd of the people.[297] First he ranged the mounted men with their horses and chariots[298] and stationed the brave and numerous foot-soldiers behind them[299] to be the bastion of battle, and drove the cowards to the centre[300] so that a man might be forced to fight even though unwilling.[301] First he gave orders to the drivers of horses, and warned them[302] to hold their horses in check and not be fouled in the multitude:[303] “Let no man in the pride of his horsemanship and his manhood[304] dare to fight alone with the Trojans in front of the rest of us,[305] neither let him give ground, since that way you will be weaker.[306] When a man from his own car encounters the enemy chariots[307] let him stab with his spear, since this is the stronger fighting.[308] So the men before your time sacked tower and city,[309] keeping a spirit like this in their hearts, and like this their purpose.”[310] Thus the old man wise in fighting from of old encouraged them.[311] Agamemnon the lord of men was glad when he looked at him[312] and he spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[313] “Aged sir, if only, as the spirit is in your bosom,[314] so might your knees be also and the strength stay steady within you;  p 45  [315] but age weakens you which comes to all; if only some other[316] of the fighters had your age and you were one of the young men!”[317] Nestor the Gerenian horseman spoke and answered him:[318] “Son of Atreus, so would I also wish to be that[319] man I was, when I cut down brilliant Ereuthalion.[320] But the gods give to mortals not everything at the same time;[321] if I was a young man then, now in turn old age is upon me.[322] Yet even so I shall be among the riders, and command them[323] with word and counsel; such is the privilege of the old men.[324] The young spearmen shall do the spear-fighting, those who are born[325] of a generation later than mine, who trust in their own strength.”[326] So he spoke, and Atreides, cheerful at heart, went onward.[327] He came on the son of Peteos, Menestheus, driver of horses,[328] standing still, and about him the Athenians, urgent for battle.[329] Next to these resourceful Odysseus had taken position,[330] and beside him the Kephallenian ranks, no weak ones,[331] were standing, since the men had not heard the clamour of battle[332] but even now fresh set in motion moved the battalions[333] of Achaians and Trojans, breakers of horses; so these standing[334] waited, until some other mass of Achaians advancing[335] might crash against the Trojans, and the battle be opened.[336] Seeing these the lord of men Agamemnon scolded them[337] and spoke aloud to them and addressed them in winged words, saying:[338] “Son of Peteos, the king supported of God: and you, too,[339] you with your mind forever on profit and your ways of treachery,[340] why do you stand here skulking aside, and wait for the others?[341] For you two it is becoming to stand among the foremost[342] fighters, and endure your share of the blaze of battle;[343] since indeed you two are first to hear of the feasting[344] whenever we Achaians make ready a feast of the princes.[345] There is your pleasure to eat the roast flesh, to drink[346] as much as you please the cups of the wine that is sweet as honey.[347] Now, though, you would be pleased to look on though ten battalions[348] of Achaians were to fight with the pitiless bronze before you.”[349] Then looking at him darkly resourceful Odysseus spoke to him:[350] “What is this word that broke through the fence of your teeth, Atreides?[351] How can you say that, when we Achaians waken the bitter[352] war god on Trojans, breakers of horses, I hang back from[353] fighting? Only watch, if you care to and if it concerns you,[354] the very father of Telemachos locked with the champion[355] Trojans, breakers of horses. Your talk is wind, and no meaning.”[356] Powerful Agamemnon in turn answered him, laughing,[357] seeing that he was angered and taking back the word spoken:[358] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:[359] I must not be niggling with you, nor yet give you orders,[360] since I know how the spirit in your secret heart knows[361] ideas of kindness only; for what you think is what I think.[362] Come now, I will make it good hereafter, if anything evil[363] has been said; let the gods make all this come to nothing.”[364] So he spoke, and left him there, and went among others.[365] He came on the son of Tydeus, high-spirited Diomedes,[366] standing among the compacted chariots and by the horses,  p 46  [367] and Kapaneus’ son, Sthenelos, was standing beside him. At sight[368] of Diomedes the lord of men Agamemnon scolded him[369] and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words, saying:[370] “Ah me, son of Tydeus, that daring breaker of horses,[371] why are you skulking and spying out the outworks of battle?[372] Such was never Tydeus’ way, to lurk in the background,[373] but to fight the enemy far ahead of his own companions.[374] So they say who had seen him at work, since I never saw nor[375] encountered him ever; but they say he surpassed all others.[376] Once on a time he came, but not in war, to Mykenai[377] with godlike Polyneikes, a guest and a friend, assembling[378] people, since these were attacking the sacred bastions of Thebe,[379] and much they entreated us to grant him renowned companions.[380] And our men wished to give them and were assenting to what they asked for[381] but Zeus turned them back, showing forth portents that crossed them.[382] Now as these went forward and were well on their way, and came[383] to the river Asopos, and the meadows of grass and the deep rushes,[384] from there the Achaians sent Tydeus ahead with a message.[385] He went then and came on the Kadmeians in their numbers[386] feasting all about the house of mighty Eteokles.[387] There, stranger though he was, the driver of horses, Tydeus,[388] was not frightened, alone among so many Kadmeians,[389] but dared them to try their strength with him, and bested all of them[390] easily, such might did Pallas Athene give him.[391] The Kadmeians who lash their horses, in anger compacted[392] an ambuscade of guile on his way home, assembling together[393] fifty fighting men, and for these there were two leaders,[394] Maion, Haimon’s son, in the likeness of the immortals,[395] with the son of Autophonos, Polyphontes stubborn in battle.[396] On these men Tydeus let loose a fate that was shameful.[397] He killed them all, except that he let one man get home again,[398] letting Maion go in obedience to the god’s signs.[399] This was Tydeus, the Aitolian; yet he was father[400] to a son worse than himself at fighting, better in conclave.”[401] So he spoke, and strong Diomedes gave no answer[402] in awe before the majesty of the king’s rebuking;[403] but the son of Kapaneus the glorious answered him, saying:[404] “Son of Atreus, do not lie when you know the plain truth.[405] We two claim we are better men by far than our fathers.[406] We did storm the seven-gated foundation of Thebe[407] though we led fewer people beneath a wall that was stronger.[408] We obeyed the signs of the gods and the help Zeus gave us,[409] while those others died of their own headlong stupidity.[410] Therefore, never liken our fathers to us in honour.”[411] Then looking at him darkly strong Diomedes spoke to him:[412] “Friend, stay quiet rather and do as I tell you; I will[413] find no fault with Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[414] for stirring thus into battle the strong-greaved Achaians;[415] this will be his glory to come, if ever the Achaians[416] cut down the men of Troy and capture sacred Ilion.[417] If the Achaians are slain, then his will be the great sorrow.[418] Come, let you and me remember our fighting courage.”  p 47  [419] He spoke and leapt in all his gear to the ground from the chariot,[420] and the bronze armour girt to the chest of the king clashed terribly[421] as he sprang. Fear would have gripped even a man stout-hearted.[422] As when along the thundering beach the surf of the sea strikes[423] beat upon beat as the west wind drives it onward; far out[424] cresting first on the open water, it drives thereafter[425] to smash roaring along the dry land, and against the rock jut[426] bending breaks itself into crests spewing back the salt wash;[427] so thronged beat upon beat the Danaans’ close battalions[428] steadily into battle, with each of the lords commanding[429] his own men; and these went silently, you would not think[430] all these people with voices kept in their chests were marching;[431] silently, in fear of their commanders; and upon all[432] glittered as they marched the shining armour they carried.[433] But the Trojans, as sheep in a man of possessions’ steading[434] stand in their myriads waiting to be drained of their white milk[435] and bleat interminably as they hear the voice of their lambs, so[436] the crying of the Trojans went up through the wide army.[437] Since there was no speech nor language common to all of them[438] but their talk was mixed, who were called there from many far places.[439] Ares drove these on, and the Achaians grey-eyed Athene,[440] and Terror drove them and Fear, and Hate whose wrath is relentless.[441] she the sister and companion of murderous Ares,[442] she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter[443] grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven.[444] She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides[445] as she walked through the onslaught making men’s pain heavier.[446] Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,[447] they dashed their shields together and their spears, and the strength[448] of armoured men in bronze, and the shields massive in the middle[449] clashed against each other, and the sound grew huge of the fighting.[450] There the screaming and the shouts of triumph rose up together[451] of men killing and men killed, and the ground ran blood.[452] As when rivers in winter spate running down from the mountains[453] throw together at the meeting of streams the weight of their water[454] out of the great springs behind in the hollow stream-bed,[455] and far away in the mountains the shepherd hears their thunder;[456] such, from the coming together of men, was the shock and the shouting.[457] Antilochos was first to kill a chief man of the Trojans,[458] valiant among the champions, Thalysias’ son, Echepolos.[459] Throwing first, he struck the horn of the horse-haired helmet,[460] and the bronze spearpoint fixed in his forehead and drove inward[461] through the bone; and a mist of darkness clouded both eyes[462] and he fell as a tower falls in the strong encounter.[463] As he dropped, Elephenor the powerful caught him by the feet,[464] Chalkodon’s son, and lord of the great-hearted Abantes,[465] and dragged him away from under the missiles, striving in all speed[466] to strip the armour from him, yet his outrush went short-lived.[467] For as he hauled the corpse high-hearted Agenor, marking[468] the ribs that showed bare under the shield as he bent over,[469] stabbed with the bronze-pointed spear and unstrung his sinews.[470] So the spirit left him and over his body was fought out  p 48  [471] weary work by Trojans and Achaians, who like wolves[472] sprang upon one another, with man against man in the onfall.[473] There Telamonian Aias struck down the son of Anthemion[474] Simoeisios in his stripling’s beauty, whom once his mother[475] descending from Ida bore beside the banks of Simoeis[476] when she had followed her father and mother to tend the sheepflocks.[477] Therefore they called him Simoeisios; but he could not[478] render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,[479] beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Aias,[480] who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple[481] of the right breast, and the bronze spearhead drove clean through the shoulder.[482] He dropped then to the ground in the dust, like some black poplar,[483] which in the land low-lying about a great marsh grows[484] smooth trimmed yet with branches growing at the uttermost tree-top:[485] one whom a man, a maker of chariots, fells with the shining[486] iron, to bend it into a wheel for a fine-wrought chariot,[487] and the tree lies hardening by the banks of a river.[488] Such was Anthemion’s son Simoeisios, whom illustrious[489] Aias killed. Now Antiphos of the shining corselet,[490] Priam’s son, made a cast at him in the crowd with the sharp spear[491] but missed Aias and struck Leukos, a brave companion[492] of Odysseus, in the groin, as he dragged a corpse off,[493] so that the body dropped from his hand as he fell above it.[494] For his killing Odysseus was stirred to terrible anger[495] and he strode out among the champions, helmed in bright bronze,[496] and stood close to the enemy hefting the shining javelin,[497] glaring round about him; and the Trojans gave way in the face[498] of the man throwing with the spear. And he made no vain cast,[499] but struck down Demokoön, a son of Priam, a bastard,[500] who came over from Abydos, and left his fast-running horses.[501] Odysseus struck him with the spear, in anger for his companion,[502] in the temple, and the bronze spearhead drove through the other[503] temple also, so that a mist of darkness clouded both eyes.[504] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.[505] The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor,[506] and the Argives gave a great cry, and dragged back the bodies,[507] and drove their way far forward, but now Apollo watching[508] from high Pergamos was angered, and called aloud to the Trojans:[509] “Rise up, Trojans, breakers of horses, bend not from battle[510] with these Argives. Surely their skin is not stone, not iron[511] to stand up under the tearing edge of the bronze as it strikes them.[512] No, nor is Achilleus the child of lovely-haired Thetis[513] fighting, but beside the ship mulls his heartsore anger.”[514] So called the fearful god from the citadel, while Zeus’ daughter[515] Tritogeneia, goddess most high, drove on the Achaians,[516] any of them she saw hanging back as she strode through the battle.[517] Now his doom caught fast Amaryngkeus’ son Diores,[518] who with a jagged boulder was smitten beside the ankle[519] in the right shin, and a lord of the Thracian warriors threw it,[520] Peiros, son of Imbrasos, who had journeyed from Ainos.[521] The pitiless stone smashed utterly the tendons on both sides  p 49  [522] with the bones, and he was hurled into the dust backwards[523] reaching out both hands to his own beloved companions,[524] gasping life out; the stone’s thrower ran up beside him,[525] Peiros, and stabbed with his spear next the navel, and all his guts poured[526] out on the ground, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.[527] Thoas the Aitolian hit Peiros as he ran backward[528] with the spear in the chest above the nipple, and the bronze point fixed[529] in the lung, and Thoas standing close dragged out the heavy[530] spear from his chest, and drawing his sharp sword struck him[531] in the middle of the belly, and so took the life from him,[532] yet did not strip his armour, for his companions about him[533] stood, Thracians with hair grown at the top, gripping their long spears,[534] and though he was a mighty man and a strong and proud one[535] thrust him from them so that he gave ground backward, staggering.[536] So in the dust these two lay sprawled beside one another,[537] lords, the one of the Thracians, the other of the bronze-armoured[538] Epeians; and many others beside were killed all about them.[539] There no more could a man who was in that work make light of it,[540] one who still unhit and still unstabbed by the sharp bronze[541] spun in the midst of that fighting, with Pallas Athene’s hold on[542] his hand guiding him, driving back the volleying spears thrown.[543] For on that day many men of the Achaians and Trojans[544] lay sprawled in the dust face downward beside one another.book five[1] There to Tydeus’ son Diomedes Pallas Athene[2] granted strength and daring, that he might be conspicuous[3] among all the Argives and win the glory of valour.[4] She made weariless fire blaze from his shield and helmet[5] like that star of the waning summer who beyond all stars[6] rises bathed in the ocean stream to glitter in brilliance.[7] Such was the fire she made blaze from his head and his shoulders[8] and urged him into the middle fighting, where most were struggling.[9] There was a man of the Trojans, Dares, blameless and bountiful,[10] priest consecrated to Hephaistos, and he had two sons,[11] Phegeus and Idaios, well skilled both in all fighting.[12] These two breaking from the ranks of the others charged against him[13] riding their chariot as Diomedes came on, dismounted.[14] Now as in their advance these had come close to each other[15] first of the two Phegeus let go his spear far-shadowing.[16] Over the left shoulder of Tydeus’ son passed the pointed[17] spear, nor struck his body, and Diomedes thereafter[18] threw with the bronze, and the weapon cast from his hand flew not vain[19] but struck the chest between the nipples and hurled him from behind[20] his horses. And Idaios leaping left the fair-wrought chariot[21] nor had he the courage to stand over his stricken brother.[22] Even so he could not have escaped the black death-spirit[23] but Hephaistos caught him away and rescued him, shrouded in darkness,[24] that the aged man might not be left altogether desolate.[25] But the son of high-hearted Tydeus drove off the horses  p 50  [26] and gave them to his company to lead back to the hollow vessels.[27] Now as the high-hearted Trojans watched the two sons of Dares,[28] one running away, and one cut down by the side of his chariot,[29] the anger in all of them was stirred. But grey-eyed Athene[30] took violent Ares by the hand, and in words she spoke to him:[31] “Ares, Ares, manslaughtering, blood-stained, stormer of strong walls,[32] shall we not leave the Trojans and Achaians to struggle[33] after whatever way Zeus father grants glory to either,[34] while we two give ground together and avoid Zeus’ anger?”[35] So she spoke, and led violent Ares out of the fighting[36] and afterwards caused him to sit down by the sands of Skamandros[37] while the Danaans bent the Trojans back, and each of the princes[38] killed his man. And first the lord of men Agamemnon[39] hurled tall Odios, lord of the Halizones, from his chariot.[40] For in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed[41] between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.[42] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.[43] Idomeneus killed Phaistos the son of Maionian Boros,[44] who had come out of Tarne with the deep soil. Idomeneus[45] the spear-renowned stabbed this man just as he was mounting[46] behind his horses, with the long spear driven in the right shoulder.[47] He dropped from the chariot, and the hateful darkness took hold of him.[48] The henchmen of Idomeneus stripped the armour from Phaistos,[49] while Menelaos son of Atreus killed with the sharp spear[50] Strophios’ son, a man of wisdom in the chase, Skamandrios,[51] the fine huntsman of beasts. Artemis herself had taught him[52] to strike down every wild thing that grows in the mountain forest.[53] Yet Artemis of the showering arrows could not now help him,[54] no, nor the long spearcasts in which he had been pre-eminent,[55] but Menelaos the spear-famed, son of Atreus, stabbed him,[56] as he fled away before him, in the back with a spear thrust[57] between the shoulders and driven through to the chest beyond it.[58] He dropped forward on his face and his armour clattered upon him.[59] Meriones in turn killed Phereklos, son of Harmonides,[60] the smith, who understood how to make with his hand all intricate[61] things, since above all others Pallas Athene had loved him.[62] He it was who had built for Alexandros the balanced[63] ships, the beginning of the evil, fatal to the other[64] Trojans, and to him, since he knew nothing of the gods’ plans.[65] This man Meriones pursued and overtaking him[66] struck in the right buttock, and the spearhead drove straight[67] on and passing under the bone went into the bladder.[68] He dropped, screaming, to his knees, and death was a mist about him.[69] Meges in turn killed Pedaios, the son of Antenor,[70] who, bastard though he was, was nursed by lovely Theano[71] with close care, as for her own children, to pleasure her husband.[72] Now the son of Phyleus, the spear-famed, closing upon him[73] struck him with the sharp spear behind the head at the tendon,[74] and straight on through the teeth and under the tongue cut the bronze blade,[75] and he dropped in the dust gripping in his teeth the cold bronze.[76] Eurypylos, Euaimon’s son, killed brilliant Hypsenor,[77] son of high-hearted Dolopion, he who was made Skamandros’  p 51  [78] priest, and was honoured about the countryside as a god is.[79] This man Eurypylos, the shining son of Euaimon,[80] running in chase as he fled before him struck in the shoulder[81] with a blow swept from the sword and cut the arm’s weight from him,[82] so that the arm dropped bleeding to the ground, and the red death[83] and destiny the powerful took hold of both eyes.[84] So they went at their work all about the strong encounter;[85] but you could not have told on which side Tydeus’ son was fighting,[86] whether he were one with the Trojans or with the Achaians,[87] since he went storming up the plain like a winter-swollen[88] river in spate that scatters the dikes in its running current,[89] one that the strong-compacted dikes can contain no longer,[90] neither the mounded banks of the blossoming vineyards hold it[91] rising suddenly as Zeus’ rain makes heavy the water[92] and many lovely works of the young men crumble beneath it.[93] Like these the massed battalions of the Trojans were scattered[94] by Tydeus’ son, and many as they were could not stand against him.[95] Now as the shining son of Lykaon, Pandaros, watched him[96] storming up the plain scattering the battalions before him,[97] at once he strained the bent bow against the son of Tydeus,[98] and shot, and hit him as he charged forward, in the right shoulder[99] at the hollow of the corselet; and the bitter arrow went straight through[100] holding clean to its way, and the corselet was all blood-spattered.[101] And the shining son of Lykaon cried aloud in a great voice:[102] “Rise up, Trojans, o high-hearted, lashers of horses.[103] Now the best of the Achaians is hit, and I think that he will not[104] long hold up under the strong arrow, if truly Apollo[105] lord and son of Zeus stirred me to come forth from Lykia.”[106] So he spoke, vaunting, but the swift arrow had not broken him,[107] only he drew back again to his chariot and horses,[108] and stood there, speaking to Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus:[109] “Come, dear friend, son of Kapaneus, step down from the chariot,[110] so that you may pull out from my shoulder this bitter arrow.”[111] So he spoke, and Sthenelos sprang to the ground from his chariot[112] and standing beside him pulled the sharp arrow clean through his shoulder[113] and the blood shot up spurting through the delicate tunic.[114] Now Diomedes of the great war cry spoke aloud, praying:[115] “Hear me now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis:[116] if ever before in kindliness you stood by my father[117] through the terror of fighting, be my friend now also, Athene;[118] grant me that I may kill this man and come within spearcast,[119] who shot me before I could see him, and now boasts over me, saying[120] I cannot live to look much longer on the shining sunlight.”[121] So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.[122] She made his limbs light again, and his feet, and his hands above them,[123] and standing close beside him she spoke and addressed him in winged words:[124] “Be of good courage now, Diomedes, to fight with the Trojans,[125] since I have put inside your chest the strength of your father[126] untremulous, such as the horseman Tydeus of the great shield[127] had; I have taken away the mist from your eyes, that before now[128] was there, so that you may well recognize the god and the mortal.[129] Therefore now, if a god making trial of you comes hither  p 52  [130] do you not do battle head on with the gods immortal,[131] not with the rest; but only if Aphrodite, Zeus’s daughter,[132] comes to the fighting, her at least you may stab with the sharp bronze.”[133] She spoke thus, grey-eyed Athene, and went, while Tydeus’[134] son closed once again with the champions, taking his place there;[135] raging as he had been before to fight with the Trojans,[136] now the strong rage tripled took hold of him, as of a lion[137] whom the shepherd among his fleecy flocks in the wild lands[138] grazed as he leapt the fence of the fold, but has not killed him,[139] but only stirred up the lion’s strength, and can no more fight him[140] off, but hides in the steading, and the frightened sheep are forsaken,[141] and these are piled pell-mell on each other in heaps, while the lion[142] raging still leaps out again over the fence of the deep yard;[143] such was the rage of strong Diomedes as he closed with the Trojans.[144] Next he killed Astynoös and Hypeiron, shepherd of the people,[145] striking one with the bronze-heeled spear above the nipple,[146] and cutting the other beside the shoulder through the collar-bone[147] with the great sword, so that neck and back were hewn free of the shoulder.[148] He left these men, and went on after Polyidos and Abas,[149] sons of the aged dream-interpreter, Eurydamas;[150] yet for these two as they went forth the old man did not answer[151] their dreams, but Diomedes the powerful slew them. Now he[152] went after the two sons of Phainops, Xanthos and Thoön,[153] full grown both, but Phainops was stricken in sorrowful old age[154] nor could breed another son to leave among his possessions.[155] There he killed these two and took away the dear life from them[156] both, leaving to their father lamentation and sorrowful[157] affliction, since he was not to welcome them home from the fighting[158] alive still; and remoter kinsmen shared his possessions.[159] Next he killed two children of Dardanian Priam[160] who were in a single chariot, Echemmon and Chromios.[161] As among cattle a lion leaps on the neck of an ox or[162] heifer, that grazes among the wooded places, and breaks it,[163] so the son of Tydeus hurled both from their horses[164] hatefully, in spite of their struggles, then stripped their armour[165] and gave the horses to his company to drive to their vessels.[166] Now as Aineias saw him wrecking the ranks of warriors[167] he went on his way through the fighting and the spears’ confusion[168] looking to see if he could find Pandaros the godlike;[169] and he came upon the strong and blameless son of Lykaon.[170] He stood before him face to face and spoke a word to him:[171] “Pandaros, where now are your bow and your feathered arrows;[172] where your fame, in which no man here dare contend with you[173] nor can any man in Lykia claim he is better?[174] Come then, hold up your hands to Zeus, and let go an arrow[175] at this strong man, whoever he be, who does so much evil[176] to the Trojans, since many and great are those whose knees he has broken.[177] Unless this be some god who in wrath with the Trojans for offerings[178] failed afflicts them. The wrath of a god is hard to deal with.”[179] Then in answer the shining son of Lykaon spoke to him:[180] “Aineias, charged with the counsels of the bronze-armoured Trojans,[181] I liken him in all ways to the valiant son of Tydeus,  p 53  [182] going by his shield and the hollow eyes of his helmet[183] and by the look of his horses; but it may be a god, I am not sure;[184] and if this is a man, as I think, and the valiant son[185] of Tydeus, yet not without god does he rage so, but some one[186] of the immortals, mantling in mist his shoulders, stands close beside him[187] who turned my flying arrow as it struck, elsewhere, away from him.[188] For I have shot my shaft already, and hit him in the shoulder,[189] the right one, hard driven through the hollow of his corselet,[190] and I said to myself I had hurled him down to meet Aidoneus,[191] yet still I have not beaten him; now this is some god who is angered.[192] But I have no horses nor chariot I could mount in, and yet[193] somewhere in the great house of Lykaon are eleven chariots,[194] beauties, all new made, just finished, and over them blankets[195] lie spread, and beside each chariot one brace of horses[196] stand there, champing their white barley and oats. But Lykaon[197] the aged spearman spoke to me over and over, as I was[198] on my way from the house well compacted, advising me;[199] he told me to take my horses and chariots, and riding[200] there to be lord among the Trojans in the strong encounters.[201] I did not let him persuade me, and that would have been far better,[202] sparing my horses, who had grown accustomed to eating all[203] they wished, from going hungry where the men were penned in a small place.[204] So I left them and made my way on foot to Ilion[205] trusting my bow, a thing that was to profit me nothing.[206] For now I have drawn it against two of their best men, Tydeus’[207] son, and the son of Atreus, and both of these I hit[208] and drew visible blood, yet only wakened their anger.[209] So it was in bad luck that I took from its peg the curved bow[210] on that day when I carried it to lovely Ilion[211] at the head of my Trojans, bringing delight to brilliant Hektor.[212] Now if ever I win home again and lay eyes once more[213] on my country, and my wife, and the great house with the high roof,[214] let some stranger straightway cut my head from my shoulders[215] if I do not break this bow in my hands and throw it in the shining[216] fire, since as a wind and nothing I have taken it with me.”[217] Then in turn Aineias, lord of the Trojans, answered him:[218] “Speak no more this way; there will be no time for changing[219] before you and I must face this man with horses and chariot[220] and strength against strength fight it out with our weapons. Therefore[221] mount rather into my chariot, so that you may see[222] what the Trojan horses are like, how they understand their[223] plain, and how to traverse it in rapid pursuit and withdrawal.[224] These two will bring us safe to the city again, if once more[225] Zeus grants glory to Diomedes the son of Tydeus.[226] Come then, taking into your hands the goad and the glittering[227] reins, while I dismount from my chariot and carry the fighting;[228] or else yourself encounter this man, while I handle the horses.”[229] Then in answer the shining son of Lykaon spoke to him:[230] “Keep yourself, Aineias, the reins and your horses. These will[231] carry better the curved chariot under the driver[232] they know best, if we must give way before the son of Tydeus;  p 54  [233] for fear they might go wild with terror and not be willing[234] to carry us out of the fighting, as they listen and long for your voice,[235] for fear the son of high-hearted Tydeus charging upon us[236] might kill us both and drive away the single-foot horses.[237] Rather drive yourself your own horses and your own chariot[238] while with my sharp spear I encounter this man as he comes on.”[239] They spoke so, and mounting the wrought chariot held[240] their fast-running horses against the son of Tydeus, in fury.[241] And Sthenelos the shining son of Kapaneus seeing them[242] swiftly uttered his winged words to the son of Tydeus:[243] “Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,[244] look, I see two mighty men furious to fight with you.[245] Their strength is enormous, one of them well skilled in the bow’s work,[246] Pandaros, who claims his right as son of Lykaon,[247] and the other Aineias, who claims he was born as son to[248] Anchises the blameless, but his mother was Aphrodite.[249] Come then, let us give way with our horses; no longer storm on[250] so far among the champions, for fear you destroy your heart’s life.”[251] Then looking at him darkly strong Diomedes spoke to him:[252] “Argue me not toward flight, since I have no thought of obeying you.[253] No, for it would be ignoble for me to shrink back in the fighting[254] or to lurk aside, since my fighting strength stays steady forever.[255] I shrink indeed from mounting behind the horses, but as I am[256] now, I will face these. Pallas Athene will not let me run from them.[257] These two men, their fast-running horses shall never carry them[258] both back away from us, even though one man may escape us.[259] And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.[260] If Athene of the many counsels should grant me the glory[261] to kill both, then do you check here these fast-running horses,[262] ours, tethering them with the reins tied to the chariot’s rail and thereafter[263] remember to make a dash against the horses of Aineias,[264] and drive them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians.[265] These are of that strain which Zeus of the wide brows granted[266] once to Tros, recompense for his son Ganymedes, and therefore[267] are the finest of all horses beneath the sun and the daybreak;[268] and the lord of men Anchises stole horses from this breed,[269] without the knowledge of Laomedon putting mares under them.[270] From these there was bred for him a string of six in his great house.[271] Four of these, keeping them himself, he raised at his mangers,[272] but these two he gave to Aineias, two horses urgent of terror.[273] If we might only take these we should win ourselves excellent glory.”[274] Now as these were speaking things like this to each other,[275] the two came fast upon them driving their swift-running horses.[276] First to Diomedes called out the shining son of Lykaon:[277] “Valiant and strong-spirited, o son of proud Tydeus,[278] you were not beaten then by the bitter arrow, my swift shot.[279] Now I will try with the throwing-spear to see if I can hit you.”[280] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,[281] and struck the son of Tydeus in the shield, and the flying[282] bronze spearhead was driven clear through and into the corselet,[283] and the shining son of Lykaon cried aloud in a great voice:[284] “Now are you struck clean through the middle, and I think that you will not[285] hold up for much longer; you have given me great claim to glory.”  p 55  [286] Then strong Diomedes answered, not frightened before him:[287] “You did not hit me, you missed, but I do not think that you two[288] will go free until one or the other of you has fallen[289] to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield’s guard.”[290] He spoke, and threw; and Pallas Athene guided the weapon[291] to the nose next to the eye, and it cut on through the white teeth[292] and the bronze weariless shore all the way through the tongue’s base[293] so that the spearhead came out underneath the jawbone.[294] He dropped then from the chariot and his armour clattered upon him,[295] dazzling armour and shining, while those fast-running horses[296] shied away, and there his life and his strength were scattered.[297] But Aineias sprang to the ground with shield and with long spear,[298] for fear that somehow the Achaians might haul off the body,[299] and like a lion in the pride of his strength stood over him[300] holding before him the perfect circle of his shield and the spear[301] and raging to cut down any man who might come to face him,[302] crying a terrible cry. But Tydeus’ son in his hand caught[303] up a stone, a huge thing which no two men could carry[304] such as men are now, but by himself he lightly hefted it.[305] He threw, and caught Aineias in the hip, in the place where the hip-bone[306] turns inside the thigh, the place men call the cup-socket.[307] It smashed the cup-socket and broke the tendons both sides of it,[308] and the rugged stone tore the skin backward, so that the fighter[309] dropping to one knee stayed leaning on the ground with his heavy[310] hand, and a covering of black night came over both eyes.[311] Now in this place Aineias lord of men might have perished[312] had not Aphrodite, Zeus’ daughter, been quick to perceive him,[313] his mother, who had borne him to Anchises the ox-herd;[314] and about her beloved son came streaming her white arms,[315] and with her white robe thrown in a fold in front she shielded him,[316] this keeping off the thrown weapons lest some fast-mounted Danaan[317] strike the bronze spear through his chest and strip the life from him.[318] She then carried her beloved son out of the fighting.[319] Nor did Sthenelos son of Kapaneus forget the commandments[320] that Diomedes of the great war cry had laid upon him,[321] but he held where they were their own single-foot horses[322] with their reins tied to the chariot rail, apart from the confusion,[323] and making a dash for the fluttering-maned horses of Aineias[324] drove them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians,[325] and gave them to Deïpylos, his close friend, whom beyond all[326] others of his own age he prized, for their hearts were intimate,[327] to drive away to the hollow ships; meanwhile the warrior[328] mounted behind his own horses and caught up the shining[329] reins, and held the strong-footed team toward the son of Tydeus[330] headlong; and he swung the pitiless bronze at the lady of Kypros,[331] knowing her for a god without warcraft, not of those who,[332] goddesses, range in order the ranks of men in the fighting,[333] not Athene and not Enyo, sacker of cities.[334] Now as, following her through the thick crowd, he caught her,[335] lunging in his charge far forward the son of high-hearted[336] Tydeus made a thrust against the soft hand with the bronze spear,[337] and the spear tore the skin driven clean on through the immortal[338] robe that the very Graces had woven for her carefully,  p 56  [339] over the palm’s base; and blood immortal flowed from the goddess,[340] ichor, that which runs in the veins of the blessed divinities;[341] since these eat no food, nor do they drink of the shining[342] wine, and therefore they have no blood and are called immortal.[343] She gave a great shriek and let fall her son she was carrying,[344] but Phoibos Apollo caught him up and away in his own hands,[345] in a dark mist, for fear that some fast-mounted Danaan[346] might strike the bronze spear through his chest and strip the life from him.[347] But Diomedes of the great war cry shouted after her:[348] “Give way, daughter of Zeus, from the fighting and the terror. It is[349] not then enough that you lead astray women without warcraft?[350] Yet, if still you must haunt the fighting, I think that now you[351] will shiver even when you hear some other talking of battles.”[352] So he spoke, and the goddess departed in pain, hurt badly,[353] and Iris wind-footed took her by the hand and led her away[354] from the battle, her lovely skin blood-darkened, wounded and suffering.[355] There to the left of the fighting she found Ares the violent[356] sitting, his spear leaned into the mist, and his swift horses.[357] Dropping on one knee before her beloved brother[358] in deep supplication she asked for his gold-bridled horses:[359] “Beloved brother, rescue me and give me your horses[360] so I may come to Olympos where is the place of the immortals.[361] I am in too much pain from the wound of a mortal’s spear-stroke,[362] Tydeus’ son’s who would fight now even against Zeus father.”[363] So she spoke, and Ares gave her the gold-bridled horses,[364] and, still grieved in the inward heart, she mounted the chariot[365] and beside her entering Iris gathered the reins up[366] and whipped them into a run, and they winged their way unreluctant.[367] Now as they came to sheer Olympos, the place of the immortals,[368] there swift Iris the wind-footed reined in her horses[369] and slipped them from the yoke and threw fodder immortal before them,[370] and now bright Aphrodite fell at the knees of her mother,[371] Dione, who gathered her daughter into the arms’ fold[372] and stroked her with her hand and called her by name and spoke to her:[373] “Who now of the Uranian gods, dear child, has done such[374] things to you, rashly, as if you were caught doing something wicked?”[375] Aphrodite the sweetly laughing spoke then and answered her:[376] “Tydeus’ son Diomedes, the too high-hearted, stabbed me[377] as I was carrying my own beloved son out of the fighting,[378] Aineias, who beyond all else in the world is dear to me;[379] so now this is no horrible war of Achaians and Trojans,[380] but the Danaans are beginning to fight even with the immortals.”[381] Then Dione the shining among divinities answered her:[382] “Have patience, my child, and endure it, though you be saddened.[383] For many of us who have our homes on Olympos endure things[384] from men, when ourselves we inflict hard pain on each other.[385] Ares had to endure it when strong Ephialtes and Otos,[386] sons of Aloeus, chained him in bonds that were too strong for him,[387] and three months and ten he lay chained in the brazen cauldron;[388] and now might Ares, insatiable of fighting, have perished,[389] had not Eëriboia, their stepmother, the surpassingly lovely,[390] brought word to Hermes, who stole Ares away out of it  p 57  [391] as he was growing faint and the hard bondage was breaking him.[392] Hera had to endure it when the strong son of Amphitryon[393] struck her beside the right breast with a tri-barbed arrow,[394] so that the pain he gave her could not be quieted. Hades[395] the gigantic had to endure with the rest the flying arrow[396] when this self-same man, the son of Zeus of the aegis,[397] struck him among the dead men at Pylos, and gave him to agony;[398] but he went up to the house of Zeus and to tall Olympos[399] heavy at heart, stabbed through and through with pain, for the arrow[400] was driven into his heavy shoulder, and his spirit was suffering.[401] But Paiëon, scattering medicines that still pain,[402] healed him, since he was not made to be one of the mortals.[403] Brute, heavy-handed, who thought nothing of the bad he was doing,[404] who with his archery hurt the gods that dwell on Olympos![405] It was the goddess grey-eyed Athene who drove on this man[406] against you; poor fool, the heart of Tydeus’ son knows nothing[407] of how that man who fights the immortals lives for no long time,[408] his children do not gather to his knees to welcome their father[409] when he returns home after the fighting and the bitter warfare.[410] Then, though he be very strong indeed, let the son of Tydeus[411] take care lest someone even better than he might fight with him,[412] lest for a long time Aigialeia, wise child of Adrastos,[413] mourning wake out of sleep her household’s beloved companions,[414] longing for the best of the Achaians, her lord by marriage,[415] she, the strong wife of Diomedes, breaker of horses.”[416] She spoke, and with both hands stroked away from her arm the ichor,[417] so that the arm was made whole again and the strong pains rested.[418] But Hera and Athene glancing aside at her began[419] to tease the son of Kronos, Zeus, in words of mockery:[420] and the goddess grey-eyed Athene began the talk among them:[421] “Father Zeus, would you be angry with me if I said[422] something? It must be the lady of Kypros, moving some woman[423] of Achaia to follow after those Trojans she loves so hopelessly,[424] laying hold on the fair dresses of the Achaian women,[425] tore the tenderness of her hand on a golden pin’s point.”[426] So she spoke, and the father of gods and men smiled on her[427] and spoke to Aphrodite the golden, calling her to him:[428] “No, my child, not for you are the works of warfare. Rather[429] concern yourself only with the lovely secrets of marriage,[430] while all this shall be left to Athene and sudden Ares.”[431] Now as these were talking in this way with each other[432] Diomedes of the great war cry made for Aineias.[433] Though he saw how Apollo himself held his hands over him[434] he did not shrink even from the great god, but forever forward[435] drove, to kill Aineias and strip his glorious armour.[436] Three times, furious to cut him down, he drove forward,[437] and three times Apollo battered aside the bright shield,[438] but as a fourth time, like more than man, he charged, Apollo[439] who strikes from afar cried out to him in the voice of terror:[440] “Take care, give back, son of Tydeus, and strive no longer[441] to make yourself like the gods in mind, since never the same is[442] the breed of gods, who are immortal, and men who walk groundling.”  p 58  [443] He spoke, and Tydeus’ son gave backward, only a little,[444] avoiding the anger of him who strikes from afar, Apollo,[445] who caught Aineias now away from the onslaught, and set him[446] in the sacred keep of Pergamos where was built his own temple.[447] There Artemis of the showering arrows and Leto within[448] the great and secret chamber healed his wound and cared for him.[449] But he of the silver bow, Apollo, fashioned an image[450] in the likeness of Aineias himself and in armour like him,[451] and all about this image brilliant Achaians and Trojans[452] hewed at each other, and at the ox-hide shields strong circled[453] guarding men’s chests, and at the fluttering straps of the guard-skins.[454] But Phoibos Apollo spoke now to violent Ares:[455] “Ares, Ares, manslaughtering, blood-stained, stormer of strong walls,[456] is there no way you can go and hold back this man from the fighting,[457] Tydeus’ son, who would now do battle against Zeus father?[458] Even now he stabbed in her hand by the wrist the lady[459] of Kypros, and again, like more than a man, charged even against me.”[460] So he spoke, and himself alighted on the peak of Pergamos[461] while stark Ares went down to stir the ranks of the Trojans,[462] in the likeness of the lord of the Thracians, swift-footed Akamas,[463] and urged onward the god-supported children of Priam:[464] “O you children of Priam, the king whom the gods love, how long[465] will you allow the Achaians to go on killing your people?[466] Until they fight beside the strong-builded gates? A man lies[467] fallen whom we honoured as we honour Hektor the brilliant,[468] Aineias, who is son of great-hearted Anchises.[469] Come then, let us rescue our good companion from the carnage.”[470] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and the strength in each man.[471] Then Sarpedon spoke in abuse to brilliant Hektor:[472] “Where now, Hektor, has gone that strength that was yours? You said once[473] that without companions and without people you could hold this city[474] alone, with only your brothers and the lords of your sisters.[475] I can see not one of these men now, I know not where they are;[476] no, but they slink away like hounds who circle the lion,[477] while we, who are here as your companions, carry the fighting.[478] I have come, a companion to help you, from a very far place;[479] Lykia lies far away, by the whirling waters of Xanthos;[480] there I left behind my own wife and my baby son, there[481] I left my many possessions which the needy man eyes longingly.[482] Yet even so I drive on my Lykians, and myself have courage[483] to fight my man in battle, though there is nothing of mine here[484] that the Achaians can carry away as spoil or drive off.[485] But you: you stand here, not even giving the word to the rest[486] of your people to stand fast and fight in defence of their own wives.[487] Let not yourselves, caught as in the sweeping toils of the spun net,[488] be taken as war-spoil and plunder by the men who hate you,[489] men who presently will storm your strong-founded citadel.[490] All these things should lie night and day on your mind, forever,[491] supplication to the lords of your far-renowned companions,[492] to fight unwearying and hold off the strength of an insult.”[493] Sarpedon spoke, and his word bit into the heart of Hektor.[494] Straightway in all his armour he sprang to the ground from his chariot  p 59  [495] and shaking two sharp spears ranged everywhere through the army[496] stirring men up to fight and waking the hateful warfare;[497] and these pulled themselves about and stood to face the Achaians,[498] while the Argives held in their close order and would not be broken.[499] As when along the hallowed threshing floors the wind scatters[500] chaff, among men winnowing, and fair-haired Demeter[501] in the leaning wind discriminates the chaff and the true grain[502] and the piling chaff whitens beneath it, so now the Achaians[503] turned white underneath the dust the feet of the horses[504] drove far into the brazen sky across their faces[505] as they rapidly closed and the charioteers wheeled back again.[506] They drove the strength of their hands straight on, as violent Ares[507] defending the Trojans mantled in dark night the battle[508] and passed everywhere, since he was carrying out the commandments[509] of Phoibos Apollo, him of the golden sword, who had bidden him[510] wake the heart in the Trojans as he saw that Pallas Athene[511] was gone away now, she who stood to defend the Danaans.[512] And out of the rich secret chamber Apollo sent forth[513] Aineias, and dropped strength in the heart of the people’s shepherd.[514] So Aineias stood among his friends, who were happy[515] as they saw him coming back, still alive, and unwounded[516] and full of brave spirit; yet they asked him no question,[517] for the rest of their fighting work would not let them, that the silver-bow god[518] woke, and manslaughtering Ares, and Hate, whose wrath is relentless.[519] Now the two Aiantes and Odysseus and Diomedes[520] stirred the Danaans to fight these; since themselves they did not[521] fear the force of the men of Troy nor their charges onward,[522] but stayed where they were, like clouds, which the son of Kronos[523] stops in the windless weather on the heights of the towering mountains,[524] motionless, when the strength of the north wind sleeps, and the other[525] tearing winds, those winds that when they blow into tempests[526] high screaming descend upon the darkening clouds and scatter them.[527] So the Danaans stood steady against the Trojans, nor gave way.[528] And Atreus’ son ranged through the masses with his many orders:[529] “Be men now, dear friends, and take up the heart of courage,[530] and have consideration for each other in the strong encounters,[531] since more come through alive when men consider each other,[532] and there is no glory when they give way, nor warcraft either.”[533] He spoke, and made a swift cast with his spear, and struck down a great man[534] Deïkoön, companion of high-hearted Aineias,[535] Pergasos’ son, whom the Trojans honoured as they honoured Priam’s[536] children, since he was a swift man to fight in the foremost.[537] Powerful Agamemnon struck his shield with spear, nor[538] could the shield hold off the spear, but the bronze smashed clean through[539] and was driven on through the belt to the deep of the belly.[540] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.[541] Now Aineias killed two great men of the Danaans,[542] the sons of Diokles, Orsilochos and Krethon,[543] men whose father dwelt in Phere the strong-founded,[544] rich in substance, and his generation was of the river  p 60  [545] Alpheios, who flows wide through the country of the Pylians,[546] and who got a son, Ortilochos, to be lord over many[547] men, but the son of Ortilochos was high-hearted Diokles;[548] and to Diokles in his turn were two twin sons born,[549] Orsilochos and Krethon, both well skilled in all fighting.[550] These two as they were grown to young manhood followed along with[551] the Argives in their black ships to Ilion, land of good horses,[552] winning honour for the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon[553] and Menelaos; now fulfilment of death was a darkness upon them.[554] These, as two young lions in the high places of the mountains,[555] had been raised by their mother in the dark of the deep forest,[556] lions which as they prey upon the cattle and the fat sheep[557] lay waste the steadings where there are men, until they also[558] fall and are killed under the cutting bronze in the men’s hands;[559] such were these two who beaten under the hands of Aineias[560] crashed now to the ground as if they were two tall pine trees.[561] As these fell warlike Menelaos took pity on them[562] and he strode out among the champions, helmed in bright bronze,[563] shaking his spear, and the fury of Ares drove him onward,[564] minded that he might go down under the hands of Aineias.[565] But Antilochos, son of high-hearted Nestor, watched him,[566] and he strode among the champions in fear for the shepherd of the people,[567] lest he be hurt, and all their labour slip away into nothing.[568] So as Aineias and Menelaos raised hand and sharp spear[569] standing to face each other and furious to do battle,[570] Antilochos took his stand close beside the shepherd of the people.[571] Nor did Aineias hold his ground, though yet a swift fighter,[572] as he saw two men staying with each other against him.[573] These, when they had dragged back the bodies among the Achaian[574] people, dropped the poor youths into the hands of their company,[575] and themselves wheeled about once more to fight among the foremost.[576] There these killed Pylaimenes the equal of Ares,[577] lord of the Paphlagonian men in armour, high-hearted.[578] Menelaos the spear-famed, son of Atreus, stabbed him[579] with the spear as he stood his ground, and struck the collar-bone,[580] while Antilochos struck down Mydon, his charioteer and[581] henchman, Atymnios’ brave son, as he wheeled the single-foot[582] horses about, with a stone striking mid-elbow, and from his[583] hands the reins pale with ivory dropped in the dust groundling.[584] Antilochos charging drove the sword into his temple,[585] so that gasping he dropped from the carefully wrought chariot[586] headlong, driven deep in the dust his neck and shoulders;[587] and there, since he chanced to light in a depth of sand, he stuck fast[588] while his horses trampled him into the dust with their feet. These[589] Antilochos lashed and drove back into the host of the Achaians.[590] Hektor saw them across the ranks, and drove on against them[591] crying aloud, and with him followed the Trojan battalions[592] in their strength; and Ares led them with the goddess Enyo,[593] she carrying with her the turmoil of shameless hatred[594] while Ares made play in his hands with the spear gigantic[595] and ranged now in front of Hektor and now behind him.[596] Diomedes of the great war cry shivered as he saw him,  p 61  [597] and like a man in his helplessness who, crossing a great plain,[598] stands at the edge of a fast-running river that dashes seaward,[599] and watches it thundering into white water, and leaps a pace backward,[600] so now Tydeus’ son gave back, and spoke to his people:[601] “Friends, although we know the wonder of glorious Hektor[602] to be a fighter with the spear and a bold man of battle,[603] yet there goes ever some god beside him, who beats off destruction,[604] and now, in the likeness of a man mortal, Ares goes with him.[605] Come then, keeping your faces turned to the Trojans, give ground[606] backward, nor be we eager to fight in strength with divinities.”[607] He spoke, and now the Trojans had come very close upon them.[608] There Hektor cut down two men, well skilled in warcraft,[609] Anchialos and Menesthes both in a single chariot.[610] As these fell great Telamonian Aias pitied them[611] and stood close in and made a cast with the shining javelin,[612] and struck Amphios, Selagos’ son, who rich in possessions[613] and rich in cornland had lived in Paisos, but his own destiny[614] brought him companion in arms to Priam and the children of Priam.[615] Now Telamonian Aias struck him beneath the war belt[616] and the far-shadowing spear was fixed in the lower belly,[617] and he fell, thunderously, and shining Aias ran forward[618] to strip his armour, but the Trojans showered spears upon him,[619] sharp spears and glittering, and the great shield caught many.[620] Setting his heel on the chest of the corpse he pulled out the brazen[621] spear, yet could no longer strip the rest of the glorious[622] armour from his shoulders, since he was battered with spears thrown,[623] and he dreaded the strong circle made by the haughty Trojans,[624] who many and valiant stood over him, gripping their great spears,[625] and though he was a mighty man and a strong and a proud one[626] thrust him away from them so that he gave ground backward staggering.[627] So they went at their work all about the strong encounter.[628] But Herakles’ son Tlepolemos the huge and mighty[629] was driven by his strong destiny against godlike Sarpedon.[630] Now as these in their advance had come close together,[631] the own son, and the son’s son of Zeus cloud-gathering,[632] it was Tlepolemos of the two who spoke the first word:[633] “Man of counsel of the Lykians, Sarpedon, why must you[634] be skulking here, you who are a man unskilled in the fighting?[635] They are liars who call you issue of Zeus, the holder[636] of the aegis, since you fall far short in truth of the others[637] who were begotten of Zeus in the generations before us:[638] such men as, they say, was the great strength of Herakles,[639] my own father, of the daring spirit, the heart of a lion:[640] he came here on a time for the sake of Laomedon’s horses,[641] with six vessels only and the few men needed to man them,[642] and widowed the streets of Ilion and sacked the city;[643] but yours is the heart of a coward and your people are dying.[644] And I think that now, though you are come from Lykia, you will[645] bring no help to the Trojans even though you be a strong man,[646] but beaten down by my hands will pass through the gates of Hades.”[647] In turn the lord of the Lykians, Sarpedon, answered him:[648] “In truth, Tlepolemos, he did destroy Ilion the sacred  p 62  [649] through the senselessness of one man, the haughty Laomedon,[650] who gave Herakles an evil word in return for good treatment[651] and would not give up the horses for whose sake he had come from far off.[652] But I tell you, what you will win from me here will be death[653] and black destruction; and broken under my spear you will give me[654] glory, and give your soul to Hades of the famed horses.”[655] So spoke Sarpedon, while the other lifted his ash spear,[656] Tlepolemos; and in a single moment the long shafts[657] shot from their hands, Sarpedon striking him in the middle[658] of the throat, and the agonizing spear drove clean through[659] and over his eyes was mantled the covering mist of darkness.[660] But Tlepolemos in turn had struck Sarpedon with the long spear[661] in the left thigh, and the spear smashed on through in fury[662] scraping the bone, but his father fended destruction away from him.[663] But his brilliant companions carried godlike Sarpedon[664] out of the fighting, weighted down as he was by the long spear[665] which dragged, yet not one of them noticed nor took thought,[666] in their urgency, to pull out of his thigh the ash spear[667] so he might stand, such hard work did they have attending him.[668] On the other side the strong-greaved Achaians carried Tlepolemos[669] out of the fighting; but brilliant Odysseus, who held a hardy[670] spirit, saw what had happened, and his heart within was stirred up,[671] but now he pondered two ways within, in mind and in spirit,[672] whether first to go after the son of Zeus the loud-thundering[673] or whether he should strip the life from more of the Lykians.[674] Yet, as it was not the destiny of great-hearted Odysseus[675] to kill with sharp bronze the strong son of Zeus, therefore[676] Athene steered his anger against the host of the Lykians.[677] And there he killed Koiranos, and Chromios, and Alastor,[678] Halios and Alkandros, and Prytanis and Noemon.[679] And now might brilliant Odysseus have killed yet more of the Lykians[680] had not tall Hektor of the shining helmet sharply perceived him,[681] who strode out among the champions helmed in the bright bronze[682] bringing terror to the Danaans; but Zeus’ son, Sarpedon,[683] was glad as he saw him come up, and piteously bespoke him:[684] “Son of Priam, do not leave me lying for the Danaans[685] to prey upon, but protect me, since otherwise in your city[686] my life must come to an end, since I could return no longer[687] back to my own house and the land of my fathers, bringing[688] joy to my own beloved wife and my son, still a baby.”[689] He spoke, but Hektor of the shining helm did not answer[690] but swept on past him in his eagerness with all speed[691] to push back the Argives and strip the life out of many.[692] Meanwhile his brilliant companions laid godlike Sarpedon[693] under a lovely spreading oak of Zeus of the aegis,[694] and strong Pelagon, one of his beloved companions,[695] pushed perforce through and out of his thigh the shaft of the ash spear.[696] And the mist mantled over his eyes, and the life left him,[697] but he got his breath back again, and the blast of the north wind[698] blowing brought back to life the spirit gasped out in agony.[699] But the Argives under the strength of Ares and bronze-armoured Hektor[700] did not ever turn their backs and make for their black ships  p 63  [701] nor yet stand up to them in fighting, but always backward[702] gave way, as they saw how Ares went with the Trojans.[703] Who then was the first and who the last that they slaughtered,[704] Hektor, Priam’s son, and Ares the brazen? Godlike[705] Teuthras first, and next Orestes, driver of horses,[706] Trechos the spearman of Aitolia and Oinomaos,[707] Helenos son of Oinops and Oresbios of the shining[708] guard, who had lived in Hyle much concerned with his property[709] in a place hard on the Kephisian mere, and beside him other[710] men of Boiotia lived and held the fine fertile country.[711] Now as the goddess Hera of the white arms perceived how[712] the Argives were perishing in the strong encounter,[713] immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:[714] “For shame, now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis:[715] nothing then meant the word we promised to Menelaos,[716] to go home after sacking the strong-walled city of Ilion,[717] if we are to let cursed Ares be so furious.[718] Come then, let us rather think of our own stark courage.”[719] So she spoke, nor did the goddess grey-eyed Athene[720] disobey her. But Hera, high goddess, daughter of Kronos[721] the mighty, went away to harness the gold-bridled horses.[722] Then Hebe in speed set about the chariot the curved wheels[723] eight-spoked and brazen, with an axle of iron both ways.[724] Golden is the wheel’s felly imperishable, and outside it[725] is joined, a wonder to look upon, the brazen running-rim,[726] and the silver naves revolve on either side of the chariot,[727] whereas the car itself is lashed fast with plaiting of gold[728] and silver, with double chariot rails that circle about it,[729] and the pole of the chariot is of silver, to whose extremity[730] Hebe made fast the golden and splendid yoke, and fastened[731] the harness, golden and splendid, and underneath the yoke Hera,[732] furious for hate and battle, led the swift-running horses.[733] Now in turn Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,[734] beside the threshold of her father slipped off her elaborate[735] dress which she herself had wrought with her hands’ patience,[736] and now assuming the war tunic of Zeus who gathers[737] the clouds, she armed in her gear for the dismal fighting.[738] And across her shoulders she threw the betasselled, terrible[739] aegis, all about which Terror hangs like a garland,[740] and Hatred is there, and Battle Strength, and heart-freezing Onslaught[741] and thereon is set the head of the grim gigantic Gorgon,[742] a thing of fear and horror, portent of Zeus of the aegis.[743] Upon her head she set the golden helm with its four sheets[744] and two horns, wrought with the fighting men of a hundred cities.[745] She set her feet in the blazing chariot and took up a spear[746] heavy, huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting[747] men, against whom she of mighty father is angered.[748] Here laid the lash swiftly on the horses; and moving[749] of themselves groaned the gates of the sky that the Hours guarded,[750] those Hours to whose charge is given the huge sky and Olympos,[751] to open up the dense darkness or again to close it.[752] Through the way between they held the speed of their goaded horses.  p 64  [753] They found the son of Kronos sitting apart from the other[754] gods, upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos.[755] There the goddess of the white arms, Hera, stopping her horses,[756] spoke to Zeus, high son of Kronos, and asked him a question:[757] “Father Zeus, are you not angry with Ares for his violent[758] acts, for killing so many and such good Achaian warriors[759] for no reason, and out of due order, to grieve me? And meanwhile[760] Kypris and Apollo of the silver bow take their ease and their pleasure[761] having let loose this maniac who knows nothing of justice.[762] Father Zeus, would you be angry with me if I were[763] to smite Ares with painful strokes and drive him out of the fighting?”[764] Then in turn the father of gods and men made answer:[765] “Go to it then, and set against him the spoiler Athene,[766] who beyond all others is the one to visit harsh pains upon him.”[767] So he spoke, nor did the goddess of the white arms, Hera,[768] disobey, but lashed on the horses, and they winged their way unreluctant[769] through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.[770] As far as into the hazing distance a man can see with[771] his eyes, who sits in his eyrie gazing on the wine-blue water,[772] as far as this is the stride of the gods’ proud neighing horses.[773] Now as they came to Troy land and the two running rivers[774] where Simoeis and Skamandros dash their waters together,[775] there the goddess of the white arms, Hera, stayed her horses,[776] slipping them from the chariot, and drifting close mist about them,[777] and Simoeis grew as grass ambrosia for them to graze on.[778] Now these two walked forward in little steps like shivering[779] doves, in their eagerness to stand by the men of Argos,[780] after they had come to the place where the most and the bravest[781] stood close huddled about the great strength of the breaker of horses,[782] Diomedes; in the likeness of lions who rend their meat raw,[783] or wild pigs, boars, in whom the strength diminishes never,[784] there standing the goddess of the white arms, Hera, shouted,[785] likening herself to high-hearted, bronze-voiced Stentor,[786] who could cry out in as great a voice as fifty other men:[787] “Shame, you Argives, poor nonentities splendid to look on.[788] In those days when brilliant Achilleus came into the fighting,[789] never would the Trojans venture beyond the Dardanian[790] gates, so much did they dread the heavy spear of that man.[791] Now they fight by the hollow ships and far from the city.”[792] So she spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[793] But the goddess grey-eyed Athene made straight for Tydeus’[794] son, and found the king standing by his horses and chariot,[795] cooling the wound that Pandaros made with the cast of his arrow.[796] For the sweat made him sore underneath the broad strap of the circled[797] shield; this made him sore, and his arm was tired. He held up[798] the shield-strap, and wiped the dark blot of blood away from it.[799] The goddess laid hold of the harnessed horses and spoke to him:[800] “Tydeus got him a son who is little enough like him:[801] since Tydeus was a small man for stature, but he was a fighter.[802] Even on that time when I would not consent to his fighting[803] nor drawing men’s eyes, when he went by himself without the Achaians[804] as a messenger to Thebe among all the Kadmeians,  p 65  [805] then I invited him to feast at his ease in their great halls;[806] even so, keeping that heart of strength that was always within him[807] he challenged the young men of the Kadmeians, and defeated all of them[808] easily; such a helper was I who stood then beside him.[809] Now beside you also I stand and ever watch over you,[810] and urge you to fight confidently with the Trojans. And yet[811] the weariness has entered your limbs from many encounters,[812] or else it is some poor-spirited fear that holds you. If so,[813] you are no issue then of the son of wise Oineus, Tydeus.”[814] Then in answer powerful Diomedes spoke to her:[815] “Daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis, goddess, I know you,[816] and therefore will speak confidently to you, and hide nothing.[817] It is no poor-spirited fear nor shrinking that holds me.[818] Rather I remember the orders you yourself gave me[819] when you would not let me fight in the face of the blessed immortals—[820] the rest of them, except only if Aphrodite, Zeus’ daughter,[821] went into the fighting, I might stab at her with the sharp bronze.[822] Therefore now have I myself given way, and I ordered[823] the rest of the Argives all to be gathered in this place beside me,[824] since I see that this who is lord of the fighting is Ares.”[825] Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:[826] “Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,[827] no longer be thus afraid of Ares, nor of any other[828] immortal; such a helper shall I be standing beside you.[829] Come then, first against Ares steer your single-foot horses,[830] and strike him from close. Be not afraid of violent Ares,[831] that thing of fury, evil-wrought, that double-faced liar[832] who even now protested to Hera and me, promising[833] that he would fight against the Trojans and stand by the Argives.[834] Now, all promises forgotten, he stands by the Trojans.”[835] So speaking she pushed Sthenelos to the ground from the chariot,[836] driving him back with her hand, and he leapt away from it lightly,[837] and she herself, a goddess in her anger, stepped into the chariot[838] beside brilliant Diomedes, and the oaken axle groaned aloud[839] under the weight, carrying a dread goddess and a great man.[840] Pallas Athene then took up the whip and the reins, steering[841] first of all straight on against Ares the single-foot horses.[842] Ares was in the act of stripping gigantic Periphas,[843] shining son of Ochesios, far the best of the men of Aitolia.[844] Blood-stained Ares was in the act of stripping him. But Athene[845] put on the helm of Death, that stark Ares might not discern her.[846] Now as manslaughtering Ares caught sight of Diomedes[847] the brilliant, he let gigantic Periphas lie in the place where[848] he had first cut him down and taken the life away from him,[849] and made straight against Diomedes, breaker of horses.[850] Now as they in their advance had come close together,[851] Ares lunged first over the yoke and the reins of his horses[852] with the bronze spear, furious to take the life from him.[853] But the goddess grey-eyed Athene in her hand catching[854] the spear pushed it away from the car, so he missed and stabbed vainly.[855] After him Diomedes of the great war cry drove forward[856] with the bronze spear; and Pallas Athene, leaning in on it,  p 66  [857] drove it into the depth of the belly where the war belt girt him.[858] Picking this place she stabbed and driving it deep in the fair flesh[859] wrenched the spear out again. Then Ares the brazen bellowed[860] with a sound as great as nine thousand men make, or ten thousand,[861] when they cry as they carry into the fighting the fury of the war god.[862] And a shivering seized hold alike on Achaians and Trojans[863] in their fear at the bellowing of battle-insatiate Ares.[864] As when out of the thunderhead the air shows darkening[865] after a day’s heat when the stormy wind uprises,[866] thus to Tydeus’ son Diomedes Ares the brazen[867] showed as he went up with the clouds into the wide heaven.[868] Lightly he came to the gods’ citadel, headlong Olympos,[869] and sat down beside Kronian Zeus, grieving in his spirit,[870] and showed him the immortal blood dripping from the spear cut.[871] So in sorrow for himself he addressed him in winged words:[872] “Father Zeus, are you not angry looking on these acts of violence?[873] We who are gods forever have to endure the most horrible[874] hurts, by each other’s hatred, as we try to give favour to mortals.[875] It is your fault we fight, since you brought forth this maniac daughter[876] accursed, whose mind is fixed forever on unjust action.[877] For all the rest, as many as are gods on Olympos,[878] are obedient to you, and we all have rendered ourselves submissive.[879] Yet you say nothing and you do nothing to check this girl, letting[880] her go free, since yourself you begot this child of perdition.[881] See now, the son of Tydeus, Diomedes the haughty,[882] she has egged on to lash out in fury against the immortal[883] gods. First he stabbed the Kyprian in the arm by the wrist. Then[884] like something more than human he swept on even against me.[885] But my swift feet took me out of the way. Otherwise I should[886] long be lying there in pain among the stark dead men,[887] or go living without strength because of the strokes of the bronze spear.”[888] Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:[889] “Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.[890] To me you are most hateful of all gods who hold Olympos.[891] Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.[892] Truly the anger of Hera your mother is grown out of all hand[893] nor gives ground; and try as I may I am broken by her arguments,[894] and it is by her impulse, I think, you are suffering all this.[895] And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since[896] you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.[897] But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous[898] long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky.”[899] So he spoke, and told Paiëon to heal him; and scattering[900] medicines to still pain upon him Paiëon rendered him[901] well again, since he was not made to be one of the mortals.[902] As when the juice of the fig in white milk rapidly fixes[903] that which was fluid before and curdles quickly for one who[904] stirs it; in such speed as this he healed violent Ares;[905] and Hebe washed him clean and put delicate clothing upon him.[906] And rejoicing in the glory of his strength he sat down beside Kronion.[907] Meanwhile, the two went back again to the house of great Zeus,  p 67  [908] Hera of Argos, with Athene who stands by her people,[909] after they stopped the murderous work of manslaughtering Ares.book six[1] So the grim encounter of Achaians and Trojans was left[2] to itself, and the battle veered greatly now one way, now in another,[3] over the plain as they guided their bronze spears at each other[4] in the space between the waters of Xanthos and Simoeis.[5] First Telamonian Aias, that bastion of the Achaians,[6] broke the Trojan battalions and brought light to his own company,[7] striking down the man who was far the best of the Thracians,[8] Akamas, the huge and mighty, the son of Eussoros.[9] Throwing first, he struck the horn of the horse-haired helmet[10] and the bronze spear-point fixed in his forehead and drove inward[11] through the bone; and a mist of darkness clouded both eyes.[12] Diomedes of the great war cry cut down Axylos,[13] Teuthras’ son, who had been a dweller in strong-founded Arisbe,[14] a man rich in substance and a friend to all humanity[15] since in his house by the wayside he entertained all comers.[16] Yet there was none of these now to stand before him and keep off[17] the sad destruction, and Diomedes stripped life from both of them,[18] Axylos and his henchman Kalesios, who was the driver[19] guiding his horses; so down to the underworld went both men.[20] Now Euryalos slaughtered Opheltios and Dresos,[21] and went in pursuit of Aisepos and Pedasos, those whom the naiad[22] nymph Abarbare had born to blameless Boukolion.[23] Boukolion himself was the son of haughty Laomedon,[24] eldest born, but his mother conceived him in darkness and secrecy.[25] While shepherding his flocks he lay with the nymph and loved her,[26] and she conceiving bore him twin boys. But now Mekistios’[27] son unstrung the strength of these and the limbs in their glory,[28] Euryalos, and stripped the armour away from their shoulders.[29] Polypoites the stubborn in battle cut down Astyalos,[30] while Odysseus slaughtered one from Perkote, Pidytes,[31] with the bronze spear, and great Aretaon was killed by Teukros.[32] Nestor’s son Antilochos with the shining shaft killed[33] Ableros; the lord of men, Agamemnon, brought death to Elatos,[34] whose home had been on the shores of Satnioeis’ lovely waters,[35] sheer Pedasos. And Leitos the fighter caught Phylakos[36] as he ran away; and Eurypylos made an end of Melanthios.[37] Now Menelaos of the great war cry captured Adrestos[38] alive; for his two horses bolting over the level land[39] got entangled in a tamarisk growth, and shattered the curving[40] chariot at the tip of the pole; so they broken free went[41] on toward the city, where many beside stampeded in terror.[42] So Adrestos was whirled beside the wheel from the chariot[43] headlong into the dust on his face; and the son of Atreus,[44] Menelaos, with the far-shadowed spear in his hand, stood over him.[45] But Adrestos, catching him by the knees, supplicated:[46] “Take me alive, son of Atreus, and take appropriate ransom.[47] In my rich father’s house the treasures lie piled in abundance;  p 68  [48] bronze is there, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,[49] and my father would make you glad with abundant repayment[50] were he to hear that I am alive by the ships of the Achaians.”[51] So he spoke, and moved the spirit inside Menelaos.[52] And now he was on the point of handing him to a henchman[53] to lead back to the fast Achaian ships; but Agamemnon[54] came on the run to join him and spoke his word of argument:[55] “Dear brother, o Menelaos, are you concerned so tenderly[56] with these people? Did you in your house get the best of treatment[57] from the Trojans? No, let not one of them go free of sudden[58] death and our hands; not the young man child that the mother carries[59] still in her body, not even he, but let all of Ilion’s[60] people perish, utterly blotted out and unmourned for.”[61] The hero spoke like this, and bent the heart of his brother[62] since he urged justice. Menelaos shoved with his hand Adrestos[63] the warrior back from him, and powerful Agamemnon[64] stabbed him in the side and, as he writhed over, Atreides,[65] setting his heel upon the midriff, wrenched out the ash spear.[66] Nestor in a great voice cried out to the men of Argos:[67] “O beloved Danaan fighters, henchmen of Ares,[68] let no man any more hang back with his eye on the plunder[69] designing to take all the spoil he can gather back to the vessels;[70] let us kill the men now, and afterwards at your leisure[71] all along the plain you can plunder the perished corpses.”[72] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[73] Then once more would the Trojans have climbed back into Ilion’s[74] wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians,[75] had not Priam’s son, Helenos, best by far of the augurs,[76] stood beside Aineias and Hektor and spoken a word to them:[77] “Hektor and Aineias, on you beyond others is leaning[78] the battle-work of Trojans and Lykians, since you are our greatest[79] in every course we take, whether it be in thought or in fighting:[80] stand your ground here; visit your people everywhere; hold them[81] fast by the gates, before they tumble into their women’s[82] arms, and become to our enemies a thing to take joy in.[83] Afterwards, when you have set all the battalions in motion,[84] the rest of us will stand fast here and fight with the Danaans[85] though we are very hard hit indeed; necessity forces us:[86] but you, Hektor, go back again to the city, and there tell[87] your mother and mine to assemble all the ladies of honour[88] at the temple of grey-eyed Athene high on the citadel;[89] there opening with a key the door to the sacred chamber[90] let her take a robe, which seems to her the largest and loveliest[91] in the great house, and that which is far her dearest possession,[92] and lay it along the knees of Athene the lovely haired. Let her[93] promise to dedicate within the shrine twelve heifers,[94] yearlings, never broken, if only she will have pity[95] on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children.[96] So she might hold back from sacred Ilion the son of Tydeus,[97] that wild spear-fighter, the strong one who drives men to thoughts of terror,[98] who I say now is become the strongest of all the Achaians.[99] For never did we so fear Achilleus even, that leader  p 69  [100] of men, who they say was born of a goddess. This man has gone clean[101] berserk, so that no one can match his warcraft against him.”[102] So he spoke, and Hektor did not disobey his brother,[103] but at once in all his armour leapt to the ground from his chariot[104] and shaking two sharp spears in his hands ranged over the whole host[105] stirring them up to fight and waking the ghastly warfare.[106] So they whirled about and stood their ground against the Achaians,[107] and the Argives gave way backward and stopped their slaughtering,[108] and thought some one of the immortals must have descended[109] from the starry sky to stand by the Trojans, the way they rallied.[110] But Hektor lifted his voice and cried aloud to the Trojans:[111] “You high-hearted Trojans and far-renowned companions,[112] be men now, dear friends, and remember your furious valour[113] until I can go back again to Ilion, and there tell[114] the elder men who sit as counsellors, and our own wives,[115] to make their prayer to the immortals and promise them hecatombs.”[116] So spoke Hektor of the shining helm, and departed;[117] and against his ankles as against his neck clashed the dark ox-hide,[118] the rim running round the edge of the great shield massive in the middle.[119] Now Glaukos, sprung of Hippolochos, and the son of Tydeus[120] came together in the space between the two armies, battle-bent.[121] Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,[122] first to speak was Diomedes of the great war cry:[123] “Who among mortal men are you, good friend? Since never[124] before have I seen you in the fighting where men win glory,[125] yet now you have come striding far out in front of all others[126] in your great heart, who have dared stand up to my spear far-shadowing.[127] Yet unhappy are those whose sons match warcraft against me.[128] But if you are some one of the immortals come down from the bright sky,[129] know that I will not fight against any god of the heaven,[130] since even the son of Dryas, Lykourgos the powerful, did not[131] live long; he who tried to fight with gods of the bright sky,[132] who once drove the fosterers of rapturous Dionysos[133] headlong down the sacred Nyseian hill, and all of them[134] shed and scattered their wands on the ground, stricken with an ox-goad[135] by murderous Lykourgos, while Dionysos in terror[136] dived into the salt surf, and Thetis took him to her bosom,[137] frightened, with the strong shivers upon him at the man’s blustering.[138] But the gods who live at their ease were angered with Lykourgos,[139] and the son of Kronos struck him to blindness, nor did he live long[140] afterwards, since he was hated by all the immortals.[141] Therefore neither would I be willing to fight with the blessed[142] gods; but if you are one of those mortals who eat what the soil yields,[143] come nearer, so that sooner you may reach your appointed destruction.”[144] Then in turn the shining son of Hippolochos answered:[145] “High-hearted son of Tydeus, why ask of my generation?[146] As is the generation of leaves, so is that of humanity.[147] The wind scatters the leaves on the ground, but the live timber[148] burgeons with leaves again in the season of spring returning.[149] So one generation of men will grow while another[150] dies. Yet if you wish to learn all this and be certain[151] of my genealogy: there are plenty of men who know it.  p 70  [152] There is a city, Ephyre, in the corner of horse-pasturing[153] Argos; there lived Sisyphos, that sharpest of all men,[154] Sisyphos, Aiolos’ son, and he had a son named Glaukos,[155] and Glaukos in turn sired Bellerophontes the blameless.[156] To Bellerophontes the gods granted beauty and desirable[157] manhood; but Proitos in anger devised evil things against him,[158] and drove him out of his own domain, since he was far greater,[159] from the Argive country Zeus had broken to the sway of his sceptre.[160] Beautiful Anteia the wife of Proitos was stricken[161] with passion to lie in love with him, and yet she could not[162] beguile valiant Bellerophontes, whose will was virtuous.[163] So she went to Proitos the king and uttered her falsehood:[164] ‘Would you be killed, o Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes[165] who tried to lie with me in love, though I was unwilling.’[166] So she spoke, and anger took hold of the king at her story.[167] He shrank from killing him, since his heart was awed by such action,[168] but sent him away to Lykia, and handed him murderous symbols,[169] which he inscribed in a folding tablet, enough to destroy life,[170] and told him to show it to his wife’s father, that he might perish.[171] Bellerophontes went to Lykia in the blameless convoy[172] of the gods; when he came to the running stream of Xanthos, and Lykia,[173] the lord of wide Lykia tendered him full-hearted honour.[174] Nine days he entertained him with sacrifice of nine oxen,[175] but afterwards when the rose fingers of the tenth dawn showed, then[176] he began to question him, and asked to be shown the symbols,[177] whatever he might be carrying from his son-in-law, Proitos.[178] Then after he had been given his son-in-law’s wicked symbols[179] first he sent him away with orders to kill the Chimaira[180] none might approach; a thing of immortal make, not human,[181] lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle,[182] and snorting out the breath of the terrible flame of bright fire.[183] He killed the Chimaira, obeying the portents of the immortals.[184] Next after this he fought against the glorious Solymoi,[185] and this he thought was the strongest battle with men that he entered;[186] but third he slaughtered the Amazons, who fight men in battle.[187] Now as he came back the king spun another entangling[188] treachery; for choosing the bravest men in wide Lykia[189] he laid a trap, but these men never came home thereafter[190] since all of them were killed by blameless Bellerophontes.[191] Then when the king knew him for the powerful stock of the god,[192] he detained him there, and offered him the hand of his daughter,[193] and gave him half of all the kingly privilege. Thereto[194] the men of Lykia cut out a piece of land, surpassing[195] all others, fine ploughland and orchard for him to administer.[196] His bride bore three children to valiant Bellerophontes,[197] Isandros and Hippolochos and Laodameia.[198] Laodameia lay in love beside Zeus of the counsels[199] and bore him godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helmet.[200] But after Bellerophontes was hated by all the immortals,[201] he wandered alone about the plain of Aleios, eating[202] his heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of humanity.[203] As for Isandros his son, Ares the insatiate of fighting[204] killed him in close battle against the glorious Solymoi,  p 71  [205] while Artemis of the golden reins killed the daughter in anger.[206] But Hippolochos begot me, and I claim that he is my father;[207] he sent me to Troy, and urged upon me repeated injunctions,[208] to be always among the bravest, and hold my head above others,[209] not shaming the generation of my fathers, who were[210] the greatest men in Ephyre and again in wide Lykia.[211] Such is my generation and the blood I claim to be born from.”[212] He spoke, and Diomedes of the great war cry was gladdened.[213] He drove his spear deep into the prospering earth, and in winning[214] words of friendliness he spoke to the shepherd of the people:[215] “See now, you are my guest friend from far in the time of our fathers.[216] Brilliant Oineus once was host to Bellerophontes[217] the blameless, in his halls, and twenty days he detained him,[218] and these two gave to each other fine gifts in token of friendship.[219] Oineus gave his guest a war belt bright with the red dye,[220] Bellerophontes a golden and double-handled drinking-cup,[221] a thing I left behind in my house when I came on my journey.[222] Tydeus, though, I cannot remember, since I was little[223] when he left me, that time the people of the Achaians perished[224] in Thebe. Therefore I am your friend and host in the heart of Argos;[225] you are mine in Lykia, when I come to your country.[226] Let us avoid each other’s spears, even in the close fighting.[227] There are plenty of Trojans and famed companions in battle for me[228] to kill, whom the god sends me, or those I run down with my swift feet,[229] many Achaians for you to slaughter, if you can do it.[230] But let us exchange our armour, so that these others may know[231] how we claim to be guests and friends from the days of our fathers.”[232] So they spoke, and both springing down from behind their horses[233] gripped each other’s hands and exchanged the promise of friendship;[234] but Zeus the son of Kronos stole away the wits of Glaukos[235] who exchanged with Diomedes the son of Tydeus armour[236] of gold for bronze, for nine oxen’s worth the worth of a hundred.[237] Now as Hektor had come to the Skaian gates and the oak tree,[238] all the wives of the Trojans and their daughters came running about him[239] to ask after their sons, after their brothers and neighbours,[240] their husbands; and he told them to pray to the immortals,[241] all, in turn; but there were sorrows in store for many.[242] Now he entered the wonderfully built palace of Priam.[243] This was fashioned with smooth-stone cloister walks, and within it[244] were embodied fifty sleeping chambers of smoothed stone[245] built so as to connect with each other; and within these slept[246] each beside his own wedded wife, the sons of Priam.[247] In the same inner court on the opposite side, to face these,[248] lay the twelve close smooth-stone sleeping chambers of his daughters[249] built so as to connect with each other; and within these slept,[250] each by his own modest wife, the lords of the daughters of Priam.[251] There there came to meet Hektor his bountiful mother[252] with Laodike, the loveliest looking of all her daughters.[253] She clung to his hand and called him by name and spoke to him: “Why then,[254] child, have you come here and left behind the bold battle?[255] Surely it is these accursed sons of the Achaians who wear you[256] out, as they fight close to the city, and the spirit stirred you[257] to return, and from the peak of the citadel lift your hands, praying  p 72  [258] to Zeus. But stay while I bring you honey-sweet wine, to pour out[259] a libation to father Zeus and the other immortals[260] first, and afterwards if you will drink yourself, be strengthened.[261] In a tired man, wine will bring back his strength to its bigness,[262] in a man tired as you are tired, defending your neighbours.”[263] Tall Hektor of the shining helm spoke to her answering:[264] “My honoured mother, lift not to me the kindly sweet wine,[265] for fear you stagger my strength and make me forget my courage;[266] and with hands unwashed I would take shame to pour the glittering[267] wine to Zeus; there is no means for a man to pray to the dark-misted[268] son of Kronos, with blood and muck all spattered upon him.[269] But go yourself to the temple of the spoiler Athene,[270] assembling the ladies of honour, and with things to be sacrificed,[271] and take a robe, which seems to you the largest and loveliest[272] in the great house, and that which is far your dearest possession.[273] Lay this along the knees of Athene the lovely haired. Also[274] promise to dedicate within the shrine twelve heifers,[275] yearlings, never broken, if only she will have pity[276] on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children,[277] if she will hold back from sacred Ilion the son of Tydeus,[278] that wild spear-fighter, the strong one who drives men to thoughts of terror.[279] So go yourself to the temple of the spoiler Athene,[280] while I go in search of Paris, to call him, if he will listen[281] to anything I tell him. How I wish at this moment the earth might[282] open beneath him. The Olympian let him live, a great sorrow[283] to the Trojans, and high-hearted Priam, and all of his children.[284] If only I could see him gone down to the house of the Death God,[285] then I could say my heart had forgotten its joyless affliction.”[286] So he spoke, and she going into the great house called out[287] to her handmaidens, who assembled throughout the city the highborn[288] women; while she descended into the fragrant store-chamber.[289] There lay the elaborately wrought robes, the work of Sidonian[290] women, whom Alexandros himself, the godlike, had brought home[291] from the land of Sidon, crossing the wide sea, on that journey[292] when he brought back also gloriously descended Helen.[293] Hekabe lifted out one and took it as gift to Athene,[294] that which was the loveliest in design and the largest,[295] and shone like a star. It lay beneath the others. She went on[296] her way, and a throng of noble women hastened about her.[297] When these had come to Athene’s temple on the peak of the citadel,[298] Theano of the fair cheeks opened the door for them, daughter[299] of Kisseus, and wife of Antenor, breaker of horses,[300] she whom the Trojans had established to be Athene’s priestess.[301] With a wailing cry all lifted up their hands to Athene,[302] and Theano of the fair cheeks taking up the robe laid it[303] along the knees of Athene the lovely haired, and praying[304] she supplicated the daughter of powerful Zeus: “O lady,[305] Athene, our city’s defender, shining among goddesses:[306] break the spear of Diomedes, and grant that the man be[307] hurled on his face in front of the Skaian gates; so may we[308] instantly dedicate within your shrine twelve heifers,[309] yearlings, never broken, if only you will have pity[310] on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children.”  p 73  [311] She spoke in prayer, but Pallas Athene turned her head from her.[312] So they made their prayer to the daughter of Zeus the powerful.[313] But Hektor went away to the house of Alexandros,[314] a splendid place he had built himself, with the men who at that time[315] were the best men for craftsmanship in the generous Troad,[316] who had made him a sleeping room and a hall and a courtyard[317] near the houses of Hektor and Priam, on the peak of the citadel.[318] There entered Hektor beloved of Zeus, in his hand holding[319] the eleven-cubit-long spear, whose shaft was tipped with a shining[320] bronze spearhead, and a ring of gold was hooped to hold it.[321] He found the man in his chamber busy with his splendid armour,[322] the corselet and the shield, and turning in his hands the curved bow,[323] while Helen of Argos was sitting among her attendant women[324] directing the magnificent work done by her handmaidens.[325] But Hektor saw him, and in words of shame he rebuked him:[326] “Strange man! It is not fair to keep in your heart this coldness.[327] The people are dying around the city and around the steep wall[328] as they fight hard; and it is for you that this war with its clamour[329] has flared up about our city. You yourself would fight with another[330] whom you saw anywhere hanging back from the hateful encounter.[331] Up then, to keep our town from burning at once in the hot fire.”[332] Then in answer the godlike Alexandros spoke to him:[333] “Hektor, seeing you have scolded me rightly, not beyond measure,[334] therefore I will tell, and you in turn understand and listen.[335] It was not so much in coldness and bitter will toward the Trojans[336] that I sat in my room, but I wished to give myself over to sorrow.[337] But just now with soft words my wife was winning me over[338] and urging me into the fight, and that way seems to me also[339] the better one. Victory passes back and forth between men.[340] Come then, wait for me now while I put on my armour of battle,[341] or go, and I will follow, and I think I can overtake you.”[342] He spoke, but Hektor of the shining helm gave him no answer,[343] but Helen spoke to him in words of endearment: “Brother[344] by marriage to me, who am a nasty bitch evil-intriguing,[345] how I wish that on that day when my mother first bore me[346] the foul whirlwind of the storm had caught me away and swept me[347] to the mountain, or into the wash of the sea deep-thundering[348] where the waves would have swept me away before all these things had happened.[349] Yet since the gods had brought it about that these vile things must be,[350] I wish I had been the wife of a better man than this is,[351] one who knew modesty and all things of shame that men say.[352] But this man’s heart is no steadfast thing, nor yet will it be so[353] ever hereafter; for that I think he shall take the consequence.[354] But come now, come in and rest on this chair, my brother,[355] since it is on your heart beyond all that the hard work has fallen[356] for the sake of dishonoured me and the blind act of Alexandros,[357] us two, on whom Zeus set a vile destiny, so that hereafter[358] we shall be made into things of song for the men of the future.”[359] Then tall Hektor of the shining helm answered her: “Do not, Helen,[360] make me sit with you, though you love me. You will not persuade me.[361] Already my heart within is hastening me to defend[362] the Trojans, who when I am away long greatly to have me.  p 74  [363] Rather rouse this man, and let himself also be swift to action[364] so he may overtake me while I am still in the city.[365] For I am going first to my own house, so I can visit[366] my own people, my beloved wife and my son, who is little,[367] since I do not know if ever again I shall come back this way,[368] or whether the gods will strike me down at the hands of the Achaians.”[369] So speaking Hektor of the shining helm departed[370] and in speed made his way to his own well-established dwelling,[371] but failed to find in the house Andromache of the white arms;[372] for she, with the child, and followed by one fair-robed attendant,[373] had taken her place on the tower in lamentation, and tearful.[374] When he saw no sign of his perfect wife within the house, Hektor[375] stopped in his way on the threshold and spoke among the handmaidens:[376] “Come then, tell me truthfully as you may, handmaidens:[377] where has Andromache of the white arms gone? Is she[378] with any of the sisters of her lord or the wives of his brothers?[379] Or has she gone to the house of Athene, where all the other[380] lovely-haired women of Troy propitiate the grim goddess?”[381] Then in turn the hard-working housekeeper gave him an answer:[382] “Hektor, since you have urged me to tell you the truth, she is not[383] with any of the sisters of her lord or the wives of his brothers,[384] nor has she gone to the house of Athene, where all the other[385] lovely-haired women of Troy propitiate the grim goddess,[386] but she has gone to the great bastion of Ilion, because she heard that[387] the Trojans were losing, and great grew the strength of the Achaians.[388] Therefore she has gone in speed to the wall, like a woman[389] gone mad, and a nurse attending her carries the baby.”[390] So the housekeeper spoke, and Hektor hastened from his home[391] backward by the way he had come through the well-laid streets. So[392] as he had come to the gates on his way through the great city,[393] the Skaian gates, whereby he would issue into the plain, there[394] at last his own generous wife came running to meet him,[395] Andromache, the daughter of high-heated Eëtion;[396] Eëtion, who had dwelt underneath wooded Plakos,[397] in Thebe below Plakos, lord over the Kilikian people.[398] It was his daughter who was given to Hektor of the bronze helm.[399] She came to him there, and beside her went an attendant carrying[400] the boy in the fold of her bosom, a little child, only a baby,[401] Hektor’s son, the admired, beautiful as a star shining,[402] whom Hektor called Skamandrios, but all of the others[403] Astyanax—lord of the city; since Hektor alone saved Ilion.[404] Hektor smiled in silence as he looked on his son, but she,[405] Andromache, stood close beside him, letting her tears fall,[406] and clung to his hand and called him by name and spoke to him: “Dearest,[407] your own great strength will be your death, and you have no pity[408] on your little son, nor on me, ill-starred, who soon must be your widow;[409] for presently the Achaians, gathering together,[410] will set upon you and kill you; and for me it would be far better[411] to sink into the earth when I have lost you, for there is no other[412] consolation for me after you have gone to your destiny—[413] only grief; since I have no father, no honoured mother.[414] It was brilliant Achilleus who slew my father, Eëtion,[415] when he stormed the strong-founded citadel of the Kilikians,  p 75  [416] Thebe of the towering gates. He killed Eëtion[417] but did not strip his armour, for his heart respected the dead man,[418] but burned the body in all its elaborate war-gear[419] and piled a grave mound over it, and the nymphs of the mountains,[420] daughters of Zeus of the aegis, planted elm trees about it.[421] And they who were my seven brothers in the great house all went[422] upon a single day down into the house of the death god,[423] for swift-footed brilliant Achilleus slaughtered all of them[424] as they were tending their white sheep and their lumbering oxen;[425] and when he had led my mother, who was queen under wooded Plakos,[426] here, along with all his other possessions, Achilleus[427] released her again, accepting ransom beyond count, but Artemis[428] of the showering arrows struck her down in the halls of her father.[429] Hektor, thus you are father to me, and my honoured mother,[430] you are my brother, and you it is who are my young husband.[431] Please take pity upon me then, stay here on the rampart,[432] that you may not leave your child an orphan, your wife a widow,[433] but draw your people up by the fig tree, there where the city[434] is openest to attack, and where the wall may be mounted.[435] Three times their bravest came that way, and fought there to storm it[436] about the two Aiantes and renowned Idomeneus,[437] about the two Atreidai and the fighting son of Tydeus.[438] Either some man well skilled in prophetic arts had spoken,[439] or the very spirit within themselves had stirred them to the onslaught.”[440] Then tall Hektor of the shining helm answered her: “All these[441] things are in my mind also, lady; yet I would feel deep shame[442] before the Trojans, and Trojan women with trailing garments,[443] if like a coward I were to shrink aside from the fighting;[444] and the spirit will not let me, since I have learned to be valiant[445] and to fight always among the foremost ranks of the Trojans,[446] winning for my own self great glory, and for my father.[447] For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it:[448] there will come a day when sacred Ilion shall perish,[449] and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear.[450] But it is not so much the pain to come of the Trojans[451] that troubles me, not even of Priam the king nor Hekabe,[452] not the thought of my brothers who in their numbers and valour[453] shall drop in the dust under the hands of men who hate them,[454] as troubles me the thought of you, when some bronze-armoured[455] Achaian leads you off, taking away your day of liberty,[456] in tears; and in Argos you must work at the loom of another,[457] and carry water from the spring Messeis or Hypereia,[458] all unwilling, but strong will be the necessity upon you;[459] and some day seeing you shedding tears a man will say of you:[460] ‘This is the wife of Hektor, who was ever the bravest fighter[461] of the Trojans, breakers of horses, in the days when they fought about Ilion.’[462] So will one speak of you; and for you it will be yet a fresh grief,[463] to be widowed of such a man who could fight off the day of your slavery.[464] But may I be dead and the piled earth hide me under before I[465] hear you crying and know by this that they drag you captive.”[466] So speaking glorious Hektor held out his arms to his baby,[467] who shrank back to his fair-girdled nurse’s bosom  p 76  [468] screaming, and frightened at the aspect of his own father,[469] terrified as he saw the bronze and the crest with its horse-hair,[470] nodding dreadfully, as he thought, from the peak of the helmet.[471] Then his beloved father laughed out, and his honoured mother,[472] and at once glorious Hektor lifted from his head the helmet[473] and laid it in all its shining upon the ground. Then taking[474] up his dear son he tossed him about in his arms, and kissed him,[475] and lifted his voice in prayer to Zeus and the other immortals:[476] “Zeus, and you other immortals, grant that this boy, who is my son,[477] may be as I am, pre-eminent among the Trojans,[478] great in strength, as am I, and rule strongly over Ilion;[479] and some day let them say of him: ‘He is better by far than his father,’[480] as he comes in from the fighting; and let him kill his enemy[481] and bring home the blooded spoils, and delight the heart of his mother.”[482] So speaking he set his child again in the arms of his beloved[483] wife, who took him back again to her fragrant bosom[484] smiling in her tears; and her husband saw, and took pity upon her,[485] and stroked her with his hand, and called her by name and spoke to her:[486] “Poor Andromache! Why does your heart sorrow so much for me?[487] No man is going to hurl me to Hades, unless it is fated,[488] but as for fate, I think that no man yet has escaped it[489] once it has taken its first form, neither brave man nor coward.[490] Go therefore back to our house, and take up your own work,[491] the loom and the distaff, and see to it that your handmaidens[492] ply their work also; but the men must see to the fighting,[493] all men who are the people of Ilion, but I beyond others.”[494] So glorious Hektor spoke and again took up the helmet[495] with its crest of horse-hair, while his beloved wife went homeward,[496] turning to look back on the way, letting the live tears fall.[497] And as she came in speed into the well-settled household[498] of Hektor the slayer of men, she found numbers of handmaidens[499] within, and her coming stirred all of them into lamentation.[500] So they mourned in his house over Hektor while he was living[501] still, for they thought he would never again come back from the fighting[502] alive, escaping the Achaian hands and their violence.[503] But Paris in turn did not linger long in his high house,[504] but when he had put on his glorious armour with bronze elaborate[505] he ran in the confidence of his quick feet through the city.[506] As when some stalled horse who has been corn-fed at the manger[507] breaking free of his rope gallops over the plain in thunder[508] to his accustomed bathing place in a sweet-running river[509] and in the pride of his strength holds high his head, and the mane floats[510] over his shoulders; sure of his glorious strength, the quick knees[511] carry him to the loved places and the pasture of horses;[512] so from uttermost Pergamos came Paris, the son of[513] Priam, shining in all his armour of war as the sun shines,[514] laughing aloud, and his quick feet carried him; suddenly thereafter[515] he came on brilliant Hektor, his brother, where he yet lingered[516] before turning away from the place where he had talked with his lady.[517] It was Alexandros the godlike who first spoke to him:[518] “Brother, I fear that I have held back your haste, by being[519] slow on the way, not coming in time, as you commanded me.”[520] Then tall Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him in answer:  p 77  [521] “Strange man! There is no way that one, giving judgment in fairness,[522] could dishonour your work in battle, since you are a strong man.[523] But of your own accord you hang back, unwilling. And my heart[524] is grieved in its thought, when I hear shameful things spoken about you[525] by the Trojans, who undergo hard fighting for your sake.[526] Let us go now; some day hereafter we will make all right[527] with the immortal gods in the sky, if Zeus ever grant it,[528] setting up to them in our houses the wine-bowl of liberty[529] after we have driven out of Troy the strong-greaved Achaians.”book seven[1] So speaking Hektor the glorious swept on through the gates,[2] and with him went Alexandros his brother, both of them minded[3] in their hearts to do battle and take their part in the fighting.[4] And as to men of the sea in their supplication the god sends[5] a fair wind, when they are breaking their strength at the smoothed oar-sweeps,[6] driving over the sea, and their arms are weak with weariness,[7] so these two appeared to the Trojans, who had longed for them.[8] Each killed his man: Paris, the son of lord Areïthoös,[9] Menesthios, who lived in Arne, born to him of the war club[10] Areïthoös, and to ox-eyed Phylomedousa;[11] while Hektor with the sharp spear struck Eïoneus, under[12] the circle of the bronze helm, in the neck, and broke his limbs’ strength.[13] And Glaukos, lord of the Lykian men, the son of Hippolochos,[14] struck down with the spear Iphinoös in the strong encounter,[15] Dexias’ son, as he leapt up behind his fast horses, striking him[16] in the shoulder. He dropped from car to ground, and his limb’s strength was broken.[17] Now as the goddess grey-eyed Athene was aware of these two[18] destroying the men of Argos in the strong encounter,[19] she went down in a flash of speed from the peaks of Olympos[20] to sacred Ilion, where Apollo stirred forth to meet her[21] from his seat on Pergamos, where he planned that the Trojans should conquer.[22] These two then encountered each other beside the oak tree,[23] and speaking first the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, addressed her:[24] “What can be your desire this time, o daughter of great Zeus,[25] that you came down from Olympos at the urge of your mighty spirit?[26] To give the Danaans victory in the battle, turning it[27] back? Since you have no pity at all for the Trojans who are dying.[28] But if you might only do as I say, it would be far better.[29] For this day let us put an end to the hatred and the fighting[30] now; they shall fight again hereafter, till we witness the finish[31] they make of Ilion, since it is dear to the heart of you, who[32] are goddesses immortal, that this city shall be made desolate.”[33] Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:[34] “Worker from afar, thus let it be. These were my thoughts also[35] as I came down from Olympos among the Achaians and Trojans.[36] Tell me then, how are you minded to stop these men in their fighting?”  p 78  [37] Now in turn the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, addressed her:[38] “Let us rouse up the strong heart in Hektor, breaker of horses,[39] if he might call forth some Danaan to do battle against him,[40] single man against single man, in bitter combat;[41] and let the strong-greaved Achaians, stirred into admiration,[42] send forth a single man to do battle with brilliant Hektor.”[43] He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess grey-eyed Athene.[44] Now Helenos, Priam’s beloved son, gathered into his heart their[45] deliberation, and all that pleased the musing divinities.[46] He went on his way and stood beside Hektor and spoke a word to him:[47] “Hektor, o son of Priam and equal of Zeus in counsel,[48] would you now be persuaded by me, for I am your brother?[49] Make the rest of the Trojans sit down, and all the Achaians,[50] and yourself call forth one of the Achaians, their bravest,[51] to fight man to man against you in bitter combat.[52] Since it is not your destiny yet to die and encounter[53] fate. For thus I heard it in the speech of the gods everlasting.”[54] So he spoke, and Hektor hearing his word was happy,[55] and went into the space between and forced back the Trojan battalions,[56] holding his spear by the middle, until they were all seated,[57] while Agamemnon in turn seated the strong-greaved Achaians,[58] and Athene and the lord of the silver bow, Apollo,[59] assuming the likenesses of birds, of vultures, settled[60] aloft the great oak tree of their father, Zeus of the aegis,[61] taking their ease and watching these men whose ranks, dense-settled,[62] shuddered into a bristle of spears, of shields and of helmets.[63] As when the shudder of the west wind suddenly rising[64] scatters across the water, and the water darkens beneath it,[65] so darkening were settled the ranks of Achaians and Trojans[66] in the plain. And now Hektor spoke forth between them:[67] “Listen to me, you Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians,[68] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[69] Zeus, son of Kronos, who sits on high, would not bring to fulfilment[70] our oaths, but is found to be of evil intention toward both sides[71] until that day when you storm Troy of the strong towers, or that day[72] when you yourselves are broken beside your seafaring vessels.[73] Seeing now that among you are the bravest of all the Achaians,[74] let one of you, whose heart stirs him to combat against me,[75] stand forth before all to fight by himself against brilliant Hektor.[76] Behold the terms that I make, let Zeus be witness upon them.[77] If with the thin edge of the bronze he takes my life, then[78] let him strip my armour and carry it back to the hollow ships,[79] but give my body to be taken home again, so that the Trojans[80] and the wives of the Trojans may give me in death my rite of burning.[81] But if I take his life, and Apollo grants me the glory,[82] I will strip his armour and carry it to sacred Ilion[83] and hang it in front of the temple of far-striking Apollo,[84] but his corpse I will give back among the strong-benched vessels[85] so that the flowing-haired Achaians may give him due burial[86] and heap up a mound upon him beside the broad passage of Helle.[87] And some day one of the men to come will say, as he sees it,[88] one who in his benched ship sails on the wine-blue water:  p 79  [89] ‘This is the mound of a man who died long ago in battle,[90] who was one of the bravest, and glorious Hektor killed him.’[91] So will he speak some day, and my glory will not be forgotten.”[92] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence[93] in shame of refusing him, and in fear to take up his challenge.[94] But now at long last Menelaos stood forth and addressed them[95] in scorn and reproach, and stirred within the heart to great sorrow:[96] “Ah me! You brave in words, you women, not men, of Achaia![97] This will be a defilement upon us, shame upon shame piled,[98] if no one of the Danaans goes out to face Hektor.[99] No, may all of you turn to water and earth, all of you[100] who sit by yourselves with no life in you, utterly dishonoured.[101] I myself will arm against this man. While above us[102] the threads of victory are held in the hands of the immortals.”[103] So he spoke, and began to put on his splendid armour.[104] And there, o Menelaos, would have shown forth the end of your life[105] under the hands of Hektor, since he was far stronger than you were,[106] had not the kings of the Achaians leapt up and caught you;[107] and the son of Atreus himself, powerful Agamemnon,[108] caught you by the right hand, and called you by name, and spoke to you:[109] “Menelaos, beloved of God, you are mad; you have no need[110] to take leave of your senses thus. Hold fast, though it hurts you,[111] nor long in your pride to fight with a man who is better than you are,[112] with Hektor, Priam’s son. There are others who shudder before him.[113] Even Achilleus, in the fighting where men win glory,[114] trembles to meet this man, and he is far better than you are.[115] Go back now and sit down in the throng of your own companions;[116] the Achaians will set up another to fight against this man,[117] and even though he is without fear, and can never be glutted[118] with rough work, I think he will be glad to leave off, even[119] if he comes off whole from the hateful fighting and bitter combat.”[120] The hero spoke like this and bent the heart of his brother[121] since he urged wisely. And Menelaos obeyed him; his henchmen[122] joyfully thereupon took off the armour from his shoulders.[123] Nestor among the Argives now stood forth and addressed them:[124] “Oh, for shame. Great sorrow settles on the land of Achaia.[125] Surely he would groan aloud, Peleus, the aged horseman,[126] the great man of counsel among the Myrmidons, and their speaker.[127] Once, as he questioned me in his house, he was filled with great joy[128] as he heard the generation and blood of all of the Argives.[129] Now if he were to hear how all cringe away before Hektor,[130] many a time he would lift up his very hands to the immortals,[131] and the life breath from his limbs would go down into the house of Hades.[132] If only, o father Zeus, Athene, Apollo,[133] I were in my youth as when the Pylians assembled[134] and the spear-fighting Arkadians battled by swirling Keladon,[135] by the streams of Iardanos and before the ramparts of Pheia.[136] Their champion stood forth, Ereuthalion, a man godlike,[137] wearing upon his shoulders the armour of lord Areïthoös,[138] Areïthoös the brilliant, given by the men of that time[139] and the fair-girdled women the name club-fighter, because he[140] went into battle armed neither with the bow nor the long spear,  p 80  [141] but with a great bar clubbed of iron broke the battalions.[142] Lykourgos killed this man by craft, not strength, for he met him[143] in the narrow pass of the way, where the iron club served not to parry[144] destruction, for Lykourgos, too quick with a stab beneath it,[145] pinned him through the middle with the spear, so he went down backward[146] to the ground; and he stripped the armour brazen Ares had given him[147] and wore the armour thereafter himself through the grind of battle.[148] But when Lykourgos was grown an old man in his halls, he gave it[149] to his beloved henchman, Ereuthalion, to carry.[150] Wearing this armour he called forth all the bravest to fight him,[151] but they were all afraid and trembling: none had the courage,[152] only I, for my hard-enduring heart in its daring[153] drove me to fight him. I in age was the youngest of all of them.[154] And I fought with him, and Pallas Athene gave me the glory.[155] Of all the men I have killed this was the tallest and strongest.[156] For he sprawled in his great bulk this way and that way. If only[157] I were young now, as then, and the strength still steady within me;[158] Hektor of the glancing helm would soon find his battle.[159] But you, now, who are the bravest of all the Achaians,[160] are not minded with a good will to go against Hektor.”[161] So the old man scolded them, and nine in all stood forth.[162] Far the first to rise up was the lord of men, Agamemnon,[163] and rose after him the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,[164] and next the two Aiantes rose, their fierce strength upon them,[165] and after these Idomeneus, and Idomeneus’ companion,[166] Meriones, a match for the murderous Lord of Battles,[167] and after these Eurypylos, the glorious son of Euaimon,[168] and Thoas rose up, Andraimon’s son, and brilliant Odysseus.[169] All of these were willing to fight against brilliant Hektor.[170] Now before them again spoke the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:[171] “Let the lot be shaken for all of you, to see who wins it.[172] He shall be the one to gladden the strong-greaved Achaians,[173] and to be glad within his own heart, if he can come off[174] whole again from the hateful battle and bitter combat.”[175] So he spoke, and each of them marked a lot as his own one lot.[176] They threw them in the helmet of Atreus’ son, Agamemnon.[177] and the people, holding up their hands to the gods, prayed to them.[178] Then would murmur any man, gazing into the wide sky:[179] “Father Zeus, let Aias win the lot, or else Diomedes,[180] Tydeus’ son, or the king himself of golden Mykenai.”[181] So they spoke, and Nestor the Gerenian horseman shook the lots,[182] and a lot leapt from the helmet, that one that they all had wished for,[183] the lot of Aias; and a herald carrying it all through the great throng[184] showed it from left to right to the great men of the Achaians,[185] all of them. Each man knew not the mark, and denied it,[186] but as carrying it all through the great throng he showed it to that one[187] who had marked it as his, and thrown it in the helmet, glorious Aias,[188] he held forth his hand, and the herald stood by him, and put the lot in it,[189] and he saw his mark on the lot, and knew it, and his heart was gladdened.[190] He threw it down on the ground beside his foot, and spoke to them:[191] “See, friends, the lot is mine, and I myself am made happy[192] in my heart, since I think I can win over brilliant Hektor.  p 81  [193] Do this, then: while I put on my armour of fighting,[194] all of you be praying to the lord Zeus, the son of Kronos,[195] in silence and each to himself, let none of the Trojans hear you;[196] or openly out loud, since we have nothing to be afraid of[197] at all, since no man by force will beat me backward unwilling[198] as he wills, nor by craft either, since I think that the man who was born[199] and raised in Salamis, myself, is not such a novice.”[200] So he spoke, and they prayed to the lord Zeus, the son of Kronos.[201] And then would murmur any man, gazing into the wide sky:[202] “Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,[203] grant that Aias win the vaunt of renown and the victory;[204] but if truly you love Hektor and are careful for him,[205] give to both of them equal strength, make equal their honour.”[206] So they spoke, and meanwhile Aias armed him in shining[207] bronze. Then when he had girt his body in all its armour,[208] he strode on his way, as Ares the war god walks gigantic[209] going into the fighting of men whom the son of Kronos[210] has driven to fight angrily in heart-perishing hatred.[211] Such was Aias as he strode gigantic, the wall of the Achaians,[212] smiling under his threatening brows, with his feet beneath him[213] taking huge strides forward, and shaking the spear far-shadowing.[214] And the Argives looking upon him were made glad, while the Trojans[215] were taken every man in the knees with trembling and terror,[216] and for Hektor himself the heart beat hard in his breast, but he could not[217] any more find means to take flight and shrink back into[218] the throng of his men, since he in his pride had called him to battle.[219] Now Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield[220] of bronze and sevenfold ox-hide which Tychios wrought him with much toil;[221] Tychios, at home in Hyle, far the best of all workers in leather[222] who had made him the great gleaming shield of sevenfold ox-hide[223] from strong bulls, and hammered an eighth fold of bronze upon it.[224] Telamonian Aias, carrying this to cover[225] his chest, came near to Hektor and spoke to him in words of menace:[226] “Hektor, single man against single man you will learn now[227] for sure what the bravest men are like among the Danaans[228] even after Achilleus the lion-hearted who breaks men in battle.[229] He lies now apart among his own beaked seafaring[230] ships, in anger at Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people.[231] But here are we; and we are such men as can stand up against you;[232] there are plenty of us; so now begin your fight and your combat.”[233] Tall Hektor of the glancing helm answered him: “Aias,[234] son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, o lord of the people,[235] do not be testing me as if I were some ineffectual[236] boy, or a woman, who knows nothing of the works of warfare.[237] I know well myself how to fight and kill men in battle;[238] I know how to turn to the right, how to turn to the left the ox-hide[239] tanned into a shield which is my protection in battle;[240] I know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses;[241] I know how to tread my measures on the grim floor of the war god.[242] Yet great as you are I would not strike you by stealth, watching[243] for my chance, but openly, so, if perhaps I might hit you.”  p 82  [244] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,[245] and struck the sevenfold-ox-hide terrible shield of Aias[246] in the uttermost bronze, which was the eighth layer upon it,[247] and the unwearying bronze spearhead shore its way through six folds[248] but was stopped in the seventh ox-hide. Then after him Aias[249] the illustrious in turn cast with his spear far-shadowing[250] and struck the shield of Priam’s son on its perfect circle.[251] All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead,[252] and crashed its way through the intricately worked corselet;[253] straight ahead by the flank the spearhead shore through his tunic,[254] yet he bent away to one side and avoided the dark death.[255] Both now gripping in their hands the long spears pulled them[256] out, and went at each other like lions who live on raw meat,[257] or wild boars, whose strength is no light thing. The son of[258] Priam stabbed then with his spear into the shield’s centre,[259] nor did the bronze point break its way through, but the spearhead bent back.[260] Now Aias plunging upon him thrust at the shield, and the spearhead[261] passed clean through, and pounded Hektor back in his fury,[262] and tore at his neck passing so that the dark blood broke. Yet[263] even so Hektor of the shining helmet did not stop fighting,[264] but gave back and in his heavy hand caught up a stone that[265] lay in the plain, black and rugged and huge. With this[266] he struck the sevenfold-ox-hide terrible shield of Aias[267] in the knob of the centre so that the bronze clashed loud about it.[268] After him Aias in turn lifting a stone far greater[269] whirled it and threw, leaning into the cast his strength beyond measure,[270] and the shield broke inward under the stroke of the rock like a millstone,[271] and Hektor’s very knees gave, so that he sprawled backward,[272] shield beaten upon him, but at once Apollo lifted him upright.[273] And now they would have been stabbing with their swords at close quarters,[274] had not the heralds, messengers of Zeus and of mortals,[275] come up, one for the bronze-armoured Achaians, one for the Trojans,[276] Idaios and Talthybios, both men of good counsel.[277] They held their staves between the two men, and the herald Idaios[278] out of his knowledge of prudent advices spoke a word to them:[279] “Stop the fight, dear children, nor go on with this battle.[280] To Zeus who gathers the clouds both of you are beloved,[281] and both of you are fighters; this thing all of us know surely.[282] Night darkens now. It is a good thing to give way to the night-time.”[283] Aias the son of Telamon spoke to him in answer:[284] “Bid Hektor answer this, Idaios, since it was he who[285] in his pride called forth all our bravest to fight him.[286] Let him speak first; and I for my part shall do as he urges.”[287] Tall Hektor of the glancing helm answered him: “Aias,[288] seeing that God has given you strength, stature and wisdom[289] also, and with the spear you surpass the other Achaians,[290] let us now give over this fighting and hostility[291] for today; we shall fight again, until the divinity[292] chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.[293] Night darkens now. It is a good thing to give way to the night-time.[294] Thus you may bring joy to all the Achaians beside their[295] ships, and above all to those who are your own kindred and company;  p 83  [296] and I in the great city of lord Priam will gladden[297] the Trojans, and the women of Troy with their trailing robes, who[298] will go before the divine assembly in thanksgiving for my sake.[299] Come then, let us give each other glorious presents,[300] so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us:[301] ‘These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then[302] joined with each other in close friendship, before they were parted.’ ”[303] So he spoke, and bringing a sword with nails of silver[304] gave it to him, together with the sheath and the well-cut sword belt,[305] and Aias gave a war belt coloured shining with purple.[306] So separating, Aias went among the Achaian people,[307] and Hektor went back to the thronging Trojans, who were made happy[308] when they saw him coming alive and unwounded out of the combat,[309] escaping the strength and the unconquerable hands of Aias,[310] and they, who had not hoped to see him alive, escorted him[311] back to the town. On the other side the strong-greaved Achaians[312] led Aias, happy in his victory, to great Agamemnon.[313] When these had come to the shelters of the son of Atreus,[314] Agamemnon the lord of men dedicated an ox among them,[315] a five-year-old male, to Zeus, all-powerful son of Kronos.[316] They skinned the victim and put it in order, and butchered the carcass,[317] and cut up the meat expertly into small pieces, and spitted them,[318] and roasted all carefully, and took off the pieces.[319] Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready,[320] they feasted, nor was any man’s hunger denied a fair portion;[321] and Atreus’ son, the hero wide-ruling Agamemnon,[322] gave to Aias in honour the long cuts of the chine’s portion.[323] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[324] the aged man began to weave his counsel before them[325] first, Nestor, whose advice had shown best before this.[326] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[327] “Son of Atreus, and you other great men of all the Achaians:[328] seeing that many flowing-haired Achaians have died here,[329] whose dark blood has been scattered beside the fair waters of Skamandros[330] by the fierce war god, while their souls went down into the house of Hades;[331] therefore with the dawn we should set a pause to the fighting[332] of Achaians, and assembling them wheel back the bodies[333] with mules and oxen; then must we burn them a little apart from[334] the ships, so that each whose duty it is may carry the bones back[335] to a man’s children, when we go home to the land of our fathers.[336] And let us gather and pile one single mound on the corpse-pyre[337] indiscriminately from the plain, and build fast upon it[338] towered ramparts, to be a defence of ourselves and our vessels.[339] And let us build into these walls gates strongly fitted[340] that there may be a way through them for the driving of horses;[341] and on the outer side, and close, we must dig a deep ditch[342] circling it, so as to keep off their people and horses,[343] that we may not be crushed under the attack of these proud Trojans.”[344] So he spoke, and all the kings gave him their approval.[345] Now there was an assembly of Trojans high on the city of Ilion[346] fiercely shaken to tumult before the doors of Priam,[347] and among these Antenor the thoughtful began to address them:  p 84  [348] “Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me[349] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[350] Come then: let us give back Helen of Argos and all her possessions[351] to the sons of Atreus to take away, seeing now we fight with[352] our true pledges made into lies; and I see no good thing’s[353] accomplishment for us in the end, unless we do this.”[354] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them rose up[355] brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,[356] who spoke to him in answer and addressed them in winged words:[357] “Antenor, these things that you argue please me no longer.[358] Your mind knows how to contrive a saying better than this one.[359] But if in all seriousness this is your true argument; then[360] it is the very gods who ruined the brain within you.[361] I will speak out before the Trojans, breakers of horses.[362] I refuse, straight out. I will not give back the woman.[363] But of the possessions I carried away to our house from Argos[364] I am willing to give all back, and to add to these from my own goods.”[365] He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them rose up[366] Priam, son of Dardanos, equal of the gods in counsel,[367] who in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[368] “Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me[369] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[370] Take now your supper about the city, as you did before this,[371] and remember your duty of the watch, and be each man wakeful;[372] and at dawn let Idaios go to the hollow ships, and speak with[373] the sons of Atreus, Menelaos and Agamemnon, giving[374] the word of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen,[375] and to add this solid message, and ask them if they are willing[376] to stop the sorrowful fighting until we can burn the bodies[377] of our dead. We shall fight again until the divinity[378] chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.”[379] So he spoke, and they listened to him with care, and obeyed him;[380] and so took their supper, watch succeeding watch, through the army.[381] Then at dawn Idaios went down to the hollow ships, where[382] he found the Danaans, henchmen of the war god, in assembly[383] beside the stern of Agamemnon’s ship; the herald[384] with the great voice took his stand in their midst, and spoke to them:[385] “Son of Atreus, and you other great men of all the Achaians,[386] Priam and the rest of the haughty Trojans have bidden me[387] give you, if this message be found to your pleasure and liking,[388] the word of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen.[389] All those possessions that Alexandros carried in his hollow[390] ships to Troy, and I wish that he had perished before then,[391] he is willing to give all back, and to add to these from his own goods.[392] But the very wedded wife of glorious Menelaos[393] he says that he will not give, though the Trojans would have him do it.[394] They told me to give you this message also, if you are willing;[395] to stop the sorrowful fighting until we can burn the bodies[396] of our dead. We shall fight again afterwards, until the divinity[397] chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.”[398] So he spoke, and all of them stayed quiet in silence;[399] but now at long last Diomedes of the great war cry addressed them:  p 85  [400] “Now let none accept the possessions of Alexandros,[401] nor take back Helen; one who is very simple can see it,[402] that by this time the terms of death hang over the Trojans.”[403] So he spoke, and all sons of the Achaians shouted[404] acclaim for the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses;[405] and now powerful Agamemnon spoke to Idaios:[406] “Idaios, you hear for yourself the word of the Achaians,[407] how they are answering you; and such is my pleasure also.[408] But about the burning of the dead bodies I do not begrudge you;[409] no, for there is no sparing time for the bodies of the perished,[410] once they have died, to give them swiftly the pity of burning.[411] Let Zeus, high-thundering lord of Hera, witness our pledges.”[412] He spoke, and held up the sceptre in the sight of all the gods. Then[413] Idaios made his way back once more to sacred Ilion.[414] The Trojans and Dardanians were in session of assembly,[415] all gathered in one place, awaiting Idaios when he might come[416] back; and he returned to them and delivered his message[417] standing there in their midst, and they made their swift preparations,[418] for two things, some to gather the bodies, and the others firewood;[419] while the Argives on the other side from their strong-benched vessels[420] went forward, some to gather the bodies, and others firewood.[421] Now the sun of a new day struck on the ploughlands, rising[422] out of the quiet water and the deep stream of the ocean[423] to climb the sky. The Trojans assembled together. They found[424] it hard to recognize each individual dead man;[425] but with water they washed away the blood that was on them[426] and as they wept warm tears they lifted them on to the wagons.[427] But great Priam would not let them cry out; and in silence[428] they piled the bodies upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,[429] and burned them upon the fire, and went back to sacred Ilion.[430] In the same way on the other side the strong-greaved Achaians[431] piled their own slain upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,[432] and burned them upon the fire, and went back to their hollow vessels.[433] But when the dawn was not yet, but still the pallor of night’s edge,[434] a chosen body of the Achaians formed by the pyre;[435] and they gathered together and piled one single mound all above it[436] indiscriminately from the plain, and built a fort on it[437] with towered ramparts, to be a defence for themselves and their vessels;[438] and they built within these walls gates strongly fitted[439] that there might be a way through them for the driving of horses;[440] and on the outer side and against it they dug a deep ditch,[441] making it great and wide, and fixed the sharp stakes inside it.[442] So the flowing-haired Achaians laboured, and meanwhile[443] the gods in session at the side of Zeus who handles the lightning[444] watched the huge endeavour of the bronze-armoured Achaians;[445] and the god Poseidon who shakes the earth began speaking among them:[446] “Father Zeus, is there any mortal left on the wide earth[447] who will still declare to the immortals his mind and his purpose?[448] Do you not see how now these flowing-haired Achaians[449] have built a wall landward of their ships, and driven about it[450] a ditch, and not given to the gods any grand sacrifice?[451] Now the fame of this will last as long as dawnlight is scattered,  p 86  [452] and men will forget that wall which I and Phoibos Apollo[453] built with our hard work for the hero Laomedon’s city.”[454] Deeply troubled, Zeus who gathers the clouds answered him:[455] “What a thing to have said, earth-shaker of the wide strength.[456] Some other one of the gods might fear such a thought, one who[457] is a god far weaker of his hands and in anger than you are;[458] but the fame of you shall last as long as dawnlight is scattered.[459] Come then! After once more the flowing-haired Achaians[460] are gone back with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,[461] break their wall to pieces and scatter it into the salt sea[462] and pile again the beach deep under the sands and cover it;[463] so let the great wall of the Achaians go down to destruction.”[464] As these two were talking thus together, the sun went[465] down, and the work of the Achaians was finished. They slaughtered[466] oxen then beside their shelters, and took their supper.[467] The ships came over to them from Lemnos bringing them wine, ships[468] sent over to them in numbers by the son of Jason, Euneos,[469] whom Hypsipyle had borne to the shepherd of the people, Jason.[470] Apart to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos,[471] Jason’s son had given wine as a gift, a thousand[472] measures; and thence the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians[473] bought wine, some for bronze and others for shining iron,[474] some for skins and some for the whole oxen, while others[475] paid slaves taken in war; and they made their feasting abundant.[476] All night long thereafter the flowing-haired Achaians[477] feasted, and the Trojans and their companions in arms in the city;[478] but all night long Zeus of the counsels was threatening evil[479] upon them in the terrible thunderstroke. Green fear took hold of them.[480] They spilled the wine on the ground from their cups, and none was so hardy[481] as to drink, till he had poured to the all-powerful son of Kronos.[482] They lay down thereafter and took the blessing of slumber.book eight[1] Now Dawn the yellow-robed scattered over all the earth. Zeus[2] who joys in the thunder made an assembly of all the immortals[3] upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos. There he[4] spoke to them himself, and the other divinities listened:[5] “Hear me, all you gods and all you goddesses: hear me[6] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[7] Now let no female divinity, nor male god either,[8] presume to cut across the way of my word, but consent to it[9] all of you, so that I can make an end in speed of these matters.[10] And any one I perceive against the gods’ will attempting[11] to go among the Trojans and help them, or among the Danaans,[12] he shall go whipped against his dignity back to Olympos;[13] or I shall take him and dash him down to the murk of Tartaros,[14] far below, where the uttermost depth of the pit lies under[15] earth, where there are gates of iron and a brazen doorstone,[16] as far beneath the house of Hades as from earth the sky lies.[17] Then he will see how far I am strongest of all the immortals.  p 87  [18] Come, you gods, make this endeavour, that you all may learn this.[19] Let down out of the sky a cord of gold; lay hold of it[20] all you who are gods and all who are goddesses, yet not[21] even so can you drag down Zeus from the sky to the ground, not[22] Zeus the high lord of counsel, though you try until you grow weary.[23] Yet whenever I might strongly be minded to pull you,[24] I could drag you up, earth and all and sea and all with you,[25] then fetch the golden rope about the horn of Olympos[26] and make it fast, so that all once more should dangle in mid air.[27] So much stronger am I than the gods, and stronger than mortals.”[28] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence,[29] stunned at his word, for indeed he had spoken to them very strongly.[30] But now at long last the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:[31] “Son of Kronos, our father, o lordliest of the mighty,[32] we know already your strength and how none can stand up against it.[33] Yet even so we are sorrowful for the Danaan spearmen[34] who must fill out an unhappy destiny, and perish.[35] Still we shall keep out of the fighting, as you command us;[36] yet we will put good counsel in the Argives; if it may help them,[37] so that not all of them will die because of your anger.”[38] Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds smiled at her and answered:[39] “Tritogeneia, dear daughter, do not lose heart; for I say this[40] not in outright anger, and my meaning toward you is kindly.”[41] He spoke, and under the chariot harnessed his bronze-shod horses,[42] flying-footed, with long manes streaming of gold; and he put on[43] clothing of gold about his own body, and took up the golden[44] lash, carefully compacted, and climbed up into his chariot,[45] and whipped them into a run, and they winged their way unreluctant[46] through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.[47] He came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,[48] to Gargaron, where was his holy ground and his smoking altar.[49] There the father of gods and of mortals halted his horses,[50] and slipped them from their harness, and drifted close mist about them,[51] and himself rejoicing in the pride of his strength sat down on the mountain[52] looking out over the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaians.[53] Now the flowing-haired Achaians had taken their dinner[54] lightly among their shelters, and they put on their armour thereafter;[55] and on the other side, in the city, the Trojans took up[56] their armour, fewer men, yet minded to stand the encounter[57] even so, caught in necessity, for their wives and their children.[58] And all the gates were made open, and the fighting men swept through them,[59] the foot ranks and the horsemen, and the sound grew huge of their onset.[60] Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,[61] they dashed their shields together and their spears, and the strength of[62] armoured men in bronze, and the shields massive in the middle[63] clashed against each other, and the sound grew huge of the fighting.[64] There the screaming and the shouts of triumph rose up together[65] of men killing and men killed, and the ground ran blood.[66] So long as it was early morning and the sacred daylight increasing,[67] so long the thrown weapons of both took hold and men dropped under them.  p 88  [68] But when the sun god stood bestriding the middle heaven,[69] then the father balanced his golden scales, and in them[70] he set two fateful portions of death, which lays men prostrate,[71] for Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,[72] and balanced it by the middle. The Achaians’ death-day was heaviest.[73] There the fates of the Achaians settled down toward the bountiful[74] earth, while those of the Trojans were lifted into the wide sky;[75] and he himself crashed a great stroke from Ida, and a kindling[76] flash shot over the people of the Achaians; seeing it[77] they were stunned, and pale terror took hold of all of them.[78] Then Idomeneus dared not to stand his ground, nor Agamemnon,[79] nor did the two Aiantes stand, the henchmen of Ares,[80] only Gerenian Nestor stayed, the Achaians’ watcher;[81] not that he would, but his horse was failing, struck by an arrow[82] from brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen;[83] struck at the point of the head, where the utmost hairs of horses[84] are grown along the skull, and which is a place most mortal.[85] He reared up in agony as the shaft went into the brain, then[86] threw the team into confusion writhing upon the bronze point.[87] Now as the old man hewed away the horse’s trace-harness[88] with a quick sword-cut, meanwhile the fast-running horses of Hektor[89] came through the flux of the fighting and carried their daring driver,[90] Hektor; and now the old man would have lost his life there, had not[91] Diomedes of the great war cry sharply perceived him.[92] He cried out in a terrible voice to rally Odysseus:[93] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[94] where are you running, turning your back in battle like a coward?[95] Do not let them strike the spear in your back as you run for it,[96] but stay, so that we can beat back this fierce man from the ancient.”[97] He spoke, but long-suffering great Odysseus gave no attention[98] as he swept by on his way to the hollow ships of the Achaians.[99] The son of Tydeus, alone as he was, went among the champions[100] and stood before the horses of the old man, the son of Neleus,[101] and uttering his winged words he addressed him: “Old sir,[102] in very truth these young fighters are too much for you,[103] and all your strength is gone, and hard old age is upon you,[104] your henchman is a man of no worth, and your horses are heavy.[105] Come then, climb into my chariot, so that you may see[106] what the Trojan horses are like, how they understand their[107] plain, and how to traverse it in rapid pursuit and withdrawal;[108] horses I took away from Aineias, who strikes men to terror.[109] Let the henchmen look after your horses now, while we two[110] steer these against the Trojans, breakers of horses, so Hektor[111] even may know if my spear also rages in my hands’ grip.”[112] He spoke, and Nestor the Gerenian horseman obeyed him.[113] Thereon the two strong henchmen, Sthenelos and the courtly[114] Eurymedon, looked after the horses of Nestor. The others[115] both together mounted the chariot of Diomedes.[116] Nestor in his hands took up the glittering reins, then[117] lashed the horses on, and soon they were close to Hektor,[118] and as he raged straight forward the son of Tydeus threw at him[119] and missed his man, but struck the charioteer, his henchman,  p 89  [120] Eniopeus, the son of high-hearted Thebaios, striking him[121] in the chest next to the nipple as he gripped the reins of his horses.[122] He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses[123] shied away. And there his life and his strength were scattered.[124] And bitter sorrow closed over Hektor’s heart for his driver,[125] yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there,[126] and went on after another bold charioteer; and it was not[127] long that the horses went lacking a driver, since soon he found one,[128] Archeptolemos, bold son of Iphitos, and gave into his hands[129] the reins, and mounted him behind the fast-running horses.[130] And now there would have been fighting beyond control, and destruction,[131] now they would have been driven and penned like sheep against Ilion,[132] had not the father of gods and of men sharply perceived them.[133] He thundered horribly and let loose the shimmering lightning[134] and dashed it to the ground in front of the horses of Diomedes[135] and a ghastly blaze of flaming sulphur shot up, and the horses[136] terrified both cringed away against the chariot.[137] And the glittering reins escaped out of the hands of Nestor,[138] and he was afraid in his heart and called out to Diomedes:[139] “Son of Tydeus, steer now to flight your single-foot horses.[140] Can you not see that the power of Zeus no longer is with you?[141] For the time Zeus, son of Kronos, gives glory to this man;[142] for today; hereafter, if he will, he will give it[143] to us also; no man can beat back the purpose of Zeus, not[144] even one very strong, since Zeus is by far the greater.”[145] Then in turn Diomedes of the great war cry answered:[146] “Yes, old sir, all this you have said is fair and orderly.[147] But this thought comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit;[148] for some day Hektor will say openly before the Trojans:[149] ‘The son of Tydeus, running before me, fled to his vessels.’[150] So he will vaunt; and then let the wide earth open beneath me.”[151] Nestor the Gerenian horseman spoke to him in answer:[152] “Ah me, son of the brave Tydeus; what a thing to have spoken.[153] If Hektor calls you a coward and a man of no strength, then[154] the Trojans and Dardanians will never believe him,[155] nor will the wives of the high-hearted Trojan warriors,[156] they whose husbands you hurled in the dust in the pride of their manhood.”[157] So he spoke, and turned to flight the single-foot horses[158] back again into the rout; and now the Trojans and Hektor[159] with unearthly clamour showered their baneful missiles upon them,[160] and tall Hektor of the shining helm called out in a great voice:[161] “Son of Tydeus, beyond others the fast-mounted Danaans honoured you[162] with pride of place, the choice meats and the filled wine-cups.[163] But now they will disgrace you, who are no better than a woman.[164] Down with you, you poor doll. You shall not storm our battlements[165] with me giving way before you, you shall not carry our women[166] home in your ships; before that comes I will give you your destiny.”[167] He spoke, and the son of Tydeus pondered doubtfully, whether[168] to turn his horses about and match his strength against Hektor.[169] Three times in his heart and spirit he pondered turning,[170] and three times from the hills of Ida Zeus of the counsels[171] thundered, giving a sign to the Trojans that the battle was turning.  p 90  [172] But Hektor called afar in a great voice to the Trojans:[173] “Trojans, Lykians and Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[174] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.[175] I see that the son of Kronos has bowed his head and assented[176] to my high glory and success, but granted the Danaans[177] disaster: fools, who designed with care these fortifications,[178] flimsy things, not worth a thought, which will not beat my strength[179] back, but lightly my horses will leap the ditch they have dug them.[180] But after I have come beside their hollow ships, let there[181] be some who will remember to bring me ravening fire,[182] so that I can set their ships on fire, and cut down[183] the very Argives mazed in the smoke at the side of their vessels.”[184] So he spoke, and called aloud to his horses, and spoke to them:[185] “Xanthos and you, Podargos, Aithon and Lampos the shining,[186] now repay me for all that loving care in abundance[187] Andromache the daughter of high-hearted Eëtion[188] gave you: the sweet-hearted wheat before all the others[189] and mixed wine with it for you to drink, when her heart inclined to it,[190] as for me, who am proud that I am her young husband.[191] Follow close now and be rapid, so we may capture[192] the shield of Nestor, whose high fame goes up to the sky now,[193] how it is all of gold, the shield itself and the cross-rods;[194] and strip from the shoulders of Diomedes, breaker of horses,[195] that elaborate corselet that Hephaistos wrought with much toil.[196] Could we capture these two things, I might hope the Achaians[197] might embark this very night on their fast-running vessels.”[198] So he spoke, boasting, and the lady Hera was angry,[199] and started upon her throne, and tall Olympos was shaken,[200] and she spoke straight out to the great god Poseidon:[201] “For shame, now, far-powerful shaker of the earth. In your breast[202] the heart takes no sorrow for the Danaans who are dying,[203] they who at Helike and at Aigai bring you offerings[204] numerous and delightful. Do you then plan that they conquer.[205] For if all of us who stand by the Danaans only were willing[206] to hurl back the Trojans and hold off Zeus of the broad brows,[207] he would be desperate, there where he sits by himself on Ida.”[208] Deeply troubled, the powerful shaker of the earth answered her[209] “Hera, reckless of word, what sort of thing have you spoken?[210] I would not be willing that all the rest of us fight with[211] Zeus, the son of Kronos, since he is so much the greater.”[212] Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile[213] for those others, all that space which the ditch of the wall held[214] off from the ships was filled with armoured men and with horses[215] penned there; and he who penned them was a man like the rapid war god,[216] Hektor, Priam’s son, since Zeus was giving him glory.[217] And now he might have kindled their balanced ships with the hot flame,[218] had not the lady Hera set it in Agamemnon’s[219] heart to rush in with speed himself and stir the Achaians.[220] He went on his way beside the Achaians’ ships and their shelters[221] holding up in his heavy hand the great coloured mantle,[222] and stood beside the black huge-hollowed ship of Odysseus,[223] which lay in the midmost, so that he could call out to both sides,  p 91  [224] either toward the shelters of Telamonian Aias,[225] or toward Achilleus, since these two had drawn their balanced ships up[226] at the utter ends, sure of the strength of their hands and their courage.[227] He lifted his voice and called in piercing cry to the Danaans:[228] “Shame, you Argives, poor nonentities splendid to look on.[229] Where are our high words gone, when we said that we were the bravest?[230] those words you spoke before all in hollow vaunting at Lemnos[231] when you were filled with abundant meat of the high-horned oxen[232] and drank from the great bowls filled to the brim with wine, how each man[233] could stand up against a hundred or even two hundred Trojans[234] in the fighting; now we together cannot match one of them,[235] Hektor, who must presently kindle our ships with the hot fire.[236] Father Zeus, is it one of our too strong kings you have stricken[237] in this disaster now, and stripped him of his high honour?[238] For I say that never did I pass by your fair-wrought altar[239] in my benched ships when I came here on this desperate journey;[240] but on all altars I burned the fat and the thighs of oxen[241] in my desire to sack the strong-walled city of the Trojans.[242] Still, Zeus, bring to pass at least this thing that I pray for.[243] Let our men at least get clear and escape, and let not[244] the Achaians be thus beaten down at the hands of the Trojans.”[245] He spoke thus, and as he wept the father took pity upon him[246] and bent his head, that the people should stay alive, and not perish.[247] Straightway he sent down the most lordly of birds, an eagle,[248] with a fawn, the young of the running deer, caught in his talons,[249] who cast down the fawn beside Zeus’ splendid altar[250] where the Achaians wrought their devotions to Zeus of the Voices.[251] They, when they saw the bird and knew it was Zeus who sent it,[252] remembered once again their warcraft, and turned on the Trojans.[253] Then, many as the Danaans were, there was no man among them[254] could claim he held his fast horses ahead of the son of Tydeus[255] to drive them once more across the ditch and fight at close quarters,[256] but he was far the first to kill a chief man of the Trojans,[257] Phradmon’s son, Agelaos, as he turned his team to escape him.[258] For in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed[259] between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.[260] He fell from the chariot, and his armour clattered upon him.[261] After him came the Atreidai, Menelaos and Agamemnon,[262] and the two Aiantes gathering their fierce strength about them,[263] and with them Idomeneus and Idomeneus’ companion[264] Meriones, a match for the murderous lord of battles,[265] and after these Eurypylos, the glorious son of Euaimon;[266] and ninth came Teukros, bending into position the curved bow,[267] and took his place in the shelter of Telamonian Aias’[268] shield, as Aias lifted the shield to take him. The hero[269] would watch, whenever in the throng he had struck some man with an arrow,[270] and as the man dropped and died where he was stricken, the archer[271] would run back again, like a child to the arms of his mother,[272] to Aias, who would hide him in the glittering shield’s protection.[273] Then which of the Trojans first did Teukros the blameless strike down?[274] Orsilochos first of all, and Ormenos, and Ophelestes,  p 92  [275] Daitor and Chromios, and Lykophontes the godlike,[276] and Amopaon, Polyaimon’s son, and Melanippos.[277] All these he felled to the bountiful earth in close succession.[278] Agamemnon the lord of men was glad as he watched him[279] laying waste from the strong bow the Trojan battalions;[280] he went over and stood beside him and spoke a word to him:[281] “Telamonian Teukros, dear heart, o lord of your people,[282] strike so; thus you may be a light given to the Danaans,[283] and to Telamon your father, who cherished you when you were little,[284] and, bastard as you were, looked after you in his own house.[285] Bring him into glory, though he is far away; and for my part,[286] I will tell you this, and it will be a thing accomplished:[287] if ever Zeus who holds the aegis and Athene grant me[288] to sack outright the strong-founded citadel of Ilion,[289] first after myself I will put into your hands some great gift[290] of honour; a tripod, or two horses and the chariot with them,[291] or else a woman, who will go up into the same bed with you.”[292] Then in answer to him again spoke Teukros the blameless:[293] “Son of Atreus, most lordly: must you then drive me, who am eager[294] myself, as it is? Never, so far as the strength is in me,[295] have I stopped, since we began driving the Trojans back upon Ilion;[296] since then I have been lurking here with my bow, to strike down[297] fighters. And by this I have shot eight long-flanged arrows,[298] and all of them were driven into the bodies of young men,[299] fighters; yet still I am not able to hit this mad dog.”[300] He spoke, and let fly another shaft from the bowstring,[301] straight for Hektor, and all his heart was straining to hit him;[302] but missed his man, and struck down instead a strong son of Priam,[303] Gorgythion the blameless, hit in the chest by an arrow;[304] Gorgythion whose mother was lovely Kastianeira,[305] Priam’s bride from Aisyme, with the form of a goddess.[306] He bent drooping his head to one side, as a garden poppy[307] bends beneath the weight of its yield and the rains of springtime;[308] so his head bent slack to one side beneath the helm’s weight.[309] But Teukros now let fly another shaft from the bowstring,[310] straight for Hektor, and all his heart was straining to hit him,[311] yet missed his man once again as Apollo faltered his arrow,[312] and struck Archeptolemos, bold charioteer of Hektor,[313] in the chest next to the nipple as he charged into the fighting.[314] He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses[315] shied away. And there his life and his strength were scattered.[316] And bitter sorrow closed over Hektor’s heart for his driver,[317] yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there,[318] and called to his brother Kebriones who stood near to take up[319] the reins of the horses, nor did he disobey him. But Hektor[320] himself vaulted down to the ground from the shining chariot[321] crying a terrible cry and in his hand caught up a great stone,[322] and went straight for Teukros, heart urgent to hit him. Now Teukros[323] had drawn a bitter arrow out of his quiver, and laid it[324] along the bowstring, but as he drew the shaft by his shoulder,[325] there where between neck and chest the collar-bone interposes,[326] and this is a spot most mortal; in this place shining-helmed Hektor  p 93  [327] struck him in all his fury with the jagged boulder, smashing[328] the sinew, and all his arm at the wrist was deadened.[329] He dropped to one knee and stayed, and the bow fell from his hand. Aias[330] was not forgetful of his fallen brother, but running[331] stood bestriding him and covered him under the great shield.[332] Thereon Mekisteus, son of Echios, and brilliant Alastor,[333] two staunch companions, stooping beneath it, caught up Teukros[334] and carried him, groaning heavily, to the hollow vessels.[335] Now once again the Olympian filled the Trojans with fury[336] and they piled the Achaians straight backward against the deep ditch,[337] as Hektor ranged in their foremost ranks in the pride of his great strength.[338] As when some hunting hound in the speed of his feet pursuing[339] a wild boar or a lion snaps from behind at his quarters[340] or flanks, but watches for the beast to turn upon him, so Hektor[341] followed close on the heels of the flowing-haired Achaians,[342] killing ever the last of the men; and they fled in terror.[343] But after they had crossed back over the ditch and the sharp stakes[344] in flight, and many had gone down under the hands of the Trojans,[345] they reined in and stood fast again beside their ships, calling[346] aloud upon each other, and to all of the gods uplifting[347] their hands each man of them cried out his prayers in a great voice,[348] while Hektor, wearing the stark eyes of a Gorgon, or murderous[349] Ares, wheeled about at the edge his bright-maned horses.[350] Now seeing them the goddess of the white arms, Hera, took pity[351] and immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:[352] “For shame, daughter of Zeus who wears the aegis! no longer[353] shall we care for the Danaans in their uttermost hour of destruction?[354] These must then fill out an evil destiny, and perish[355] in the wind of one man’s fury where none can stand now against him,[356] Hektor, Priam’s son, who has wrought so much evil already.”[357] Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered her:[358] “Yet even this man would have his life and strength taken from him,[359] dying under the hands of the Argives in his own country;[360] but it is my father who is so furious in his heart of evil.[361] He is hard, and forever wicked; he crosses my high hopes,[362] nor remembers at all those many times I rescued his own son,[363] Herakles, when the tasks of Eurystheus were too much for his strength.[364] And time and again he would cry out aloud to the heavens,[365] and Zeus would send me down in speed from the sky to help him.[366] If in the wiliness of my heart I had had thoughts like his,[367] when Herakles was sent down to Hades of the Gates, to hale back[368] from the Kingdom of the Dark the hound of the grisly death god,[369] never would he have got clear of the steep-dripping Stygian water.[370] Yet now Zeus hates me, and is bent to the wishes of Thetis[371] who kissed his knees and stroked his chin in her hand, and entreated[372] that he give honour to Achilleus, the sacker of cities.[373] Yet time shall be when he calls me again his dear girl of the grey eyes.[374] So then: do you put under their harness our single-foot horses[375] while I go back into the house of Zeus, the lord of the aegis,[376] and arm me in my weapons of war. So shall I discover[377] whether the son of Priam, Hektor of the shining helmet,[378] will feel joy to see us apparent on the outworks of battle,  p 94  [379] or see if some Trojan give the dogs and the birds their desire[380] with fat and flesh, struck down beside the ships of the Achaians.”[381] She spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess Hera of the white arms.[382] And she, Hera, exalted goddess, daughter of Kronos[383] the mighty, went away to harness the gold-bridled horses.[384] Now in turn Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,[385] beside the threshold of her father slipped off her elaborate[386] dress which she herself had wrought with her hands’ patience,[387] and now assuming the war tunic of Zeus who gathers[388] the clouds, she armed herself in her gear for the dismal fighting.[389] She set her feet in the blazing chariot, and took up a spear,[390] heavy, huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting[391] men, against whom she of the mighty father is angered.[392] Hera laid the lash swiftly on the horses; and moving[393] of themselves groaned the gates of the sky that the Hours guarded,[394] those Hours to whose charge is given the huge sky and Olympos[395] to open up the dense darkness or again to close it.[396] Through the way between they held the speed of their goaded horses.[397] But Zeus father, watching from Ida, was angered terribly[398] and stirred Iris of the golden wings to run with his message:[399] “Go forth, Iris the swift, turn them back again, let them not reach me,[400] since we would close in fighting thus that would be unseemly.[401] For I will say this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished:[402] I will lame beneath the harness their fast-running horses,[403] and hurl the gods from the driver’s place, and smash their chariot;[404] and not in the circle of ten returning years shall they be whole[405] of the wounds where the stroke of the lightning hits them; so that[406] the grey-eyed goddess may know when it is her father she fights with.[407] Yet with Hera I am not so angry, neither indignant,[408] since it is ever her way to cross the commands that I give her.”[409] He spoke, and Iris, storm-footed, rose with his message[410] and took her way from the peaks of Ida to tall Olympos,[411] and at the utmost gates of many-folded Olympos[412] met and stayed them, and spoke the word that Zeus had given her:[413] “Where so furious? How can your hearts so storm within you?[414] The son of Kronos will not let you stand by the Argives.[415] Since Zeus has uttered this threat and will make it a thing accomplished:[416] that he will lame beneath the harness your fast-running horses,[417] and hurl yourselves from the driver’s place, and smash your chariot;[418] and not in the circle of ten returning years would you be whole[419] of the wounds where the stroke of the lightning hits you; so that[420] you may know, grey-eyed goddess, when it is your father you fight with.[421] Yes, you, bold brazen wench, are audacious indeed, if truly[422] you dare to lift up your gigantic spear in the face of your father.[423] Yet with Hera he is not so angry, neither indignant,[424] since it is ever her way to cross the commands he gives her.”[425] So Iris the swift-footed spoke and went away from them,[426] and now Hera spoke a word to Pallas Athene:[427] “Alas, daughter of Zeus of the aegis: I can no longer[428] let us fight in the face of Zeus for the sake of mortals.[429] Let one of them perish then, let another live, as their fortune[430] wills; let him, as is his right and as his heart pleases,[431] work out whatever decrees he will on Danaans and Trojans.”  p 95  [432] So she spoke, and turned back again her single-foot horses,[433] and the Hours set free their flowing-maned horses from the harness,[434] and tethered them at their mangers that were piled with ambrosia[435] and leaned the chariot against the shining inward wall. Meanwhile[436] the goddesses themselves took their place on the golden couches[437] among the other immortals, their hearts deep grieving within them.[438] Now father Zeus steered back from Ida his strong-wheeled chariot[439] and horses to Olympos, and came among the gods’ sessions,[440] while for him the famed shaker of the earth set free his horses,[441] and put the chariot on its stand, with a cloth spread over it.[442] Then Zeus himself of the wide brows took his place on the golden[443] throne, as underneath his feet tall Olympos was shaken.[444] These two alone, Hera and Athene, stayed seated apart aside[445] from Zeus, and would not speak to him, nor ask him a question;[446] but he knew the whole matter within his heart, and spoke to them.[447] “Why then are you two sorrowful, Athene and Hera?[448] Surely in the battle where men win glory you were not wearied[449] out, destroying those Trojans on whom you have set your grim wrath.[450] In the whole account, such is my strength and my hand so invincible,[451] not all the gods who are on Olympos could turn me backward,[452] but before this the trembling took hold of your shining bodies,[453] before you could look upon the fighting and war’s work of sorrow;[454] for I will say straight out, and it would now be a thing accomplished:[455] once hit in your car by the lightning stroke you could never[456] have come back to Olympos, where is the place of the immortals.”[457] So he spoke; and Athene and Hera muttered, since they were[458] sitting close to each other, devising evil for the Trojans.[459] Still Athene stayed silent and said nothing, but only[460] sulked at Zeus her father, and savage anger took hold of her.[461] But the heart of Hera could not contain her anger, and she spoke forth:[462] “Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[463] We know well already your strength, how it is no small thing.[464] Yet even so we are sorrowful for the Danaan spearmen[465] who must fill out an unhappy destiny, and perish.[466] Still we shall keep out of the fighting, as you command us;[467] yet we will put good counsel in the Argives, if it may help them;[468] so that not all of them will die because of your anger.”[469] Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to her again in answer:[470] “Tomorrow at the dawning, lady Hera of the ox eyes,[471] you will see, if you have the heart, a still mightier son of Kronos[472] perishing the ranged numbers of Argive spearmen.[473] For Hektor the huge will not sooner be stayed from his fighting[474] until there stirs by the ships the swift-footed son of Peleus[475] on that day when they shall fight by the sterns of the beached ships[476] in the narrow place of necessity over fallen Patroklos.[477] This is the way it is fated to be; and for you and your anger[478] I care not; not if you stray apart to the undermost limits[479] of earth and sea, where Iapetos and Kronos seated[480] have no shining of the sun god Hyperion to delight them[481] nor winds’ delight, but Tartaros stands deeply about them;[482] not even if you reach that place in your wandering shall I[483] care for your sulks; since there is nothing more shameless than you are.”[484] So he spoke, and Hera of the white arms gave him no answer.  p 96  [485] And now the shining light of the sun was dipped in the Ocean[486] trailing black night across the grain-giving land. For the Trojans[487] the daylight sank against their will, but for the Achaians[488] sweet and thrice-supplicated was the coming on of the dark night.[489] Now glorious Hektor held an assembly of all the Trojans,[490] taking them aside from the ships, by a swirling river[491] on clean ground, where there showed a space not cumbered with corpses.[492] They stepped to the ground from behind their horses and listened to Hektor[493] the loved of Zeus, and the words he spoke to them. He in his hand held[494] the eleven-cubit-long spear, whose shaft was tipped with a shining[495] bronze spearhead, and a ring of gold was hooped to hold it.[496] Leaning upon this spear he spoke his words to the Trojans:[497] “Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me.[498] Now I had thought that, destroying the ships and all the Achaians,[499] we might take our way back once more to windy Ilion,[500] but the darkness came too soon, and this beyond all else rescued[501] the Argives and their vessels along the beach where the sea breaks.[502] But now let us give way to black night’s persuasion; let us[503] make ready our evening meal, and as for your flowing-maned horses,[504] set them free from their harness, and cast down fodder before them.[505] And lead forth also out of the city oxen and fat sheep[506] in all speed, and convey out also the kindly sweet wine[507] with food out of our houses. And heap many piles of firewood,[508] so that all night long and until the young dawn appears[509] we may burn many fires, and the glare go up into heaven;[510] so that not in the night-time the flowing-haired Achaians[511] may set out to run for home over the sea’s wide ridges.[512] No: not thus in their own good time must they take to their vessels,[513] but in such a way that a man of them at home will still nurse[514] his wound, the place where he has been hit with an arrow or sharp spear[515] springing to his ship; so that another may shrink hereafter[516] from bringing down fearful war on the Trojans, breakers of horses.[517] And let the heralds Zeus loves give orders about the city[518] for the boys who are in their first youth and the grey-browed elders[519] to take stations on the god-founded bastions that circle the city;[520] and as for the women, have our wives, each one in her own house,[521] kindle a great fire; let there be a watch kept steadily[522] lest a sudden attack get into the town when the fighters have left it.[523] Let it be thus, high-hearted men of Troy, as I tell you.[524] Let that word that has been spoken now be a strong one,[525] with that which I speak at dawn to the Trojans, breakers of horses.[526] For in good hope I pray to Zeus and the other immortals[527] that we may drive from our place these dogs swept into destruction[528] whom the spirits of death have carried here on their black ships.[529] Now for the night we shall keep watch on ourselves, and tomorrow[530] early, before dawn shows, shall arm ourselves in our weapons[531] and beside their hollow vessels waken the bitter war god;[532] and I shall know if the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,[533] will force me back from the ships against the wall, or whether I[534] shall cut him down with the bronze and take home the blooded war-spoils.[535] Tomorrow he will learn his own strength, if he can stand up to[536] my spear’s advance; but sooner than this, I think, in the foremost  p 97  [537] he will go down under the stroke, and many companions about him[538] as the sun goes up into tomorrow. Oh, if I only[539] could be as this in all my days immortal and ageless[540] and be held in honour as Athene and Apollo are honoured[541] as surely as this oncoming day brings evil to the Argives.”[542] So Hektor spoke among them, and the Trojans shouted approval.[543] And they set free their sweating horses from under the harness[544] and tethered them by the reins, each one by his own chariot.[545] They led forth also out of the city oxen and fat sheep[546] in all speed, and conveyed out also the kindly sweet wine,[547] with food out of their houses, and heaped many piles of firewood.[548] They accomplished likewise full sacrifices before the immortals,[549] and the winds wafted the savour aloft from the plain to the heavens[550] in its fragrance; and yet the blessed gods took no part of it.[551] They would not; so hateful to them was sacred Ilion,[552] and Priam, and the city of Priam of the strong ash spear.[553] So with hearts made high these sat night-long by the outworks[554] of battle, and their watchfires blazed numerous about them.[555] As when in the sky the stars about the moon’s shining[556] are seen in all their glory, when the air has fallen to stillness,[557] and all the high places of the hills are clear, and the shoulders out-jutting,[558] and the deep ravines, as endless bright air spills from the heavens[559] and all the stars are seen, to make glad the heart of the shepherd;[560] such in their numbers blazed the watchfires the Trojans were burning[561] between the waters of Xanthos and the ships, before Ilion.[562] A thousand fires were burning there in the plain, and beside each[563] one sat fifty men in the flare of the blazing firelight.[564] And standing each beside his chariot, champing white barley[565] and oats, the horses waited for the dawn to mount to her high place.book nine[1] So the Trojans held their night watches. Meanwhile immortal[2] Panic, companion of cold Terror, gripped the Achaians[3] as all their best were stricken with grief that passes endurance.[4] As two winds rise to shake the sea where the fish swarm, Boreas[5] and Zephyros, north wind and west, that blow from Thraceward,[6] suddenly descending, and the darkened water is gathered[7] to crests, and far across the salt water scatters the seaweed;[8] so the heart in the breast of each Achaian was troubled.[9] And the son of Atreus, stricken at heart with the great sorrow,[10] went among his heralds the clear-spoken and told them[11] to summon calling by name each man into the assembly[12] but with no outcry, and he himself was at work with the foremost.[13] They took their seats in assembly, dispirited, and Agamemnon[14] stood up before them, shedding tears, like a spring dark-running[15] that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water.[16] So, groaning heavily, Agamemnon spoke to the Argives:[17] “Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:[18] Zeus son of Kronos has caught me badly in bitter futility.[19] He is hard: who before this time promised me and consented  p 98  [20] that I might sack strong-walled Ilion and sail homeward.[21] Now he has devised a vile deception and bids me go back[22] to Argos in dishonour having lost many of my people.[23] Such is the way it will be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,[24] who before now has broken the crests of many cities[25] and will break them again, since his power is beyond all others.[26] Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us[27] run away with our ships to the beloved land of our fathers[28] since no longer now shall we capture Troy of the wide ways.”[29] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.[30] For some time the sons of the Achaians said nothing in sorrow;[31] but at long last Diomedes of the great war cry addressed them:[32] “Son of Atreus: I will be first to fight with your folly,[33] as is my right, lord, in this assembly; then do not be angered.[34] I was the first of the Danaans whose valour you slighted[35] and said I was unwarlike and without courage. The young men[36] of the Argives know all these things, and the elders know it.[37] The son of devious-devising Kronos has given you[38] gifts in two ways: with the sceptre he gave you honour beyond all,[39] but he did not give you a heart, and of all power this is the greatest.[40] Sir, sir, can you really believe the sons of the Achaians[41] are so unwarlike and so weak of their hearts as you call them?[42] But if in truth your own heart is so set upon going,[43] go. The way is there, and next to the water are standing[44] your ships that came—so many of them!—with you from Mykenai,[45] and yet the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians will stay here[46] until we have sacked the city of Troy; let even these also[47] run away with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,[48] still we two, Sthenelos and I, will fight till we witness[49] the end of Ilion; for it was with God that we made our way hither.”[50] So he spoke, and all the sons of the Achaians shouted[51] acclaim for the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses.[52] And now Nestor the horseman stood forth among them and spoke to them:[53] “Son of Tydeus, beyond others you are strong in battle,[54] and in counsel also are noblest among all men of your own age.[55] Not one man of all the Achaians will belittle your words nor[56] speak against them. Yet you have not made complete your argument,[57] since you are a young man still and could even be my own son[58] and my youngest born of all; yet still you argue in wisdom[59] with the Argive kings, since all you have spoken was spoken fairly.[60] But let me speak, since I can call myself older than you are,[61] and go through the whole matter, since there is none who can dishonour[62] the thing I say, not even powerful Agamemnon.[63] Out of all brotherhood, outlawed, homeless shall be that man[64] who longs for all the horror of fighting among his own people.[65] But now let us give way to the darkness of night, and let us[66] make ready our evening meal; and let the guards severally[67] take their stations by the ditch we have dug outside the ramparts.[68] This I would enjoin upon our young men; but thereafter[69] do you, son of Atreus, take command, since you are our kingliest.[70] Divide a feast among the princes; it befits you, it is not[71] unbecoming. Our shelters are filled with wine that the Achaian  p 99  [72] ships carry day by day from Thrace across the wide water.[73] All hospitality is for you; you are lord over many.[74] When many assemble together follow him who advises[75] the best counsel, for in truth there is need for all the Achaians[76] of good close counsel, since now close to our ships the enemy[77] burn their numerous fires. What man could be cheered to see this?[78] Here is the night that will break our army, or else will preserve it.”[79] So he spoke, and they listened hard to him, and obeyed him,[80] and the sentries went forth rapidly in their armour, gathering[81] about Nestor’s son Thrasymedes, shepherd of the people,[82] and about Askalaphos and Ialmenos, sons both of Ares,[83] about Meriones and Aphareus and Deïpyros[84] and about the son of Kreion, Lykomedes the brilliant.[85] There were seven leaders of the sentinels, and with each one a hundred[86] fighting men followed gripping in their hands the long spears.[87] They took position in the space between the ditch and the rampart,[88] and there they kindled their fires and each made ready his supper.[89] But the son of Atreus led the assembled lords of the Achaians[90] to his own shelter, and set before them the feast in abundance.[91] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[92] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[93] the aged man began to weave his counsel before them[94] first, Nestor, whose advice had shown best before this.[95] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[96] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[97] with you I will end, with you I will make my beginning, since you[98] are lord over many people, and Zeus has given into your hand[99] the sceptre and rights of judgment, to be king over the people.[100] It is yours therefore to speak a word, yours also to listen,[101] and grant the right to another also, when his spirit stirs him[102] to speak for our good. All shall be yours when you lead the way. Still[103] I will speak in the way it seems best to my mind, and no one[104] shall have in his mind any thought that is better than this one[105] that I have in my mind either now or long before now[106] ever since that day, illustrious, when you went from the shelter[107] of angered Achilleus, taking by force the girl Briseis[108] against the will of the rest of us, since I for my part[109] urged you strongly not to, but you, giving way to your proud heart’s[110] anger, dishonoured a great man, one whom the immortals[111] honour, since you have taken his prize and keep it. But let us[112] even now think how we can make this good and persuade him[113] with words of supplication and with the gifts of friendship.”[114] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:[115] “Aged sir, this was no lie when you spoke of my madness.[116] I was mad, I myself will not deny it. Worth many[117] fighters is that man whom Zeus in his heart loves, as now[118] he has honoured this man and beaten down the Achaian people.[119] But since I was mad, in the persuasion of my heart’s evil,[120] I am willing to make all good, and give back gifts in abundance.[121] Before you all I will count off my gifts in their splendour:[122] seven unfired tripods; ten talents’ weight of gold; twenty[123] shining cauldrons; and twelve horses, strong, race-competitors  p 100  [124] who have won prizes in the speed of their feet. That man would not be[125] poor in possessions, to whom were given all these have won me,[126] nor be unpossessed of dearly honoured gold, were he given[127] all the prizes these single-foot horses have won for me.[128] I will give him seven women of Lesbos, the work of whose hands is[129] blameless, whom when he himself captured strong-founded Lesbos[130] I chose, and who in their beauty surpassed the races of women.[131] I will give him these, and with them shall go the one I took from him,[132] the daughter of Briseus. And to all this I will swear a great oath[133] that I never entered into her bed and never lay with her[134] as is natural for human people, between men and women.[135] All these gifts shall be his at once; but again, if hereafter[136] the gods grant that we storm and sack the great city of Priam,[137] let him go to his ship and load it deep as he pleases[138] with gold and bronze, when we Achaians divide the war spoils,[139] and let him choose for himself twenty of the Trojan women[140] who are the loveliest of all after Helen of Argos.[141] And if we come back to Achaian Argos, pride of the tilled land,[142] he may be my son-in-law; I will honour him with Orestes[143] my growing son, who is brought up there in abundant luxury.[144] Since, as I have three daughters there in my strong-built castle,[145] Chrysothemis and Laodike and Iphianassa,[146] let him lead away the one of these that he likes, with no bride-price,[147] to the house of Peleus, and with the girl I will grant him as dowry[148] many gifts, such as no man ever gave with his daughter.[149] I will grant to him seven citadels, strongly settled:[150] Kardamyle, and Enope, and Hire of the grasses,[151] Pherai the sacrosanct, and Antheia deep in the meadows,[152] with Aipeia the lovely and Pedasos of the vineyards.[153] All these lie near the sea, at the bottom of sandy Pylos,[154] and men live among them rich in cattle and rich in sheepflocks,[155] who will honour him as if he were a god with gifts given[156] and fulfil his prospering decrees underneath his sceptre.[157] All this I will bring to pass for him, if he changes from his anger.[158] Let him give way. For Hades gives not way, and is pitiless,[159] and therefore he among all the gods is most hateful to mortals.[160] And let him yield place to me, inasmuch as I am the kinglier[161] and inasmuch as I can call myself born the elder.”[162] Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:[163] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[164] none could scorn any longer these gifts you offer to Achilleus[165] the king. Come, let us choose and send some men, who in all speed[166] will go to the shelter of Achilleus, the son of Peleus;[167] or come, the men on whom my eye falls, let these take the duty.[168] First of all let Phoinix, beloved of Zeus, be their leader,[169] and after him take Aias the great, and brilliant Odysseus,[170] and of the heralds let Odios and Eurybates go with them.[171] Bring also water for their hands, and bid them keep words of good omen,[172] so we may pray to Zeus, son of Kronos, if he will have pity.”[173] So he spoke, and the word he spoke was pleasing to all of them.[174] And the heralds brought water at once, and poured it over[175] their hands, and the young men filled the mixing-bowl with pure wine  p 101  [176] and passed it to all, pouring first a libation in goblets.[177] Then when they had poured out wine, and drunk as much as their hearts wished,[178] they set out from the shelter of Atreus’ son, Agamemnon.[179] And the Gerenian horseman Nestor gave them much instruction,[180] looking eagerly at each, and most of all at Odysseus,[181] to try hard, so that they might win over the blameless Peleion.[182] So these two walked along the strand of the sea deep-thundering[183] with many prayers to the holder and shaker of the earth, that they[184] might readily persuade the great heart of Aiakides.[185] Now they came beside the shelters and ships of the Myrmidons[186] and they found Achilleus delighting his heart in a lyre, clear-sounding,[187] splendid and carefully wrought, with a bridge of silver upon it,[188] which he won out of the spoils when he ruined Eëtion’s city.[189] With this he was pleasuring his heart, and singing of men’s fame,[190] as Patroklos was sitting over against him, alone, in silence,[191] watching Aiakides and the time he would leave off singing.[192] Now these two came forward, as brilliant Odysseus led them,[193] and stood in his presence. Achilleus rose to his feet in amazement[194] holding the lyre as it was, leaving the place where he was sitting.[195] In the same way Patroklos, when he saw the men come, stood up.[196] And in greeting Achilleus the swift of foot spoke to them:[197] “Welcome. You are my friends who have come, and greatly I need you,[198] who even to this my anger are dearest of all the Achaians.”[199] So brilliant Achilleus spoke, and guided them forward,[200] and caused them to sit down on couches with purple coverlets[201] and at once called over to Patroklos who was not far from him:[202] “Son of Menoitios, set up a mixing-bowl that is bigger,[203] and mix us stronger drink, and make ready a cup for each man,[204] since these who have come beneath my roof are the men that I love best.”[205] So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion,[206] and tossed down a great chopping-block into the firelight,[207] and laid upon it the back of a sheep, and one of a fat goat,[208] with the chine of a fatted pig edged thick with lard, and for him[209] Automedon held the meats, and brilliant Achilleus carved them,[210] and cut it well into pieces and spitted them, as meanwhile[211] Menoitios’ son, a man like a god, made the fire blaze greatly.[212] But when the fire had burned itself out, and the flames had died down,[213] he scattered the embers apart, and extended the spits across them[214] lifting them to the andirons, and sprinkled the meats with divine salt.[215] Then when he had roasted all, and spread the food on the platters,[216] Patroklos took the bread and set it out on a table[217] in fair baskets, while Achilleus served the meats. Thereafter[218] he himself sat over against the godlike Odysseus[219] against the further wall, and told his companion, Patroklos,[220] to sacrifice to the gods; and he threw the firstlings in the fire.[221] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[222] But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,[223] Aias nodded to Phoinix, and brilliant Odysseus saw it,[224] and filled a cup with wine, and lifted it to Achilleus:[225] “Your health, Achilleus. You have no lack of your equal portion[226] either within the shelter of Atreus’ son, Agamemnon,  p 102  [227] nor here now in your own. We have good things in abundance[228] to feast on; here it is not the desirable feast we think of,[229] but a trouble all too great, beloved of Zeus, that we look on[230] and are afraid. There is doubt if we save our strong-benched vessels[231] or if they will be destroyed, unless you put on your war strength.[232] The Trojans in their pride, with their far-renowned companions,[233] have set up an encampment close by the ships and the rampart,[234] and lit many fires along their army, and think no longer[235] of being held, but rather to drive in upon the black ships.[236] And Zeus, son of Kronos, lightens upon their right hand, showing them[237] portents of good, while Hektor in the huge pride of his strength rages[238] irresistibly, reliant on Zeus, and gives way to no one[239] neither god nor man, but the strong fury has descended upon him.[240] He prays now that the divine Dawn will show most quickly,[241] since he threatens to shear the uttermost horns from the ship-sterns,[242] to light the ships themselves with ravening fire, and to cut down[243] the Achaians themselves as they stir from the smoke beside them.[244] All this I fear terribly in my heart, lest immortals[245] accomplish all these threats, and lest for us it be destiny[246] to die here in Troy, far away from horse-pasturing Argos.[247] Up, then! if you are minded, late though it be, to rescue[248] the afflicted sons of the Achaians from the Trojan onslaught.[249] It will be an affliction to you hereafter, there will be no remedy[250] found to heal the evil thing when it has been done. No, beforehand[251] take thought to beat the evil day aside from the Danaans.[252] Dear friend, surely thus your father Peleus advised you[253] that day when he sent you away to Agamemnon from Phthia:[254] ‘My child, for the matter of strength, Athene and Hera will give it[255] if it be their will, but be it yours to hold fast in your bosom[256] the anger of the proud heart, for consideration is better.[257] Keep from the bad complication of quarrel, and all the more for this[258] the Argives will honour you, both their younger men and their elders.’[259] So the old man advised, but you have forgotten. Yet even now[260] stop, and give way from the anger that hurts the heart. Agamemnon[261] offers you worthy recompense if you change from your anger.[262] Come then, if you will, listen to me, while I count off for you[263] all the gifts in his shelter that Agamemnon has promised:[264] Seven unfired tripods; ten talents’ weight of gold; twenty[265] shining cauldrons; and twelve horses, strong, race-competitors[266] who have won prizes in the speed of their feet. That man would not be[267] poor in possessions, to whom were given all these have won him,[268] nor be unpossessed of dearly honoured gold, were he given[269] all the prizes Agamemnon’s horses won in their speed for him.[270] He will give you seven women of Lesbos, the work of whose hands[271] is blameless, whom when you yourself captured strong-founded Lesbos[272] he chose, and who in their beauty surpassed the races of women.[273] He will give you these, and with them shall go the one he took from you,[274] the daughter of Briseus. And to all this he will swear a great oath[275] that he never entered into her bed and never lay with her[276] as is natural for human people, between men and women.[277] All these gifts shall be yours at once; but again, if hereafter[278] the gods grant that we storm and sack the great city of Priam,  p 103  [279] you may go to your ship and load it deep as you please with[280] gold and bronze, when we Achaians divide the war spoils,[281] and you may choose for yourself twenty of the Trojan women,[282] who are the loveliest of all after Helen of Argos.[283] And if we come back to Achaian Argos, pride of the tilled land,[284] you could be his son-in-law; he would honour you with Orestes,[285] his growing son, who is brought up there in abundant luxury.[286] Since, as he has three daughters there in his strong-built castle,[287] Chrysothemis and Laodike and Iphianassa,[288] you may lead away the one of these that you like, with no bride-price,[289] to the house of Peleus; and with the girl he will grant you as dowry[290] many gifts, such as no man ever gave with his daughter.[291] He will grant you seven citadels, strongly settled:[292] Kardamyle and Enope and Hire of the grasses,[293] Pherai the sacrosanct, and Antheia deep in the meadows,[294] with Aipeia the lovely, and Pedasos of the vineyards.[295] All these lie near the sea, at the bottom of sandy Pylos,[296] and men live among them rich in cattle and rich in sheepflocks,[297] who will honour you as if you were a god with gifts given[298] and fulfil your prospering decrees underneath your sceptre.[299] All this he will bring to pass for you, if you change from your anger.[300] But if the son of Atreus is too much hated in your heart,[301] himself and his gifts, at least take pity on all the other[302] Achaians, who are afflicted along the host, and will honour you[303] as a god. You may win very great glory among them.[304] For now you might kill Hektor, since he would come very close to you[305] with the wicked fury upon him, since he thinks there is not his equal[306] among the rest of the Danaans the ships carried hither.”[307] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[308] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:[309] without consideration for you I must make my answer,[310] the way I think, and the way it will be accomplished, that you may not[311] come one after another, and sit by me, and speak softly.[312] For as I detest the doorways of Death, I detest that man, who[313] hides one thing in the depths of his heart, and speaks forth another.[314] But I will speak to you the way it seems best to me: neither[315] do I think the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, will persuade me,[316] nor the rest of the Danaans, since there was no gratitude given[317] for fighting incessantly forever against your enemies.[318] Fate is the same for the man who holds back, the same if he fights hard.[319] We are all held in a single honour, the brave with the weaklings.[320] A man dies still if he has done nothing, as one who has done much.[321] Nothing is won for me, now that my heart has gone through its afflictions[322] in forever setting my life on the hazard of battle.[323] For as to her unwinged young ones the mother bird brings back[324] morsels, wherever she can find them, but as for herself it is suffering,[325] such was I, as I lay through all the many nights unsleeping,[326] such as I wore through the bloody days of the fighting,[327] striving with warriors for the sake of these men’s women.[328] But I say that I have stormed from my ships twelve cities[329] of men, and by land eleven more through the generous Troad.[330] From all these we took forth treasures, goodly and numerous,  p 104  [331] and we would bring them back, and give them to Agamemnon,[332] Atreus’ son; while he, waiting back beside the swift ships,[333] would take them, and distribute them little by little, and keep many.[334] All the other prizes of honour he gave the great men and the princes[335] are held fast by them, but from me alone of all the Achaians[336] he has taken and keeps the bride of my heart. Let him lie beside her[337] and be happy. Yet why must the Argives fight with the Trojans?[338] And why was it the son of Atreus assembled and led here[339] these people? Was it not for the sake of lovely-haired Helen?[340] Are the sons of Atreus alone among mortal men the ones[341] who love their wives? Since any who is a good man, and careful,[342] loves her who is his own and cares for her, even as I now[343] loved this one from my heart, though it was my spear that won her.[344] Now that he has deceived me and taken from my hands my prize of honour,[345] let him try me no more. I know him well. He will not persuade me.[346] Let him take counsel with you, Odysseus, and the rest of the princes[347] how to fight the ravening fire away from his vessels.[348] Indeed, there has been much hard work done even without me;[349] he has built himself a wall and driven a ditch about it,[350] making it great and wide, and fixed the sharp stakes inside it.[351] Yet even so he cannot hold the strength of manslaughtering[352] Hektor; and yet when I was fighting among the Achaians[353] Hektor would not drive his attack beyond the wall’s shelter[354] but would come forth only so far as the Skaian gates and the oak tree.[355] There once he endured me alone, and barely escaped my onslaught.[356] But, now I am unwilling to fight against brilliant Hektor,[357] tomorrow, when I have sacrificed to Zeus and to all gods,[358] and loaded well my ships, and rowed out on to the salt water,[359] you will see, if you have a mind to it and if it concerns you,[360] my ships in the dawn at sea on the Hellespont where the fish swarm[361] and my men manning them with good will to row. If the glorious[362] shaker of the earth should grant us a favouring passage[363] on the third day thereafter we might raise generous Phthia.[364] I have many possessions there that I left behind when I came here[365] on this desperate venture, and from here there is more gold, and red bronze,[366] and fair-girdled women, and grey iron I will take back;[367] all that was allotted to me. But my prize: he who gave it,[368] powerful Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has taken it back again[369] outrageously. Go back and proclaim to him all that I tell you,[370] openly, so other Achaians may turn against him in anger[371] if he hopes yet one more time to swindle some other Danaan,[372] wrapped as he is forever in shamelessness; yet he would not,[373] bold as a dog though he be, dare look in my face any longer.[374] I will join with him in no counsel, and in no action.[375] He cheated me and did me hurt. Let him not beguile me[376] with words again. This is enough for him. Let him of his own will[377] be damned, since Zeus of the counsels has taken his wits away from him.[378] I hate his gifts. I hold him light as the strip of a splinter.[379] Not if he gave me ten times as much, and twenty times over[380] as he possesses now, not if more should come to him from elsewhere,[381] or gave all that is brought in to Orchomenos, all that is brought in[382] to Thebes of Egypt, where the greatest possessions lie up in the houses,  p 105  [383] Thebes of the hundred gates, where through each of the gates two hundred[384] fighting men come forth to war with horses and chariots;[385] not if he gave me gifts as many as the sand or the dust is,[386] not even so would Agamemnon have his way with my spirit[387] until he had made good to me all this heartrending insolence.[388] Nor will I marry a daughter of Atreus’ son, Agamemnon,[389] not if she challenged Aphrodite the golden for loveliness,[390] not if she matched the work of her hands with grey-eyed Athene;[391] not even so will I marry her; let him pick some other Achaian,[392] one who is to his liking and is kinglier than I am.[393] For if the gods will keep me alive, and I win homeward,[394] Peleus himself will presently arrange a wife for me.[395] There are many Achaian girls in the land of Hellas and Phthia,[396] daughters of great men who hold strong places in guard. And of these[397] any one that I please I might make my beloved lady.[398] And the great desire in my heart drives me rather in that place[399] to take a wedded wife in marriage, the bride of my fancy,[400] to enjoy with her the possessions won by aged Peleus. For not[401] worth the value of my life are all the possessions they fable[402] were won for Ilion, that strong-founded citadel, in the old days[403] when there was peace, before the coming of the sons of the Achaians;[404] not all that the stone doorsill of the Archer holds fast within it,[405] of Phoibos Apollo in Pytho of the rocks. Of possessions[406] cattle and fat sheep are things to be had for the lifting,[407] and tripods can be won, and the tawny high heads of horses,[408] but a man’s life cannot come back again, it cannot be lifted[409] nor captured again by force, once it has crossed the teeth’s barrier.[410] For my mother Thetis the goddess of the silver feet tells me[411] I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. Either,[412] if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,[413] my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;[414] but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,[415] the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life[416] left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.[417] And this would be my counsel to others also, to sail back[418] home again, since no longer shall you find any term set[419] on the sheer city of Ilion, since Zeus of the wide brows has strongly[420] held his own hand over it, and its people are made bold.[421] Do you go back therefore to the great men of the Achaians,[422] and take them this message, since such is the privilege of the princes:[423] that they think out in their minds some other scheme that is better,[424] which might rescue their ships, and the people of the Achaians[425] who man the hollow ships, since this plan will not work for them[426] which they thought of by reason of my anger. Let Phoinix[427] remain here with us and sleep here, so that tomorrow[428] he may come with us in our ships to the beloved land of our fathers,[429] if he will; but I will never use force to hold him.”[430] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence[431] in amazement at his words. He had spoken to them very strongly.[432] But at long last Phoinix the aged horseman spoke out[433] in a stormburst of tears, and fearing for the ships of the Achaians:[434] “If it is going home, glorious Achilleus, you ponder  p 106  [435] in your heart, and are utterly unwilling to drive the obliterating[436] fire from the fast ships, since anger has descended on your spirit,[437] how then shall I, dear child, be left in this place behind you[438] all alone? Peleus the aged horseman sent me forth with you[439] on that day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon[440] a mere child, who knew nothing yet of the joining of battle[441] nor of debate where men are made pre-eminent. Therefore[442] he sent me along with you to teach you of all these matters,[443] to make you a speaker of words and one who accomplished in action.[444] Therefore apart from you, dear child, I would not be willing[445] to be left behind, not were the god in person to promise[446] he would scale away my old age and make me a young man blossoming[447] as I was that time when I first left Hellas, the land of fair women,[448] running from the hatred of Ormenos’ son Amyntor,[449] my father; who hated me for the sake of a fair-haired mistress.[450] For he made love to her himself, and dishonoured his own wife,[451] my mother; who was forever taking my knees and entreating me[452] to lie with this mistress instead so that she would hate the old man.[453] I was persuaded and did it; and my father when he heard of it straightway[454] called down his curses, and invoked against me the dreaded furies[455] that I might never have any son born of my seed to dandle[456] on my knees; and the divinities, Zeus of the underworld[457] and Persephone the honoured goddess, accomplished his curses.[458] Then I took it into my mind to cut him down with the sharp bronze,[459] but some one of the immortals checked my anger, reminding me[460] of rumour among the people and men’s maledictions repeated,[461] that I might not be called a parricide among the Achaians.[462] But now no more could the heart in my breast be ruled entirely[463] to range still among these halls when my father was angered.[464] Rather it was the many kinsmen and cousins about me[465] who held me closed in the house, with supplications repeated,[466] and slaughtered fat sheep in their numbers, and shambling horn-curved[467] cattle, and numerous swine with the fat abundant upon them[468] were singed and stretched out across the flame of Hephaistos,[469] and much wine was drunk that was stored in the jars of the old man.[470] Nine nights they slept nightlong in their places beside me,[471] and they kept up an interchange of watches, and the fire was never[472] put out; one below the gate of the strong-closed courtyard,[473] and one in the ante-chamber before the doors of the bedroom.[474] But when the tenth night had come to me in its darkness,[475] then I broke the close-compacted doors of the chamber[476] and got away, and overleapt the fence of the courtyard[477] lightly, unnoticed by the guarding men and the women servants.[478] Then I fled far away through the wide spaces of Hellas[479] and came as far as generous Phthia, mother of sheepflocks,[480] and to lord Peleus, who accepted me with a good will[481] and gave me his love, even as a father loves his own son[482] who is a single child brought up among many possessions.[483] He made me a rich man, and granted me many people,[484] and I lived, lord over the Dolopes, in remotest Phthia,[485] and, godlike Achilleus, I made you all that you are now,[486] and loved you out of my heart, for you would not go with another  p 107  [487] out to any feast, nor taste any food in your own halls[488] until I had set you on my knees, and cut little pieces[489] from the meat, and given you all you wished, and held the wine for you.[490] And many times you soaked the shirt that was on my body[491] with wine you would spit up in the troublesomeness of your childhood.[492] So I have suffered much through you, and have had much trouble,[493] thinking always how the gods would not bring to birth any children[494] of my own; so that it was you, godlike Achilleus, I made[495] my own child, so that some day you might keep hard affliction from me.[496] Then, Achilleus, beat down your great anger. It is not[497] yours to have a pitiless heart. The very immortals[498] can be moved; their virtue and honour and strength are greater than ours are,[499] and yet with sacrifices and offerings for endearment,[500] with libations and with savour men turn back even the immortals[501] in supplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses.[502] For there are also the spirits of Prayer, the daughters of great Zeus,[503] and they are lame of their feet, and wrinkled, and cast their eyes sidelong,[504] who toil on their way left far behind by the spirit of Ruin:[505] but she, Ruin, is strong and sound on her feet, and therefore[506] far outruns all Prayers, and wins into every country[507] to force men astray; and the Prayers follow as healers after her.[508] If a man venerates these daughters of Zeus as they draw near,[509] such a man they bring great advantage, and hear his entreaty;[510] but if a man shall deny them, and stubbornly with a harsh word[511] refuse, they go to Zeus, son of Kronos, in supplication[512] that Ruin may overtake this man, that he be hurt, and punished.[513] So, Achilleus: grant, you also, that Zeus’ daughters be given[514] their honour, which, lordly though they be, curbs the will of others.[515] Since, were he not bringing gifts and naming still more hereafter,[516] Atreus’ son; were he to remain still swollen with rancour,[517] even I would not bid you throw your anger aside, nor[518] defend the Argives, though they needed you sorely. But see now,[519] he offers you much straightway, and has promised you more hereafter;[520] he has sent the best men to you to supplicate you, choosing them[521] out of the Achaian host, those who to yourself are the dearest[522] of all the Argives. Do not you make vain their argument[523] nor their footsteps, though before this one could not blame your anger.[524] Thus it was in the old days also, the deeds that we hear of[525] from the great men, when the swelling anger descended upon them.[526] The heroes would take gifts; they would listen, and be persuaded.[527] For I remember this action of old, it is not a new thing,[528] and how it went; you are all my friends, I will tell it among you.[529] The Kouretes and the steadfast Aitolians were fighting[530] and slaughtering one another about the city of Kalydon,[531] the Aitolians in lovely Kalydon’s defence, the Kouretes[532] furious to storm and sack it in war. For Artemis,[533] she of the golden chair, had driven this evil upon them,[534] angered that Oineus had not given the pride of the orchards[535] to her, first fruits; the rest of the gods were given due sacrifice,[536] but alone to this daughter of great Zeus he had given nothing.[537] He had forgotten, or had not thought, in his hard delusion,[538] and in wrath at his whole mighty line the Lady of Arrows  p 108  [539] sent upon them the fierce wild boar with the shining teeth, who[540] after the way of his kind did much evil to the orchards of Oineus.[541] For he ripped up whole tall trees from the ground and scattered them headlong[542] roots and all, even to the very flowers of the orchard.[543] The son of Oineus killed this boar, Meleagros, assembling[544] together many hunting men out of numerous cities[545] with their hounds; since the boar might not have been killed by a few men,[546] so huge was he, and had put many men on the sad fire for burning.[547] But the goddess again made a great stir of anger and crying[548] battle, over the head of the boar and the bristling boar’s hide,[549] between Kouretes and the high-hearted Aitolians. So long[550] as Meleagros lover of battle stayed in the fighting[551] it went the worse for the Kouretes, and they could not even[552] hold their ground outside the wall, though they were so many.[553] But when the anger came upon Meleagros, such anger[554] as wells in the hearts of others also, though their minds are careful,[555] he, in the wrath of his heart against his own mother, Althaia,[556] lay apart with his wedded bride, Kleopatra the lovely,[557] daughter of sweet-stepping Marpessa, child of Euenos,[558] and Idas, who was the strongest of all men upon earth[559] in his time; for he even took up the bow to face the King’s onset,[560] Phoibos Apollo, for the sake of the sweet-stepping maiden;[561] a girl her father and honoured mother had named in their palace[562] Alkyone, sea-bird, as by-name, since for her sake[563] her mother with the sorrow-laden cry of a sea-bird[564] wept because far-reaching Phoibos Apollo had taken her;[565] with this Kleopatra he lay mulling his heart-sore anger,[566] raging by reason of his mother’s curses, which she called down[567] from the gods upon him, in deep grief for the death of her brother,[568] and many times beating with her hands on the earth abundant[569] she called on Hades and on honoured Persephone, lying[570] at length along the ground, and the tears were wet on her bosom,[571] to give death to her son; and Erinys, the mist-walking,[572] she of the heart without pity, heard her out of the dark places.[573] Presently there was thunder about the gates, and the sound rose[574] of towers under assault, and the Aitolian elders[575] supplicated him, sending their noblest priests of the immortals,[576] to come forth and defend them; they offered him a great gift:[577] wherever might lie the richest ground in lovely Kalydon,[578] there they told him to choose out a piece of land, an entirely[579] good one, of fifty acres, the half of it to be vineyard[580] and the half of it unworked ploughland of the plain to be furrowed.[581] And the aged horseman Oineus again and again entreated him,[582] and took his place at the threshold of the high-vaulted chamber[583] and shook against the bolted doors, pleading with his own son.[584] And again and again his honoured mother and his sisters[585] entreated him, but he only refused the more; then his own friends[586] who were the most honoured and dearest of all entreated him;[587] but even so they could not persuade the heart within him[588] until, as the chamber was under close assault, the Kouretes[589] were mounting along the towers and set fire to the great city.[590] And then at last his wife, the fair-girdled bride, supplicated  p 109  [591] Meleagros, in tears, and rehearsed in their numbers before him[592] all the sorrows that come to men when their city is taken:[593] they kill the men, and the fire leaves the city in ashes,[594] and strangers lead the children away and the deep-girdled women.[595] And the heart, as he listened to all this evil, was stirred within him,[596] and he rose, and went, and closed his body in shining armour.[597] So he gave way in his own heart, and drove back the day of evil[598] from the Aitolians; yet these no longer would make good[599] their many and gracious gifts; yet he drove back the evil from them.[600] Listen, then; do not have such a thought in your mind; let not[601] the spirit within you turn you that way, dear friend. It would be worse[602] to defend the ships after they are burning. No, with gifts promised[603] go forth. The Achaians will honour you as they would an immortal.[604] But if without gifts you go into the fighting where men perish,[605] your honour will no longer be as great, though you drive back the battle.”[606] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[607] “Phoinix my father, aged, illustrious, such honour is a thing[608] I need not. I think I am honoured already in Zeus’ ordinance[609] which will hold me here beside my curved ships as long as life’s wind[610] stays in my breast, as long as my knees have their spring beneath me.[611] And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.[612] Stop confusing my heart with lamentation and sorrow[613] for the favour of great Atreides. It does not become you[614] to love this man, for fear you turn hateful to me, who love you.[615] It should be your pride with me to hurt whoever shall hurt me.[616] Be king equally with me; take half of my honour.[617] These men will carry back the message; you stay here and sleep here[618] in a soft bed, and we shall decide tomorrow, as dawn shows,[619] whether to go back home again or else to remain here.”[620] He spoke, and, saying nothing, nodded with his brows to Patroklos[621] to make up a neat bed for Phoinix, so the others might presently[622] think of going home from his shelter. The son of Telamon,[623] Aias the godlike, saw it, and now spoke his word among them:[624] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:[625] let us go. I think that nothing will be accomplished[626] by argument on this errand; it is best to go back quickly[627] and tell this story, though it is not good, to the Danaans[628] who sit there waiting for us to come back, seeing that Achilleus[629] has made savage the proud-hearted spirit within his body.[630] He is hard, and does not remember that friends’ affection[631] wherein we honoured him by the ships, far beyond all others.[632] Pitiless. And yet a man takes from his brother’s slayer[633] the blood price, or the price for a child who was killed, and the guilty[634] one, when he has largely repaid, stays still in the country,[635] and the injured man’s heart is curbed, and his pride, and his anger[636] when he has taken the price; but the gods put in your breast a spirit[637] not to be placated, bad, for the sake of one single[638] girl. Yet now we offer you seven, surpassingly lovely,[639] and much beside these. Now make gracious the spirit within you.[640] Respect your own house; see, we are under the same roof with you,[641] from the multitude of the Danaans, we who desire beyond all[642] others to have your honour and love, out of all the Achaians.”[643] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:  p 110  [644] “Son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, Aias, lord of the people:[645] all that you have said seems spoken after my own mind.[646] Yet still the heart in me swells up in anger, when I remember[647] the disgrace that he wrought upon me before the Argives,[648] the son of Atreus, as if I were some dishonoured vagabond.[649] Do you then go back to him, and take him this message:[650] that I shall not think again of the bloody fighting[651] until such time as the son of wise Priam, Hektor the brilliant,[652] comes all the way to the ships of the Myrmidons, and their shelters,[653] slaughtering the Argives, and shall darken with fire our vessels.[654] But around my own shelter, I think, and beside my black ship[655] Hektor will be held, though he be very hungry for battle.”[656] He spoke, and they taking each a two-handled cup poured out[657] a libation, then went back to their ships, and Odysseus led them.[658] Now Patroklos gave the maids and his followers orders[659] to make up without delay a neat bed for Phoinix.[660] And these obeyed him and made up the bed as he had commanded,[661] laying fleeces on it, and a blanket, and a sheet of fine linen.[662] There the old man lay down and waited for the divine Dawn.[663] But Achilleus slept in the inward corner of the strong-built shelter,[664] and a woman lay beside him, one he had taken from Lesbos,[665] Phorbas’ daughter, Diomede of the fair colouring.[666] In the other corner Patroklos went to bed; with him also[667] was a girl, Iphis the fair-girdled, whom brilliant Achilleus[668] gave him, when he took sheer Skyros, Enyeus’ citadel.[669] Now when these had come back to the shelters of Agamemnon,[670] the sons of the Achaians greeted them with their gold cups[671] uplifted, one after another, standing, and asked them questions.[672] And the first to question them was the lord of men, Agamemnon:[673] “Tell me, honoured Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians:[674] is he willing to fight the ravening fire away from our vessels,[675] or did he refuse, and does the anger still hold his proud heart?”[676] Then long-suffering great Odysseus spoke to him in answer:[677] “Son of Atreus, most lordly, king of men, Agamemnon.[678] That man will not quench his anger, but still more than ever[679] is filled with rage. He refuses you and refuses your presents.[680] He tells you yourself to take counsel among the Argives[681] how to save your ships, and the people of the Achaians.[682] And he himself has threatened that tomorrow as dawn shows[683] he will drag down his strong-benched, oarswept ships to the water.[684] He said it would be his counsel to others also, to sail back[685] home again, since no longer will you find any term set[686] on the sheer city of Ilion, since Zeus of the wide brows has strongly[687] held his own hand over it, and its people are made bold.[688] So he spoke. There are these to attest it who went there with me[689] also, Aias, and the two heralds, both men of good counsel.[690] But aged Phoinix stayed there for the night, as Achilleus urged him,[691] so he might go home in the ships to the beloved land of his fathers[692] if Phoinix will; but he will never use force to persuade him.”[693] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence[694] in amazement at his words. He had spoken to them very strongly.[695] For a long time the sons of the Achaians said nothing, in sorrow,  p 111  [696] but at long last Diomedes of the great war cry spoke to them:[697] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[698] I wish you had not supplicated the blameless son of Peleus[699] with innumerable gifts offered. He is a proud man without this,[700] and now you have driven him far deeper into his pride. Rather[701] we shall pay him no more attention, whether he comes in with us[702] or stays away. He will fight again, whenever the time comes[703] that the heart in his body urges him to, and the god drives him.[704] Come then, do as I say, and let us all be won over.[705] Go to sleep, now that the inward heart is made happy[706] with food and drink, for these are the strength and courage within us.[707] But when the lovely dawn shows forth with rose fingers, Atreides,[708] rapidly form before our ships both people and horses[709] stirring them on, and yourself be ready to fight in the foremost.”[710] So he spoke, and all the kings gave him their approval,[711] acclaiming the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses.[712] Then they poured a libation, and each man went to his shelter,[713] where they went to their beds and took the blessing of slumber.book ten[1] Now beside their ships the other great men of the Achaians[2] slept night long, with the soft bondage of slumber upon them;[3] but the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[4] was held by no sweet sleep as he pondered deeply within him.[5] As when the lord of Hera the lovely-haired flashes his lightning[6] as he brings on a great rainstorm, or a hail incessant,[7] or a blizzard, at such time when the snowfall scatters on ploughlands,[8] or drives on somewhere on earth the huge edge of tearing battle,[9] such was Agamemnon, with the beating turmoil in his bosom[10] from the deep heart, and all his wits were shaken within him.[11] Now he would gaze across the plain to the Trojan camp, wondering[12] at the number of their fires that were burning in front of Ilion,[13] toward the high calls of their flutes and pipes, the murmur of people.[14] Now as he would look again to the ships and the Achaian[15] people, he would drag the hair by its roots from his head, looking[16] toward Zeus on high, and his proud heart was stricken with lamentation.[17] Now to his mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,[18] first among men to seek out Nestor, the son of Neleus,[19] to see if Nestor with him could work out a plan that would not fail,[20] and one that might drive the evil away from all the Danaans.[21] He stood upright, and slipped the tunic upon his body,[22] and underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,[23] and thereafter slung across him the tawny hide of a lion[24] glowing and huge, that swung to his feet, and took up a spear.[25] So likewise trembling seized Menelaos, neither on his eyes[26] had sweet slumber descending settled, for fear that the Argives[27] might suffer some hurt, they who for his sake over much water[28] had come to Troy, bearing their bold attack to the Trojans.[29] First of all he mantled his broad back in a leopard’s[30] spotted hide, then lifting the circle of a brazen helmet  p 112  [31] placed it upon his head, and took up a spear in his big hand,[32] and went on his way to waken his brother, who was the great king[33] of all Argives, one honoured in his own land as a god is.[34] He found him putting the splendid armour about his shoulders[35] beside the stern of his ship, and was welcomed as he came up to him.[36] It was Menelaos of the great war cry who spoke first:[37] “Why this arming, my brother? Is it some one of your companions[38] you are stirring to go and spy on the Trojans? Yet I fear sadly[39] there will not be any man to undertake this endeavour,[40] going against enemy fighters to spy on them, alone, through[41] the immortal night. Such a man will have to be very bold-hearted.”[42] Then in turn powerful Agamemnon answered him:[43] “You and I, illustrious, o Menelaos, have need now[44] of crafty counsel, if any man is to defend and rescue[45] the Argives and their ships, since the heart of Zeus is turned from us.[46] For the sacrifices of Hektor have stirred his heart more than ours have.[47] No, for I never saw nor heard from the lips of another[48] of a single man in a day imagining so much evil[49] as Hektor, beloved of Zeus, has wrought on the sons of the Achaians,[50] alone, being called true son neither of a god nor a goddess.[51] He has done things I think the Argives will remember with sorrow[52] long into the future, such harm has he devised the Achaians.[53] But go now, running lightly beside the ships, and call to us[54] Idomeneus and Aias, while I shall go after Nestor[55] the brilliant, and waken him to rise, if he might be willing[56] to approach the sacred duty of the guards, or give orders to them.[57] Above all, these would listen to him, seeing that his own son[58] commands the pickets, and with him the follower of Idomeneus,[59] Meriones. To these above all we entrusted the duty.”[60] Then in turn Menelaos of the great war cry answered him:[61] “How then do you intend this order that you have given me?[62] Shall I wait where I am, with them, and watch for your coming,[63] or run after you, when I have properly given the order?”[64] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:[65] “Better wait here, so there will be no way we can miss one another[66] as we come and go. There are many paths up and down the encampment.[67] Call out wherever you go, and waken each man to give him[68] your orders, naming him by descent with the name of his father.[69] Give each man due respect. Let not your spirit be haughty,[70] but let it be you and I ourselves who do the work, seeing[71] that Zeus cast on us as we were born this burden of evil.”[72] So he spoke and with careful orders sent off his brother,[73] and he himself went in search of Nestor, shepherd of the people,[74] and came on him beside his own shelter and his own black ship[75] in a soft bed, and his bright gear was lying beside him,[76] the shield, and the two spears, and the glittering helmet, and by him[77] lay in all its shining the war belt, in which the old man[78] girt himself, when he armed for the fighting where men die, leading[79] his own people, since he gave no ground to sorrowful old age.[80] He straightened up and raised his head, leaning on one elbow,[81] and spoke to the son of Atreus, and asked him a question:[82] “Who are you, who walk alone through the ships and the army  p 113  [83] and through the darkness of night when other mortals are sleeping?[84] Are you looking for one of your mules, or looking for some companion?[85] Speak, do not come upon me in silence. What would you of me?”[86] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:[87] “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,[88] you will know Atreus’ son Agamemnon, whom beyond others[89] Zeus has involved in hard work forever, as long as life’s wind[90] stays in my breast, as long as my knees have their spring beneath me.[91] I am driven thus, because the ease of sleep will not settle[92] on my eyes, but fighting and the cares of the Achaians perplex me.[93] Terribly I am in dread for the Danaans, nor does my pulse beat[94] steadily, but I go distracted, and my heart is pounding[95] through my chest, and my shining limbs are shaken beneath me.[96] But if you are for action, since sleep comes neither upon you,[97] let us both go out to the pickets, so that we may see[98] if they might not have found weariness too much for them, and fallen[99] asleep, and altogether forgotten their duty, to keep watch.[100] There are men who hate us sitting nearby, nor do we know[101] that they might not be pondering an attack on us in the darkness.”[102] Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:[103] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[104] Zeus of the counsels, I think, will not accomplish for Hektor[105] all his designs and all he hopes for now; I think rather[106] he will have still more hardships to wrestle, if ever Achilleus[107] turns again the heart within him from its wearisome anger.[108] Surely, I will go with you, and let us also awaken[109] others, the son of Tydeus the spear-famed, and Odysseus,[110] and Aias the swift-footed, and the powerful son of Phyleus.[111] But if one were to go also and call these others I speak of,[112] Aias the great, the godlike one, and the lord Idomeneus,[113] why, their ships lie farthest from us, and are not at all close.[114] But, beloved as he is and respected, I will still blame[115] Menelaos, even though you be angry, and I will not hide it,[116] for the way he sleeps and has given to you alone all the hard work.[117] For now he ought to be hard at work going to all the great men[118] in supplication. This need that has come is no more endurable.”[119] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:[120] “Aged sir, other times I also would tell you to blame him,[121] since often he hangs back and is not willing to work hard,[122] not that he shrinks from it and gives way, nor in the mind’s dullness,[123] but because he looks to me, and waits till I make a beginning.[124] But this time he woke far before me, and came to rouse me,[125] and I sent him on to call those you ask after. Therefore[126] let us go. We shall find those others there with the sentries[127] before the gates, where I told them to form and assemble.”[128] Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:[129] “Thus no man of the Argives can disobey him nor find fault[130] with him, whenever he stirs up any of them and gives orders.”[131] With this speech, he slipped the tunic upon his body[132] and underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,[133] and pinned about him a great vermilion mantle sweeping[134] in a double fold, with a thick fleece of wool upon it.  p 114  [135] Then he caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,[136] and went on his way down the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.[137] First he came on Odysseus, the equal of Zeus in counsel,[138] and Nestor the Gerenian horseman wakened him from sleep,[139] speaking aloud, and the wave of the voice swept quick through his hearing[140] and he came forth from his shelter and called out his word to them:[141] “Why do you wander thus up and down the ships and the army[142] alone, through the immortal night? What need is upon you?”[143] Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:[144] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[145] do not be angry; such grief has fallen upon the Achaians.[146] Come then with us to waken another, for whom it is becoming[147] to deliberate the question of running away or of fighting.”[148] He spoke, and resourceful Odysseus moving back into his shelter[149] put the bright-patterned shield on his shoulders, and went on with them.[150] They went to the son of Tydeus, Diomedes, and found him[151] with his gear outside the shelter, and his companions about him[152] slept with their shields underneath their heads, and their spears beside them[153] stood upright, the heels driven deep in the ground, and the bronze afar off[154] glared, like the lightning of Zeus father. The hero[155] slept, with the hide of a field-ranging ox laid beneath him,[156] but underneath his head was laid a lustrous blanket.[157] Nestor the Gerenian horseman stood by to waken him[158] and roused him, stirring him with his heel, and scolded him to his face:[159] “Son of Tydeus, wake up! Why do you doze in slumber[160] nightlong? Do you not hear how the Trojans at the break of the flat land[161] are sitting close to our ships, and narrow grounds holds them from us?”[162] So he spoke, and the other rapidly stirred from his sleeping[163] and spoke winged words to him and addressed him thus: “Aged sir,[164] you are a hard man. You are never finished with working.[165] Now are there not other sons of the Achaians younger than you are[166] who could be going about everywhere to each of the princes[167] and waking them up? But you, aged sir, are too much for us.”[168] In turn Nestor the Gerenian horseman said to him:[169] “Yes, dear friend, all this that you said has been fairly spoken.[170] I myself have sons without blame, I have followers,[171] plenty of them, of whom any could go to summon the princes.[172] But this difficulty is very great that has come to the Achaians,[173] since for all of us the decision now stands on the edge of a razor[174] whether the Achaians shall have life or sorry destruction.[175] But go now Aias the swift and the son of Phyleus[176] and waken them—you are younger than I—if truly you have pity.”[177] He spoke, and the other wrapped his shoulders in the hide of a lion[178] glowing and huge, that swung to his feet, and took up a spear.[179] The hero went, and waking the others brought them back with him.[180] Now as these men mingled with the sentries assembling[181] they found the leaders of the pickets by no means asleep[182] but all of them were wide awake, and sat by their weapons.[183] As dogs about the sheep in a yard are restless in watching[184] as they hear a wild beast boldly moving, who through the timber[185] goes among the mountains, and a clamour rises about him[186] of men and of dogs, and all their sleep has been broken from them;  p 115  [187] so for these the softness of sleep was broken from their eyes[188] as they held the bitter midwatch, since they were turning always[189] toward the plain, where they heard the Trojans coming and going.[190] The aged man was glad when he saw them, and with speech of good cheer[191] spoke winged words to them and addressed them thus: “Continue[192] to keep your watch this way, beloved children, and let not[193] sleep seize any, lest you become a delight to your enemies.”[194] So he spoke, and strode on through the ditch, and there followed with him[195] the kings of the Argives, all who had been called into conclave,[196] and with them went Meriones and Nestor’s glorious[197] son, since the kings themselves called these to take counsel with them.[198] After they had crossed the deep-dug ditch they settled[199] on clean ground, where there showed a space not cumbered with corpses[200] of the fallen, a place whence Hektor the huge had turned back[201] from destroying the Argives, after the night had darkened about him.[202] There they seated themselves, and opened words to each other,[203] and the Gerenian horseman Nestor began speaking among them:[204] “O my friends, is there no man who, trusting in the daring[205] of his own heart, would go among the high-hearted Trojans?[206] So he might catch some enemy, who straggled behind them,[207] or he might overhear some thing that the Trojans are saying,[208] what they deliberate among themselves, and whether they purpose[209] to stay where they are, close to the ships, or else to withdraw back[210] into their city, now that they have beaten the Achaians.[211] Could a man learn this, and then come back again to us[212] unhurt, why huge and heaven-high would rise up his glory[213] among all people, and an excellent gift would befall him;[214] for all those who hold by the ships high power as princes,[215] of all these each one of them will give him a black sheep,[216] female, with a lamb beneath; there shall be no gift like this one,[217] one that will be forever by at the feasts and festivals.”[218] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence;[219] but now Diomedes of the great war cry spoke forth among them:[220] “Nestor, my own heart and my own proud spirit arouse me[221] to go into the host of the hateful men who lie near us,[222] the Trojans; but if some other man would go along with me[223] there would be more comfort in it, and greater confidence.[224] When two go together, one of them at least looks forward[225] to see what is best; a man by himself, though he be careful,[226] still has less mind in him than two, and his wits have less weight.”[227] He spoke, and many were willing to go with Diomedes.[228] The two Aiantes were willing, henchman of Ares, and likewise[229] Meriones, and Nestor’s son altogether willing,[230] and Atreus’ son was willing, Menelaos the spear-famed,[231] and patient Odysseus too was willing to enter the multitude[232] of Trojans, since forever the heart in his breast was daring.[233] Now it was the lord of men, Agamemnon, who spoke to them:[234] “Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,[235] pick your man to be your companion, whichever you wish,[236] the best of all who have shown, since many are eager to do it.[237] You must not, for the awe that you feel in your heart, pass over  p 116  [238] the better man and take the worse, giving way to modesty[239] and looking to his degree—not even if he be kinglier.”[240] So he spoke, and was frightened for Menelaos of the fair hair.[241] But now again Diomedes of the great war cry spoke forth:[242] “If indeed you tell me myself to pick my companion,[243] how then could I forget Odysseus the godlike, he whose[244] heart and whose proud spirit are beyond all others forward[245] in all hard endeavours, and Pallas Athene loves him.[246] Were he to go with me, both of us could come back from the blazing[247] of fire itself, since his mind is best at devices.”[248] Then in turn long-suffering brilliant Odysseus answered him:[249] “Son of Tydeus, do not praise me so, nor yet blame me.[250] These are the Argives, who know well all these matters you speak of.[251] But let us go: for the night draws far along, and the dawn nears,[252] the stars have gone far on their course, and the full of the night has passed by,[253] through two portions, and the third portion is that which is left us.”[254] So they spoke, and armed themselves in their weapons of terror,[255] and Thrasymedes the stubborn in battle gave the son of Tydeus[256] a two-edged sword (his own had been left behind by his vessel)[257] and a shield; and he put over his head a helmet[258] of bull’s hide, with neither horn nor crest, which is known as[259] the skull cap, and guards the heads of strong men in battle;[260] while Meriones gave Odysseus a bow and a quiver[261] and a sword; and he too put over his head a helmet[262] fashioned of leather; on the inside the cap was cross-strung firmly[263] with thongs of leather, and on the outer side the white teeth[264] of a tusk-shining boar were close sewn one after another[265] with craftsmanship and skill; and a felt was set in the centre.[266] Autolykos, breaking into the close-built house, had stolen it[267] from Amyntor, the son of Ormenos, out of Eleon,[268] and gave it to Kytherian Amphidamas, at Skandeia;[269] Amphidamas gave it in turn to Molos, a gift of guest-friendship,[270] and Molos gave it to his son Meriones to carry.[271] But at this time it was worn to cover the head of Odysseus.[272] When these two had armed themselves in their weapons of terror[273] they went on their way, and left behind there all the princes,[274] and on the right near the way they were taking Pallas Athene[275] sent down a heron to them; indeed, their eyes could not see it[276] through the darkness of night, but they could hear it crying.[277] And Odysseus was glad at the bird-sign, and prayed to Athene:[278] “Hear me, daughter of Zeus of the aegis, you who forever[279] stand beside me in all hard tasks, nor am I forgotten[280] as I go my ways: now give me the best of your love, Athene,[281] and grant that we come back in glory to the strong-benched vessels[282] when we have done a great thing that will sadden the Trojans.”[283] Diomedes of the great war cry spoke in prayer after him:[284] “Hear me also, Atrytone, daughter of great Zeus.[285] Come with me now as you went with my father, brilliant Tydeus,[286] into Thebes, when he went with a message before the Achaians,[287] and left the bronze-armoured Achaians beside Asopos[288] while he carried a word of friendship to the Kadmeians[289] in that place; but on his way back he was minded to grim deeds  p 117  [290] with your aid, divine goddess, since you stood in goodwill beside him.[291] So now again be willing to stand by me, and watch over me,[292] and I in turn will dedicate you a heifer, broad-browed,[293] one year old, unbroken, that no man ever led under[294] the yoke. I will drench her horns in gold and offer her to you.”[295] So they spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard them.[296] Then, after they had made their prayers to the daughter of great Zeus[297] they went on their way like two lions into the black night[298] through the carnage and through the corpses, war gear and dark blood.[299] Nor did Hektor either permit the high-hearted Trojans[300] to sleep, but had called together in a group all of their great men,[301] those who were the leaders of Troy and their men of deliberation.[302] Summoning these he compacted before them his close counsel:[303] “Who would take upon him this work and bring it to fulfilment[304] for a huge price? The reward will be one that will suffice him;[305] for I will give a chariot and two strong-necked horses[306] who are the finest of all beside the fast ships of the Achaians[307] to him who has the daring, winning honour for himself also,[308] to go close to the swift-running ships and find out for us[309] whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,[310] or whether now the Achaians who are beaten under our hands[311] are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing[312] to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.”[313] So he spoke, and all of them were stricken to silence.[314] But there was one among the Trojans, Dolon, Eumedes’[315] son, the sacred herald’s, a man of much gold and much bronze.[316] He was an evil man to look on, but was swift-footed;[317] moreover he was a single son among five sisters.[318] This man now spoke his word before the Trojans and Hektor:[319] “Hektor, my own heart and my proud spirit arouse me[320] to go close to the swift-running ships and to learn about them.[321] Come then, hold up your sceptre before me, and swear upon it[322] that you will give me the horses, and the chariot made bright[323] with bronze, that carry the blameless son of Peleus. I shall not[324] be a vain spy for you, nor less than your expectation,[325] for I shall go straight on through their army, until I come to[326] the ship of Agamemnon, where their greatest men must be gathered[327] to deliberate the question of running away or of fighting.”[328] He spoke, and Hektor took the staff in his hand, and swore to him:[329] “Let Zeus, loud-thundering lord of Hera, now be my witness[330] himself, that no other man of the Trojans shall mount these horses,[331] since I say they shall be utterly yours, and your glory.”[332] He spoke, and swore to an empty oath, and stirred the man onward.[333] And at once Dolon cast across his shoulders the bent bow.[334] He put on about him the pelt of a grey wolf, and on his head set[335] a cap of marten’s hide, and took up a sharp throwing spear[336] and went on his way toward the ships from his own camp, nor was he ever[337] to come back again from the ships, and carry his word to Hektor.[338] Now when he had left behind the throng of men and of horses[339] he went on his way, eagerly, but illustrious Odysseus[340] was aware of him coming and spoke to Diomedes:[341] “This is some man, Diomedes, on his way from the army.  p 118  [342] I do not know whether he comes to spy on our vessels[343] or to strip some one of the perished corpses, but we must let him[344] first go on past us a little way in the open[345] and afterwards we will make a rush and fasten upon him[346] suddenly. But if in the speed of his feet he eludes us[347] then keep him crowded upon the ships, and away from the army[348] always, feinting with the spear, nor let him escape to the city.”[349] So they spoke, and bent aside from their way, through the corpses,[350] while he in the thoughtlessness of his heart ran swiftly by them.[351] But when he was gone from them as far as the range of a plough yoke[352] of mules, since these are better beasts than oxen for dragging[353] the wrought ploughshare through the depth of the harvest land, these two[354] ran after him, and he heard the thudding of their feet and stopped still.[355] He thought in his heart these would be friends from among the Trojans[356] to turn him back, and that Hektor had sped them to summon him again.[357] But when they got to a spear’s throw from him, or less even,[358] he saw that these were enemy men, and moved his knees rapidly[359] to run away, and these set out in rapid chase of him.[360] And, as when two rip-fanged hounds have sighted a wild beast,[361] a young deer, or a hare, and go after it, eagerly always[362] through the spaces of the woods, and the chase runs crying before them,[363] so the son of Tydeus, and Odysseus, sacker of cities,[364] kept always hard on his heels and cut him off from his people.[365] But when he was on the point of reaching the Achaian pickets,[366] as he fled toward the vessels, then Athene put great power[367] in Tydeus’ son, so that no other bronze-armoured Achaian[368] might win the glory of striking him down, and he come in second.[369] Powerful Diomedes threatening with the spear spoke to him:[370] “Either wait, or my spear will catch you. I think that you will not[371] thus get clear from my hands for long, and sudden destruction.”[372] He spoke, and let fly with his spear, but missed, on purpose,[373] his man, as the point of the polished spear went over his right shoulder[374] and stuck fast in the earth. And Dolon stood still in terror[375] gibbering, as through his mouth came the sound of his teeth’s chatter[376] in green fear; and these two, breathing hard, came up to him[377] and caught him by the hands, and he broke into tears and spoke to them:[378] “Take me alive, and I will pay my ransom: in my house[379] there is bronze, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,[380] and my father would make you glad with abundant ransom[381] were he to hear that I am alive by the ships of the Achaians.”[382] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn, and answered him:[383] “Do not fear, and let no thought of death be upon you.[384] But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately:[385] where is it that you walk alone to the ships from the army[386] through the darkness of night when other mortals are sleeping?[387] Is it to strip some one of the perished corpses, or is it[388] that Hektor sent you out to spy with care upon each thing[389] beside our hollow ships? Or did your own spirit drive you?”[390] Then Dolon answered him, but his legs were shaking beneath him:[391] “Hektor has led my mind astray with many deceptions.[392] He promised me the single-foot horses of proud Achilleus,[393] Peleus’ son, and the chariot bright with bronze, for my gift,  p 119  [394] and gave me an order, to go through the running black night,[395] and get close to the enemy men, and find out for him[396] whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,[397] or whether now the Achaians who are broken under our hands[398] are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing[399] to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.”[400] Then Odysseus the resourceful smiled and spoke to him:[401] “Surely now, these were mighty gifts that your heart longed after,[402] the horses of valiant Aiakides. They are difficult horses[403] for mortal men to manage, or even to ride behind them[404] for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother.[405] But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately.[406] Where did you leave Hektor, the people’s shepherd, when you came here?[407] Where is his gear of war lying? Where are his horses?[408] How are the rest of the Trojans disposed, the guards and the sleepers?[409] What do they deliberate among themselves? Do they purpose[410] to stay where they are, close to the ships? Or else to withdraw back[411] into the city, now that they have beaten the Achaians?”[412] Then in turn Dolon the son of Eumedes spoke to him:[413] “See, I will accurately recite all these things to you.[414] Hektor is now among those who are the men of counsel[415] and they hold their deliberations by the barrow of godlike Ilos[416] apart from the confusion. But those guards that you ask of, hero—[417] there is no detail that protects the army and guards it.[418] As for the watchfire hearths of the Trojans, those who must do it[419] keep awake by the fires and pass on the picket duty[420] to each other, but their far-assembled companions in battle[421] are sleeping, and pass on to the Trojans the duty of watching,[422] since their own children do not lie nearby, nor their women.”[423] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn, and answered him:[424] “How, then, are these sleeping? And are they mixed with the Trojans,[425] breakers of horses, or apart? Tell me, so I may be clear.”[426] Then in turn Dolon the son of Eumedes answered him:[427] “See, I will accurately recite all these things to you.[428] Next the sea are the Karians, and Paionians with their curved bows,[429] the Leleges and Kaukonians and the brilliant Pelasgians.[430] By Thymbre are stationed the Lykians and the proud Mysians[431] with the Phrygians who fight from horses, and Maionians, lords of chariots.[432] But why do you question me on all this, each thing in detail?[433] For if you are minded to get among the mass of the Trojans,[434] here are the Thracians, new come, separate, beyond all others[435] in place, and among them Rhesos their king, the son of Eïoneus.[436] And his are the finest horses I ever saw, and the biggest;[437] they are whiter than snow, and their speed of foot is the winds’ speed;[438] his chariot is fairly ornate with gold and with silver,[439] and the armour is golden and gigantic, a wonder to look on,[440] that he brought here with him. It is not like armour for mortal[441] men to carry, but for the immortal gods. And therefore[442] take me with you to some place by the fast-running vessels,[443] or else tie me fast here in a pitiless bond, and leave me,[444] until you can make your venture, and try out the truth of my story,[445] whether I have told you this fairly, or whether I have not.”  p 120  [446] But powerful Diomedes looked darkly at him and spoke then:[447] “Do not, Dolon, have in your mind any thought of escape[448] now you have got in our hands, though you brought us an excellent message.[449] For if we let you get away now, or set you free, later[450] you will come back again to the fast ships of the Achaians[451] either to spy on us once more, or to fight strongly with us.[452] But if, beaten down under my hands, you lose your life now,[453] then you will nevermore be an affliction upon the Argives.”[454] He spoke, and the man was trying to reach his chin with his strong hand[455] and cling, and supplicate him, but he struck the middle of his neck[456] with a sweep of the sword, and slashed clean through both tendons,[457] and Dolon’s head still speaking dropped in the dust. They took off[458] his cap of marten’s hide from his head, and stripped off also[459] the wolf’s pelt, and the back-strung bow, and the long spear.[460] Brilliant Odysseus held these up to Athene the Spoiler[461] high in his hand, and spoke a word, and prayed to Athene:[462] “Hail, goddess. These are yours. To you first of all the immortals[463] on Olympos we will give your due share. Only guide us[464] once again to where the Thracians sleep, and their horses.”[465] So he spoke, and lifting the spoils high from him he placed them[466] upon a tamarisk bush, and piled a clear landmark beside them,[467] pulling reeds together and the long branches of tamarisk[468] that they might not miss them on their way back through the running black night.[469] These two went ahead on their way through war gear and dark blood[470] and came suddenly to the Thracians for whom they were looking.[471] These were asleep, worn out with weariness, and their armour[472] lay in splendour and good order on the ground beside them[473] in three rows, and beside each man stood his team of horses.[474] Rhesos slept in the centre with his fast horses about him[475] tethered by the reins to the outer rail of the chariot. Odysseus[476] was the first to see him and pointed him out to Diomedes:[477] “Here is our man, see, Diomedes, and here are his horses,[478] those that Dolon, the man we killed, pointed out to us.[479] Come then, put forward your great strength. Here is no matter[480] for standing by idle in your weapons. Untie the horses;[481] or else let me look after them, while you kill the people.”[482] He spoke, and grey-eyed Athene breathed strength into Diomedes[483] and he began to kill them one after another. Grim sounds rose[484] from there as they were stricken with the sword, and the ground reddened with blood.[485] As a lion advancing on the helpless herds unshepherded[486] of sheep or goats pounces upon them with wicked intention,[487] so the son of Tydeus attacked the Thracian people[488] until he had killed twelve. Meanwhile resourceful Odysseus[489] as Tydeus’ son stood over each man with the sword, and struck him,[490] would catch each dead man by the foot from behind, and drag him[491] away, with this thought in his mind, that the bright-maned horses[492] might pass easily through and not be shaken within them[493] at stepping on dead men. These horses were not yet used to them.[494] But when the son of Tydeus came to the king, and this was  p 121  [495] the thirteenth man, he stripped the sweetness of life from him[496] as he lay heavily breathing—since a bad dream stood by his head[497] in the night—no dream, but Oineus’ son, by device of Athene.[498] Meanwhile patient Odysseus was untying the single-foot horses,[499] and pulled them together with the reins, and drove them from the confusion[500] and whipped them with his bow, since he had not noticed nor taken[501] in his hands the glittering whip that was in the elaborate chariot.[502] He whistled to brilliant Diomedes as a signal to him.[503] But he waited, divided in his mind as to what he would best do,[504] whether to seize the chariot, wherein lay the bright armour,[505] and draw it away by the pole, or lift it and carry it off with him,[506] or strip the life from still more of the Thracians. Meanwhile[507] as he was pondering all this in his heart, Athene[508] came and stood beside him, and spoke to great Diomedes:[509] “Think now, son of great-hearted Tydeus, of getting back[510] to the hollow ships; else you might go back with men pursuing[511] if there should be some other god to waken the Trojans.”[512] So she spoke, and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking[513] and lightly mounted behind the horses. Odysseus whipped them[514] with his bow, and they ran for the rapid ships of the Achaians.[515] Neither did Apollo of the silver bow keep blind watch,[516] since he saw Athene attending the son of Tydeus. Angered[517] with her he plunged into the great multitude of the Trojans[518] and roused a man of counsel among the Thracians, Hippokoön[519] the lordly cousin of Rhesos; and he, starting out of his sleep,[520] when he saw the place left empty where the fast horses had been standing[521] and his men in the shambles of slaughter gasping their lives out,[522] he groaned, and called aloud by name his beloved companion.[523] And a clamour rose up from the Trojans and a vast turmoil[524] as they swept together in confusion and stared at the ghastly work done[525] by these two men, before they went back to their hollow vessels.[526] But when these had come back to the place where they killed Hektor’s scout,[527] Odysseus beloved of Zeus reined in his running horses[528] while Tydeus’ son leaping to the ground took the bloody war spoils[529] and handed them to Odysseus, and got up behind the horses.[530] Odysseus lashed them on, and they winged their way unreluctant[531] back to the hollow ships, since this was the way he desired it.[532] Nestor was the first to hear their thunder, and spoke forth:[533] “Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel,[534] shall I be wrong, or am I speaking the truth? My heart tells me.[535] The thunder is beating against my ears of fast-running horses.[536] Might this only be Odysseus and strong Diomedes[537] driving rapidly away from the Trojans their single-foot horses![538] Yet terribly I fear in my heart that these bravest Achaians[539] might have suffered some disaster from the loud host of the Trojans.”[540] Yet he had not spoken all his words, and they came. The two men[541] dismounted to the ground, and their companions rejoicing[542] congratulated them with clasped hands and with words of welcome.[543] First to question them was the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:[544] “Come, tell me, honoured Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians,[545] how did you win these horses? Did you go into the great company  p 122  [546] of the Trojans, or did some god meet you and give them to you?[547] They shine, like the rays of the sun, terribly. Yet over and over[548] I encounter the Trojans, I say that I am not at all one[549] to hang back beside the ships, though I am an aged fighter.[550] Yet I have never seen horses like these, nor laid eyes upon them.[551] I think it must be some god who met you, and gave them to you.[552] Since both of you are beloved to Zeus who gathers the clouds, both[553] to the grey-eyed maiden of Zeus who wears the aegis, Athene.”[554] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[555] “Son of Neleus, Nestor, great glory of the Achaians:[556] lightly a god, if he wished, could give us horses even better[557] than these, seeing that the gods are far stronger than we are.[558] These horses, aged sir, that you ask about are newcomers[559] from Thrace, and as for their master brave Diomedes killed him[560] and at his side killed twelve companions, all of them great men;[561] our thirteenth man killed was their scout, here by the vessels,[562] one whom Hektor and the rest of the haughty Trojans[563] had sent out between the lines to spy on our army.”[564] He spoke, and guided across the ditch the single-foot horses[565] laughing aloud, and the rest of the Achaians went with him[566] rejoicing. When they came to Diomedes’ strong-fashioned shelter[567] there they tied up the horses by the carefully cut reins[568] by the horse trough where already the horses of Diomedes[569] were standing, rapid of foot, and eating their welcome provender.[570] And by the stern of the ship Odysseus laid down the bloody[571] battle spoils of Dolon, to dedicate to Athene.[572] And the men themselves waded into the sea and washed off[573] the dense sweat from shin and shoulder and thigh. Afterwards[574] when the surf of the sea had rinsed the dense-running sweat away[575] from all their skin, and the inward heart had been cooled to refreshment,[576] they stepped into the bathtubs smooth-polished, and bathed there,[577] and after they had bathed and anointed themselves with olive oil[578] they sat down to dine, and from the full mixing-bowl drawing[579] the sweet-hearted wine poured out an offering to Athene.book eleven[1] Now Dawn rose from her bed, where she lay by haughty Tithonos,[2] to carry her light to men and to immortals. Zeus sent down[3] in speed to the fast ships of the Achaians the wearisome goddess[4] of Hate, holding in her hands the portent of battle.[5] She took her place on the huge-hollowed black ship of Odysseus[6] which lay in the middle, so that she could carry out to both flanks,[7] either as far as the shelters of Telamonian Aias[8] or to those of Achilleus; since these had hauled their balanced ships up[9] at the ends, certain of their manhood and their hands’ strength.[10] There the goddess took her place, and cried out a great cry[11] and terrible and loud, and put strength in all the Achaians’[12] hearts, to go on tirelessly with their fighting of battles.[13] And now battle became sweeter to them than to go back[14] in their hollow ships to the beloved land of their fathers.[15] And Atreus’ son cried out aloud and drove the Achaians  p 123  [16] to gird them, while he himself put the shining bronze upon him.[17] First he placed along his legs the beautiful greaves linked[18] with silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.[19] Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet[20] that Kinyras had given him once, to be a guest present.[21] For the great fame and rumour of war had carried to Kypros[22] how the Achaians were to sail against Troy in their vessels.[23] Therefore he gave the king as a gift of grace this corselet.[24] Now there were ten circles of deep cobalt upon it,[25] and twelve of gold and twenty of tin. And toward the opening[26] at the throat there were rearing up three serpents of cobalt[27] on either side, like rainbows, which the son of Kronos[28] has marked upon the clouds, to be a portent to mortals.[29] Across his shoulders he slung the sword, and the nails upon it[30] were golden and glittered, and closing about it the scabbard[31] was silver, and gold was upon the swordstraps that held it.[32] And he took up the man-enclosing elaborate stark shield,[33] a thing of splendour. There were ten circles of bronze upon it,[34] and set about it were twenty knobs of tin, pale-shining,[35] and in the very centre another knob of dark cobalt.[36] And circled in the midst of all was the blank-eyed face of the Gorgon[37] with her stare of horror, and Fear was inscribed upon it, and Terror.[38] The strap of the shield had silver upon it, and there also on it[39] was coiled a cobalt snake, and there were three heads upon him[40] twisted to look backward and grown from a single neck, all three.[41] Upon his head he set the helmet, two-horned, four-sheeted,[42] with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.[43] Then he caught up two strong spears edged with sharp bronze[44] and the brazen heads flashed far from him deep into heaven.[45] And Hera and Athena caused a crash of thunder about him,[46] doing honour to the lord of deep-golden Mykenai.[47] Thereupon each man gave orders to his charioteer[48] to rein in the horses once again by the ditch, in good order,[49] while they themselves, dismounted and armed in their war gear, swept onward[50] to the ditch, and their incessant clamour rose up in the morning.[51] In battle array they came to the ditch well ahead of the horseman[52] and the horseman followed a little behind. And the son of Kronos[53] drove down the evil turmoil upon them, and from aloft cast[54] down dews dripping blood from the sky, since he was minded[55] to hurl down a multitude of strong heads to the house of Hades.[56] On the other side of the ditch at the break of the plain the Trojans[57] gathered about tall Hektor and stately Poulydamas[58] and Aineias, honoured by Trojans in their countryside as a god is,[59] and the three sons of Antenor, Polybos, and brilliant Agenor,[60] and Akamas, a young man still, in the likeness of the immortals.[61] And Hektor carried the perfect circle of his shield in the foremost,[62] as among the darkened clouds the bale star shows forth[63] in all shining, then merges again in the clouds and the darkness.[64] So Hektor would at one time be shining among the foremost,[65] and then once more urging on the last, and complete in bronze armour[66] glittered like the thunder-flash of Zeus of the aegis, our father.[67] And the men, like two lines of reapers who, facing each other,  p 124  [68] drive their course all down the field of wheat or of barley[69] for a man blessed in substance, and the cut swathes drop showering,[70] so Trojans and Achaians driving in against one another[71] cut men down, nor did either side think of disastrous panic.[72] The pressure held their heads on a line, and they whirled and fought like[73] wolves, and Hate, the Lady of Sorrow, was gladdened to watch them.[74] She alone of all the immortals attended this action[75] but the other immortals were not there, but sat quietly[76] remote and apart in their palaces, where for each one of them[77] a house had been built in splendour along the folds of Olympos.[78] All were blaming the son of Kronos, Zeus of the dark mists,[79] because his will was to give glory to the Trojans. To these gods[80] the father gave no attention at all, but withdrawn from them[81] and rejoicing in the pride of his strength sat apart from the others[82] looking out over the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaians,[83] watching the flash of the bronze, and men killing and men killed.[84] So long as it was early morning and sacred daylight increasing,[85] so long the thrown weapons of both took hold and men dropped under them.[86] But at that time when the woodcutter makes ready his supper[87] in the wooded glens of the mountains, when his arms and hands have grown weary[88] from cutting down the tall trees, and his heart has had enough of it,[89] and longing for food and sweet wine takes hold of his senses;[90] at that time the Danaans by their manhood broke the battalions[91] calling across the ranks to each other. First Agamemnon[92] drove on, and killed a man, Bienor, shepherd of the people,[93] himself, then his companion Oïleus, lasher of horses;[94] who, springing down from behind his horses, stood forth to face him,[95] but Agamemnon stabbed straight at his face as he came on in fury[96] with the sharp spear, nor did helm’s bronze-heavy edge hold it,[97] but the spearhead passed through this and the bone, and the inward[98] brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury,[99] and Agamemnon the lord of men left them lying there[100] and their white bodies showing, since he had stripped off their tunics.[101] Then he went on to kill and strip Isos and Antiphos,[102] two sons of Priam, bastard one and one lawful, both riding[103] in a single chariot. The bastard, Isos, was charioteer[104] and renowned Antiphos rode beside him. Before this Achilleus[105] had caught these two at the knees of Ida, and bound them in pliant[106] willows as they watched by their sheep, and released them for ransom.[107] This time the son of Atreus, wide-powerful Agamemnon,[108] struck Isos with the thrown spear in the chest above the nipple[109] and hit Antiphos by the ear with the sword and hurled him from his horses,[110] and in eager haste stripped off from these their glorious armour[111] which he knew; he had seen these two before by the fast ships[112] when Achilleus of the swift feet had brought them in from Ida.[113] And as a lion seizes the innocent young of the running[114] deer, and easily crunches and breaks them caught in the strong teeth[115] when he has invaded their lair, and rips out the soft heart from them,[116] and even if the doe be very near, still she has no strength[117] to help, for the ghastly shivers of fear are upon her also  p 125  [118] and suddenly she dashes away through the glades and the timber[119] sweating in her speed away from the pounce of the strong beast;[120] so there was no one of the Trojans who could save these two[121] from death, but they themselves were running in fear from the Argives.[122] Next he caught Peisandros and Hippolochos stubborn in battle,[123] sons of Antimachos the wise, who beyond all others[124] had taken the gold of Alexandros, glorious gifts, so that[125] he had opposed the return of Helen to fair-haired Menelaos.[126] Powerful Agamemnon caught his two sons riding[127] in one chariot, who together guided the running horses.[128] Now the glittering reins escaped from the hands of both of them[129] and they were stunned with fear, for against them rose like a lion[130] Atreus’ son, and they supplicated him out of the chariot:[131] “Take us alive, son of Atreus, and take appropriate ransom.[132] In the house of Antimachos the treasures lie piled in abundance,[133] bronze is there, and gold, and difficulty wrought iron,[134] and our father would make you glad with abundant repayment[135] were he to hear we were alive by the ships of the Achaians.”[136] Thus these two cried out upon the king, lamenting[137] and in pitiful phrase, but they heard the voice that was without pity:[138] “If in truth you are the sons of wise Antimachos,[139] that man who once among the Trojans assembled advised them[140] that Menelaos, who came as envoy with godlike Odysseus,[141] should be murdered on the spot nor let go back to the Achaians,[142] so now your mutilation shall punish the shame of your father.”[143] He spoke, and spurned Peisandros to the ground from the chariot[144] with a spear-stroke in the chest, and he crashed on his back to the ground. Then[145] Hippolochos sprang away, but Atreides killed him dismounted,[146] cutting away his arms with a sword-stroke, free of the shoulder,[147] and sent him spinning like a log down the battle. Thereafter[148] he left them, and toward that place where the most battalions were shaken[149] drove, and beside him drove the rest of the strong-greaved Achaians,[150] and footmen killed footmen who fled under strong compulsion[151] and riders killed riders, and a storm of dust rose up under them[152] out of the plain uplifted by the thundering feet of their horses.[153] They killed with the bronze, and among them powerful Agamemnon[154] went onward always slaying and urged on the rest of the Argives.[155] As when obliterating fire comes down on the timbered forest[156] and the roll of the wind carries it everywhere, and bushes[157] leaning under the force of the fire’s rush tumble uprooted,[158] so before Atreus’ son Agamemnon went down the high heads[159] of the running Trojans, and in many places the strong-necked horses[160] rattled their empty chariots along the causeways of battle,[161] and longed for their haughty charioteers, who were lying[162] along the ground, to delight no longer their wives, but the vultures.[163] But Zeus drew Hektor out from under the dust and the missiles,[164] out of the place where men were killed, the blood and confusion,[165] while Atreides followed urging the Danaans forever onward.[166] The Trojans swept in their flight past the barrow of ancient Ilos[167] Dardanos’ son, to the centre of the level ground and the fig tree,[168] as they made for the city, and he followed them always, screaming,  p 126  [169] Atreus’ son, his invincible hands spattered with bloody filth.[170] But when they had made their way to the Skaian gates and the oak tree[171] the Trojans stood their ground, and each side endured the other,[172] while others still in the middle plain stampeded like cattle[173] when a lion, coming upon them in the dim night, has terrified[174] the whole herd, while for a single one sheer death is emerging.[175] First the lion breaks her neck caught fast in the strong teeth,[176] then gulps down the blood and all the guts that are inward;[177] so Atreus’ son, powerful Agamemnon, went after them[178] killing ever the last of the men; and they fled in terror.[179] Many were hurled from behind their horses, face downward or sprawling[180] under the hands of Atreides who raged with his spear in the forefront.[181] But when he was on the point of making his way to the city[182] and the steep wall, the father of gods and of men descending[183] out of the sky took his place along the ridges of Ida[184] of the fountains, and held fast in his hands the thunderbolt.[185] He sent on her way Iris of the golden wings with a message:[186] “Go on your way, swift Iris, and carry my word to Hektor:[187] as long as he beholds Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[188] raging among the champions and cutting down the ranged fighters,[189] so long let him hold back and urge on the rest of his people[190] to fight against the enemy through this strong encounter.[191] But when, either struck with a spear or hit by a flying arrow,[192] he springs up behind his horses, then I guarantee power to Hektor[193] to kill men, till he makes his way to the strong-benched vessels,[194] until the sun goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.”[195] He spoke, and swift wind-footed Iris did not disobey him,[196] but went down along the hills of Ida to sacred Ilion,[197] and found the son of wise Priam, Hektor the brilliant,[198] standing among the compacted chariots and by the horses.[199] Iris the swift of foot came close beside and spoke to him:[200] “Hektor, o son of Priam and equal of Zeus in counsel,[201] Zeus my father has sent me down to tell you this message.[202] As long as you behold Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[203] raging among the champions and cutting down the ranged fighters,[204] so long hold back from the fighting, but urge on the rest of your people[205] to fight against the enemy through this strong encounter.[206] But when, either struck with a spear or hit by a flying arrow,[207] he springs up behind his horses, then Zeus guarantees power to you[208] to kill men, till you make your way to the strong-benched vessels,[209] until the son goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.”[210] Swift-foot Iris spoke to him thus and went away from him,[211] and Hektor in all his armour leapt to the ground from his chariot[212] and shaking two sharp spears in his hand ranged over the whole host[213] stirring them up to fight and waking the ghastly warfare.[214] So they whirled about and stood their ground against the Achaians,[215] and the Argives against them pulled together their battle lines.[216] So the fighting grew close and they faced each other, and foremost[217] Agamemnon drove on, trying to fight far ahead of all others.[218] Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,[219] who was the first to come forth and stand against Agamemnon[220] of the very Trojans, or their renowned companions in battle.  p 127  [221] Iphidamas, Antenor’s son, the huge and stalwart[222] who had been reared in generous Thrace, the mother of sheepflocks.[223] Kisseus had raised him in his own house when he was little,[224] his mother’s father, whose child was Theano, the girl of the fair cheeks.[225] But when he had arrived at the stature of powerful manhood[226] Kisseus detained him there and gave him his daughter. Married[227] he went away from the bride chamber, looking for glory[228] from the Achaians, with twelve curved ships that followed with him.[229] These balanced vessels he had left behind in Perkote[230] and gone himself to fight on foot at Ilion; and there[231] he came face to face with Atreus’ son, Agamemnon.[232] Now when these in their advance were close to each other[233] the son of Atreus missed with his throw, and the spear was turned past him,[234] but Iphidamas stabbed to the belt underneath the corselet[235] and leaned in on the stroke in the confidence of his strong hand[236] but could not get clean through the bright war belt, far sooner[237] the spearpoint pushed against the silver bent back, like soft lead.[238] And in his hand wide-powerful Agamemnon catching it[239] dragged it against him, raging like a lion, and tore it[240] out of his hand, then struck the neck with his sword, and unstrung him.[241] So Iphidamas fell there and went into the brazen slumber,[242] unhappy, who came to help his own people, and left his young wife[243] a bride, and had known no delight from her yet, and given much for her.[244] First he had given a hundred oxen, then promised a thousand[245] head of goats and sheep, which were herded for him in abundance.[246] Now Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stripped him and went back[247] to the throng of the Achaians bearing the splendid armour.[248] When Koön, conspicuous among the fighters, perceived him,[249] he who was Antenor’s eldest born, the strong sorrow[250] misted about his eyes for the sake of his fallen brother.[251] He came from the side and unobserved at great Agamemnon[252] and stabbed with his spear at the middle arm, underneath the elbow,[253] and the head of the glittering spear cut its way clean through.[254] Agamemnon the lord of men shuddered with fear then[255] but even so did not give up the attack or his fighting[256] but sprang at Koön, gripping a spear that struck with the wind’s speed.[257] Now Koön was dragging his father’s son, his brother Iphidamas,[258] by the foot back eagerly, and cried out on all the bravest,[259] but as he dragged him into the crowd, Agamemnon thrust at him[260] with the smoothed bronze spear underneath the knobbed shield, and unstrung him,[261] then came up and hewed off his head over Iphidamas.[262] There under the king, Atreus’ son, the sons of Antenor[263] filled out their destiny and went down to the house of the death god.[264] But Agamemnon ranged the ranks of the other fighters[265] with spear and sword and with huge stones that he flung, for such time[266] as the blood was still running warm from the spear-wound.[267] But after the sore place was dry, and the flow of blood stopped,[268] the sharp pains began to break in on the strength of Atreides.[269] As the sharp sorrow of pain descends on a woman in labour,[270] the bitterness that the hard spirits of childbirth bring on,[271] Hera’s daughters, who hold the power of the bitter birthpangs,  p 128  [272] so the sharp pains began to break in on the strength of Atreides.[273] He sprang back into the car, and called to his charioteer[274] to drive him back to the hollow ships, since his heart was heavy.[275] He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:[276] “Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,[277] you must still continue to defend our seafaring vessels[278] from the wearying attack, since Zeus of the counsels would not[279] allow me to do battle daylong against the Trojans.”[280] He spoke, and the charioteer lashed on the bright-maned horses[281] back toward the hollow ships, and they winged their way unreluctant.[282] The foam ran down their chests, they were powdered with dust from beneath them[283] as they carried the stricken king away from the fighting.[284] When Hektor was aware of Agamemnon withdrawing[285] he called out in a great voice to Trojans and Lykians:[286] “Trojans, Lykians and Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[287] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.[288] Their best man is gone, and Zeus, Kronos’ son, has consented[289] to my great glory; but steer your single-foot horses straight on[290] at the powerful Danaans, so win you the higher glory.”[291] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[292] As when some huntsman drives to action his hounds with shining[293] teeth against some savage beast, wild boar or lion,[294] so against the Achaians Hektor the son of Priam,[295] a man like the murderous war god, lashed on the high-hearted Trojans.[296] And he himself with high thoughts strode out in the foremost[297] and hurled himself on the struggle of men like a high-blown storm-cloud[298] which swoops down from above to trouble the blue sea-water.[299] Who then was the first, and who the last that he slaughtered,[300] Hektor, Priam’s son, now that Zeus granted him glory?[301] Asaios first, and then Autonoös and Opites,[302] and Dolops, Klytios’ son, Opheltios and Agelaos,[303] and Aisymnos, and Oros, and Hipponoös stubborn in battle.[304] He killed these, who were lords of the Danaans, and thereafter[305] the multitude, as when the west wind strikes in the deepening[306] whirlstorm to batter the clouds of the shining south wind,[307] so that the bulging big waves roll hard and the blown spume[308] scatters high before the force of the veering wind’s blast.[309] So the massed high heads of the people were struck down by Hektor.[310] And now there might have been havoc and hopeless things done, now[311] the running Achaians might have tumbled back into their own ships[312] had not Odysseus cried out to Tydeus’ son, Diomedes:[313] “Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we have forgotten[314] our fighting strength? Come here and stand with me, brother. There must be[315] shame on us, if Hektor of the glancing helm captures our vessels.”[316] Then in answer powerful Diomedes spoke to him:[317] “Yes, I will stand with you and take what I must, yet[318] we shall not have our way for long, since Zeus the cloud-gatherer[319] would wish to give the power to the Trojans rather than to us.”[320] He spoke, and hurled down Thymbraios to the ground from his horses[321] with a stroke of the spear by the left nipple. Meanwhile Odysseus[322] killed this lord of battle’s henchman, godlike Molion.  p 129  [323] They left these to lie there, since they had ended their fighting,[324] then went into the ranks and wrought havoc, as when two wild boars[325] hurl themselves in their pride upon the hounds who pursue them.[326] So they whirled on the Trojans again and destroyed them. Meanwhile[327] the Achaians gladly drew breath again after their flight from great Hektor.[328] There they took a chariot and two men, lords in their countryside,[329] sons both of Merops of Perkote, who beyond all men[330] knew the art of prophecy, and tried to prevent his two sons[331] from going into the battle where men die. Yet these would not[332] listen, for the spirits of dark death were driving them onward.[333] Tydeus’ son, Diomedes of the renowned spear, stripped them[334] of life and spirit, and took away their glorious armour[335] while Odysseus killed Hypeirochos and Hippodamos.[336] There the son of Kronos strained the battle even between them[337] as he looked down from Ida. They went on killing each other.[338] Now Tydeus’ son stabbed with the spear Agastrophos, a chief[339] and son of Paion, striking at the hip joint. His horses[340] were not by for his escape, but he, strongly infatuate,[341] had a henchman holding them aside, while he, dismounted,[342] raged on among the champions until so he lost his dear life.[343] Hektor saw it sharply across the ranks and rose up against them[344] with a great cry, and behind him came on the Trojan battalions.[345] Diomedes of the great war cry shivered as he saw him[346] and suddenly he spoke to Odysseus as he came near:[347] “Here is this curse, Hektor the huge, wheeling down upon us.[348] Let us stand, and hold our ground against him, and beat him off from us.”[349] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it[350] aiming at the head, and struck against his mark, nor missed it,[351] at the high peak of the helm, but the bronze from the bronze was driven[352] back, nor reached his shining skin, the helmet guarded it,[353] three-ply and hollow-eyed, which Phoibos Apollo gave him.[354] But Hektor sprang far away back and merged among his own people,[355] and dropping to one knee stayed leaning on the ground with his heavy[356] hand, and a covering of black night came over both eyes.[357] But while the son of Tydeus was following his spear’s cast[358] far through the front fighters where it fixed in the earth, meanwhile[359] Hektor got his wind again, and springing back into his chariot[360] drove back into the multitude and avoided the dark death.[361] Then shaking his spear powerful Diomedes called to him:[362] “Once again now you escaped death, dog. And yet the evil[363] came near you, but now once more Phoibos Apollo has saved you,[364] he to whom you must pray when you go into the thunder of spears thrown.[365] Yet I may win you, if I encounter you ever hereafter,[366] if beside me also there is some god who will help me.[367] Now I must chase whoever I can overtake of the others.”[368] He spoke, and set about stripping the spear-famed son of Paion.[369] But now Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,[370] pulled his bow against Tydeus’ son, the shepherd of the people,[371] leaning against the column, work of men’s hand, on the gravemound[372] of Ilos, Dardanos’ son, an elder of the folk in the old days.[373] Now Diomedes was stripping the corselet of strong Agastrophos[374] from about his chest, and the shining shield from his shoulders[375] and the heavy helm, as the other pulled his bow at the handgrip  p 130  [376] and shot, and the arrow escaping his hand flew not vain[377] but struck the flat of the right foot, and the shaft driven clean through[378] stuck in the ground. Then Alexandros, laughing merrily,[379] sprang from his hiding-place and cried out his speech of triumph:[380] “You are hit, and my arrow flew not in vain. How I wish[381] I had struck you in the depth of the belly and torn the life from you.[382] So the Trojans, who shudder before you as bleating goats do[383] before a lion, would have got their wind again after disaster.”[384] Then not at all frightened strong Diomedes answered him:[385] “You archer, foul fighter, lovely in your locks, eyer of young girls.[386] If you were to make trial of me in strong combat with weapons[387] your bow would do you no good at all, nor your close-showered arrows.[388] Now you have scratched the flat of my foot, and even boast of this.[389] I care no more than if a witless child or a woman[390] had struck me; this is the blank weapon of a useless man, no fighter.[391] But if one is struck by me only a little, that is far different,[392] the stroke is a sharp thing and suddenly lays him lifeless,[393] and that man’s wife goes with cheeks torn in lamentation,[394] and his children are fatherless, while he staining the soil with his red blood[395] rots away, and there are more birds than women swarming about him.”[396] He spoke, and Odysseus the spear-famed coming up from nearby[397] stood in front; so he sat down behind him and pulled out[398] the sharp arrow from his foot, and the hard pain came over his flesh.[399] He sprang back into the car and called to his charioteer[400] to drive him back to the hollow ships, since his heart was heavy.[401] Now Odysseus the spear-famed was left alone, nor did any[402] of the Argives stay beside him, since fear had taken all of them.[403] And troubled, he spoke then to his own great-hearted spirit:[404] “Ah me, what will become of me? It will be great evil[405] if I run, fearing their multitude, yet deadlier if I am caught[406] alone; and Kronos’ son drove to flight the rest of the Danaans.[407] Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?[408] Since I know that it is the cowards who walk out of the fighting,[409] but if one is to win honour in battle, he must by all means[410] stand his ground strongly, whether he be struck or strike down another.”[411] While he was pondering these things in his heart and his spirit[412] the ranks of the armoured Trojans came on against him, and penned him[413] in their midst, but made thereby a wound in their ranks, as when[414] closing about a wild boar the hounds and the lusty young men[415] rush him, and he comes out of his lair in the deep of a thicket[416] grinding to an edge the white fangs in the crook of the jawbones,[417] and these sweep in all about him, and the vaunt of his teeth uprises[418] as they await him, terrible though he is, without wavering;[419] so closing on Odysseus beloved of Zeus the Trojans[420] rushed him. First he stabbed lordly Deïopites[421] in the shoulder, lunging from above with a stroke of the sharp spear,[422] and after him he killed Thoön and Ennomos, and next[423] stabbed Chersidamas as he sprang down from behind his horses[424] in the navel with a spear’s stroke underneath the massive[425] shield, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground with his hand. These[426] he left lying, and stabbed with the spear the son of Hippasos,[427] Charops, full brother of Sokos, a man rich in substance. And Sokos[428] moved in, a man like a god, to stand over his fallen brother  p 131  [429] and came and stood close by Odysseus and spoke a word to him:[430] “Honoured Odysseus, insatiable of guile and endeavour,[431] today you will have two sons of Hippasos to vaunt over[432] for having killed two such men as we and stripping our armour,[433] or else, stricken underneath my spear, you might lose your own life.”[434] He spoke, and stabbed Odysseus’ shield in its perfect circle.[435] All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead[436] and crashed its way through the intricately wrought corselet,[437] and all the skin was torn away from his ribs, yet Pallas[438] Athene would not let the point penetrate the man’s vitals.[439] Odysseus saw that the fatal end had not yet come to him,[440] and drew back and spoke a word to Sokos: “Ah, wretch,[441] surely now steep destruction is advancing upon you.[442] It is true, you have stopped my fighting against the Trojans,[443] but I declare that here and now dark death and slaughter[444] will come upon you this day, and that beaten down under my spear[445] you will give glory to me and your life to Hades of the horses.”[446] He spoke, and Sokos turning from him was striding in flight[447] but in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed[448] between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.[449] He fell, thunderously, and great Odysseus boasted over him:[450] “Sokos, son of wise Hippasos the breaker of horses,[451] death was too quick for you and ran you down, you could not[452] avoid it. Wretch, since now your father and your honoured mother[453] will not be able to close your eyes in death, but the tearing[454] birds will get you, with their wings close-beating about you.[455] If I die, the brilliant Achaians will bury me in honour.”[456] So he spoke, and dragged the heavy spear of wise Sokos[457] out of his flesh and out of the shield massive in the middle,[458] and as it was torn out the blood sprang and his heart was sickened.[459] But the great-hearted Trojans, when they saw the blood of Odysseus,[460] cried aloud through the close battle and all made a charge against him.[461] He gave back a little way and called out for his companions.[462] Three times he called, as much voice as a man’s head could hold,[463] and three times Menelaos the warlike heard him shouting[464] and immediately spoke to Aias, who was near by him:[465] “Son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, Aias, lord of the people,[466] the war cry of patient Odysseus is ringing about me[467] with a sound as if he had been cut off by himself, and the Trojans[468] were handling him violently in the strong encounter. Therefore[469] let us go to him through the battle. It is better to defend him against them.[470] I fear that, caught alone, he may be hurt by the Trojans[471] brave as he is, and so a great loss may befall the Danaans.”[472] He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal[473] like a god. They found Odysseus beloved of Zeus, and around him[474] the Trojans crowded, as bloody scavengers in the mountains[475] crowd on a horned stag who is stricken, one whom a hunter[476] shot with an arrow from the string, and the stag has escaped him, running[477] with his feet, while the blood stayed warm, and his knees were springing beneath him.[478] But when the pain of the flying arrow has beaten him, then[479] the rending scavengers begin to feast on him in the mountains[480] and the shaded glen. But some spirit leads that way a dangerous  p 132  [481] lion, and the scavengers run in terror, and the lion eats it;[482] so about wise much-devising Odysseus the Trojans[483] crowded now, valiant and numerous, but the hero[484] with rapid play of his spear beat off the pitiless death-day.[485] Now Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield,[486] and stood forth beside him, and the Trojans fled one way and another.[487] Then taking Odysseus by the hand warlike Menelaos[488] led him from the battle, while his henchman drove the horses close up.[489] But Aias leaping upon the Trojans struck down Doryklos,[490] Priam’s son, but a bastard, and thereafter stabbed Pandokos,[491] and so also Lysandros and Pyrasos and Pylartes.[492] As when a swollen river hurls its water, big with rain,[493] down the mountains to the flat land following rain from the sky god,[494] and sweeps down with it numbers of dry oaks and of pine trees[495] numbers, until it hurls its huge driftwood into the salt sea;[496] so now glittering Aias cumbered the plain as he chased them,[497] slaughtering men and horses alike, nor yet had Hektor[498] heard, since he was fighting at the left of the entire battle[499] by the banks of Skamandros river, where more than elsewhere[500] the high heads of men were dropping, and the tireless clamour[501] rising about tall Nestor and Idomeneus the warlike.[502] Now Hektor was encountering these and doing grim work[503] with spear and horsemanship, ruining the battalions of young men.[504] Yet even so the Achaians would not have given from his path[505] had not Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,[506] stayed from his bravery the shepherd of the people, Machaon,[507] hitting him with a three-barbed arrow in the right shoulder.[508] And the Achaians whose wind was fury were frightened for him,[509] that the enemy might catch him in the backturn of the fighting.[510] At once Idomeneus called out to brilliant Nestor:[511] “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,[512] quick, get up on your chariot, let Machaon beside you[513] mount, and steer your single-foot horses to the ships in all speed.[514] A healer is a man worth many men in his knowledge[515] of cutting out arrows and putting kindly medicines on wounds.”[516] He spoke, and the Gerenian horseman Nestor obeyed him.[517] Immediately he mounted the chariot, and Machaon,[518] son of the great healer Asklepios, mounted beside him.[519] He lashed on the horses, and they winged their way unreluctant[520] back toward the hollow ships, since this was the way they desired.[521] Now Kebriones, who saw how the Trojans were being driven,[522] and who stood beside Hektor in the chariot, spoke a word to him:[523] “Hektor, you and I encounter the Danaans at the utmost[524] edge of the sorrowful battle, but meanwhile the rest of the Trojans[525] are driven pell-mell upon each other, the men and their horses.[526] The Telamonian Aias drives them; I know him surely[527] for he carries the broad shield on his shoulders. So, let us also[528] steer our horses and chariot that way, since there the horsemen[529] and the foot-ranks more than elsewhere hurling the wicked war-hate[530] against each other, are destroying, and the ceaseless clamour has risen.”[531] So he spoke, and lashed forward the bright-maned horses[532] with the singing whip, and they at the feel of the stroke lightly  p 133  [533] carried the running chariot among Achaians and Trojans,[534] trampling down dead men and shields, and the axle under[535] the chariot was all splashed with blood and the rails which encircled[536] the chariot, stuck by flying drops from the feet of the horses,[537] from the running rims of the wheels. So Hektor was straining to plunge in[538] the turmoil of men, and charge them and break them. He hurled the confusion[539] of disaster upon the Danaans, and stayed from the spear’s stroke[540] little, but with his spear and his sword and with huge stones flung[541] ranged about among the ranks of the rest of the fighters[542] yet kept clear still of the attack of Telamonian Aias.[543] But Zeus father who sits on high drove fear upon Aias.[544] He stood stunned, and swung the sevenfold ox-hide shield behind him[545] and drew back, throwing his eyes round the crowd of men, like a wild beast[546] turning on his way, shifting knee past knee only a little;[547] as when the men who live in the wild and their dogs have driven[548] a tawny lion away from the mid-fenced ground of their oxen,[549] and wild not let him tear out the fat of the oxen, watching[550] nightlong against him, and he in his hunger for meat closes in[551] but can get nothing of what he wants, for the raining javelins[552] thrown from the daring hands of the men beat ever against him,[553] and the flaming torches, and these he balks at for all of his fury[554] and with the daylight goes away, disappointed of desire;[555] so Aias, disappointed at heart, drew back from the Trojans[556] much unwilling, but feared for the ships of the Achaians. As when[557] a donkey, stubborn and hard to move, goes into a cornfield[558] in despite of boys, and many sticks have been broken upon him,[559] but he gets in and goes on eating the deep grain, and the children[560] beat him with sticks, but their strength is infantile; yet at last[561] by hard work they drive him out when he is glutted with eating;[562] so the high-hearted Trojans and companions in arms gathered[563] from far places kept after great Aias, the son of Telamon,[564] stabbing always with their spears at the centre of the great shield.[565] And now Aias would remember again his furious valour[566] and turn upon them, and beat back the battalions of Trojans,[567] breakers of horses, and then again would turn and run from them.[568] He blocked them all from making their way on to the fast ships[569] and himself stood and fought on in the space between the Achaians[570] and Trojans, and of the spears thrown by the daring hands of the fighters[571] some that were driven forward stuck fast in the great shield, others[572] and many in the mid space before they had got to his white skin[573] stood fast in the ground, though they had been straining to reach his body.[574] Now as Eurypylos the glorious son of Euaimon[575] saw how Aias was being overpowered by the dense spears,[576] he came and stood beside him and made a cast with his bright spear[577] and struck Apisaon, son of Phausias, shepherd of the people,[578] in the liver under the midriff, and at once took the strength from his knees.[579] Eurypylos springing forward stripped the armour from his shoulders[580] but godlike Alexandros watched him as he was stripping[581] the armour of Apisaon, and at once drew his bow, and shot[582] at Eurypylos, and hit him in the right thigh with the arrow,[583] and the reed shaft was broken off, and his thigh was heavy with pain.  p 134  [584] To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions.[585] He lifted his voice and called in piercing cry to the Danaans:[586] “Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,[587] turn again and stand and beat off the pitiless death-day[588] from Aias, who is being overpowered with spears thrown; and I think[589] he cannot escape out of this sorrowful battle. Therefore[590] stand fast and face them around great Aias, the son of Telamon.”[591] So spoke wounded Eurypylos, and the others about him[592] stood in their numbers and sloped their shields over his shoulders, holding[593] the spears away, and Aias came back to join them. He turned[594] and stood, when he had got back to the swarm of his own companions.[595] So they fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. And meanwhile[596] the horses of Neleus sweating carried Nestor away from[597] the fighting, and carried also the shepherd of the people, Machaon.[598] Now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus saw him and watched him,[599] for he was standing on the stern of his huge-hollowed vessel[600] looking out over the sheer war work and the sorrowful onrush.[601] At once he spoke to his own companion in arms, Patroklos,[602] calling from the ship, and he heard it from inside the shelter, and came out[603] like the war god, and this was the beginning of his evil.[604] The strong son of Menoitios spoke first, and addressed him:[605] “What do you wish with me, Achilleus? Why do you call me?”[606] Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[607] “Son of Menoitios, you who delight my heart, o great one,[608] now I think the Achaians will come to my knees and stay there[609] in supplication, for a need past endurance has come to them.[610] But go now, Patroklos beloved of Zeus, to Nestor[611] and ask him who is this wounded man he brings in from the fighting.[612] Indeed, seeing him from behind I thought he was like Machaon,[613] Asklepios’ son, in all ways, but I got no sight of the man’s face[614] since the horses were tearing forward and swept on by me.”[615] So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion[616] and went on the run along the shelters and ships of the Achaians.[617] Now when the others came to the shelter of the son of Neleus,[618] they themselves dismounted to the prospering earth, and the henchman[619] Eurymedon unharnessed the horses of the old man[620] from the chariot. The men wiped off the sweat on their tunics[621] and stood to the wind beside the beach of the sea, and thereafter[622] went inside the shelter and took their places on settles.[623] And lovely-haired Hekamede made them a potion, she whom[624] the old man won from Tenedos, when Achilleus stormed it.[625] She was the daughter of great-hearted Arsinoös. The Achaians[626] chose her out for Nestor, because he was best of them all in counsel.[627] First she pushed up the table in front of them, a lovely[628] table, polished and with feet of cobalt, and on it[629] she laid a bronze basket, with onion to go with the drinking,[630] and pale honey, and beside it bread, blessed pride of the barley,[631] and beside it a beautifully wrought cup which the old man brought with him[632] from home. It was set with golden nails, the eared handles upon it[633] were four, and on either side there were fashioned two doves[634] of gold, feeding, and there were double bases beneath it.[635] Another man with great effort could lift it full from the table,  p 135  [636] but Nestor, aged as he was, lifted it without strain.[637] In this the woman like the immortals mixed them a potion[638] with Pramneian wine, and grated goat’s-milk cheese into it[639] with a bronze grater, and scattered with her hand white barley into it.[640] When she had got the potion ready, she told them to drink it,[641] and both when they had drunk it were rid of their thirst’s parching[642] and began to take pleasure in conversation, talking with each other,[643] and Patroklos came and stood, a godlike man, in the doorway.[644] Seeing him the old man started up from his shining[645] chair, and took him by the hand, led him in and told him to sit down,[646] but Patroklos from the other side declined, and spoke to him:[647] “No chair, aged sir beloved of Zeus. You will not persuade me.[648] Honoured, and quick to blame, is the man who sent me to find out[649] who was this wounded man you were bringing. Now I myself[650] know, and I see it is Machaon, the shepherd of the people.[651] Now I go back as messenger to Achilleus, to tell him.[652] You know yourself, aged sir beloved of Zeus, how he is;[653] a dangerous man; he might even be angry with one who is guiltless.”[654] Then in turn the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:[655] “Now why is Achilleus being so sorry for the sons of the Achaians[656] who have been wounded with spears thrown, he who knows nothing[657] of the sorrow that has risen along the host, since the bravest[658] are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds?[659] The son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes, was hit by an arrow,[660] and Odysseus has a pike wound, and Agamemnon the spear-famed,[661] and Eurypylos has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow. And even now[662] I have brought this other one, Machaon, out of the fighting[663] hit by an arrow from the bowstring. Meanwhile Achilleus[664] brave as he is cares nothing for the Danaans nor pities them.[665] Is he going to wait then till the running ships by the water[666] are burned with consuming fire for all the Argives can do, till[667] we ourselves are killed one after another? Since there is not[668] any longer in my gnarled limbs the strength that there once was.[669] If only I were young now, and the strength still steady within me,[670] as that time when a quarrel was made between us and the Eleians[671] over a driving of cattle, when I myself killed Itymoneus,[672] the brave son of Hypeirochos who made his home in Elis.[673] I was driving cattle in reprisal, and he, as he was defending[674] his oxen, was struck among the foremost by a spear thrown from my hand[675] and fell, and his people who live in the wild fled in terror about him.[676] And we got and drove off together much spoil from this pastureland:[677] fifty herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, as many[678] droves of pigs, and again as many wide-ranging goatflocks,[679] and a hundred and fifty brown horses, mares all of them[680] and many with foals following underneath. And all there[681] we drove inside the keep of Neleian Pylos, making[682] our way nightwise to the town. And Neleus was glad in his heart[683] that so much had come my way, who was young to go to the fighting.[684] And next day as dawn showed the heralds lifted their clear cry[685] for all to come who had anything owed them in shining Elis.[686] And the men who were chiefs among the Pylians assembling[687] divided the spoil. There were many to whom the Epeians owed something  p 136  [688] since we in Pylos were few and we had been having the worst of it.[689] For Herakles had come in his strength against us and beaten us[690] in the years before, and all the bravest among us had been killed.[691] For we who were sons of lordly Neleus had been twelve, and now[692] I alone was left of these, and all the others had perished,[693] and grown haughty over this the bronze-armoured Epeians[694] despised and outraged us, and devised wicked actions against us.[695] Now the old man took for himself a herd of cattle and a big flock[696] of sheep, choosing out three hundred of them along with the shepherds;[697] for indeed a great debt was owing to him in shining Elis.[698] It was four horses, race-competitors with their own chariot,[699] who were on their way to a race and were to run for a tripod,[700] but Augeias the lord of men took these, and kept them[701] and sent away their driver who was vexed for the sake of the horses.[702] Now aged Neleus, angry over things said and things done,[703] took a vast amount for himself, and gave the rest to the people[704] to divide among them, so none might go away without a just share.[705] So we administered all this spoil, and all through the city[706] wrought sacrifices to the gods; and on the third day the Epeians[707] came all against us, numbers of men and single-foot horses[708] in full haste, and among them were armoured the two Moliones,[709] boys still, not yet altogether skilled in furious fighting.[710] There is a city, Thryoessa, a headlong hill town[711] far away by the Alpheios at the bottom of sandy Pylos.[712] They had thrown their encampment about that place, furious to smash it.[713] But when they had swept the entire plain, Athene came running[714] to us, a messenger from Olympos by night, and warned us[715] to arm. It was no hesitant host she assembled in Pylos[716] but people straining hard toward the battle. Now Neleus would not[717] let me be armed among them, and had hidden away my horses[718] because he thought I was not yet skilled in the work of warfare.[719] Even so I was pre-eminent among our own horsemen[720] though I went on foot; since thus Athene guided the battle.[721] There is a river, Minyeïos, which empties its water[722] in the sea beside Arene. There we waited for the divine Dawn,[723] we horsemen among the Pylians, and the hordes of the streaming foot-soldiers,[724] and from there having armed in all speed and formed in our armour[725] we came by broad daylight to the sacred stream of Alpheios.[726] There we wrought fine sacrifices to Zeus in his great strength[727] and sacrificed a bull to Alpheios, a bull to Poseidon,[728] but to Athene of the grey eyes a cow from the herds. Then[729] we took our dinner along the host in divided watches[730] and went to sleep, each man in his own armour, by the current[731] of the river, and meanwhile the high-hearted Epeians[732] had taken their places around the city, furious to smash it.[733] But sooner than this there was shown forth a great work of the war god,[734] for when the sun in his shining lifted above the earth, then[735] we joined our battle together, with prayers to Zeus and Athene.[736] Now when the battle came on between Pylians and Epeians,[737] I was first to kill a man, and I won his single-foot horses.[738] It was Moulios the spearman who was son-in-law to Augeias  p 137  [739] and had as wife his eldest daughter, fair-haired Agamede[740] who knew of all the medicines that are grown in the broad earth.[741] As he came on I threw and hit him with the bronze-headed spear[742] and he dropped in the dust, whereupon I springing into his chariot[743] took my place among the champions, as the high-hearted Epeians[744] fled one way and another in terror when they saw the man fall[745] who was leader of their horsemen and the best of them all in fighting.[746] Then I charged upon them like a black whirlwind, and overtook[747] fifty chariots, and for each of the chariots two men[748] caught the dirt in their teeth beaten down under my spear.[749] And now I would have killed the young Moliones, scions[750] of Aktor, had not their father who shakes the earth in his wide strength[751] caught them out of the battle, shrouding them in a thick mist.[752] Then Zeus gave huge power into the hands of the Pylians,[753] for we chased them on over the hollow plain, killing[754] the men themselves, and picking up their magnificent armour[755] until we brought our horses to Bouprasion of the wheatfields[756] and the Olenian rock, where there is a hill called the hill[757] of Alesios. There at last Athene turned back our people.[758] There I killed my last man and left him. There the Achaians[759] steered back from Bouprasion to Pylos their fast-running horses,[760] and all glorified Zeus among the gods, but among men Nestor.[761] That was I, among men, if it ever happened. But Achilleus[762] will enjoy his own valour in loneliness, though I think[763] he will weep much, too late, when his people are perished from him.[764] Dear child, surely this was what Menoitios told you[765] that day when he sent you out from Phthia to Agamemnon.[766] We two, brilliant Odysseus and I, were inside with you[767] and listened carefully to everything, all that he told you.[768] For we had come to the strong-established house of Peleus[769] assembling fighting all through generous Achaia. We came[770] there, and found the hero Menoitios inside, and you,[771] Achilleus beside you, and Peleus the aged horseman was burning[772] the fat thigh pieces of an ox to Zeus who delights in the thunder[773] in the garth of the courtyard. He was holding a golden beaker[774] and pouring the bright wine over the burning dedications. You two[775] were over the meat of the ox attending to it, and we came[776] and stood in the forecourt, and Achilleus sprang up wondering[777] and took us by the hand and led us in, and told us to sit down,[778] and set hospitality properly before us, as is the stranger’s[779] right. Now when we had taken our pleasure of eating and drinking[780] I began to talk, and invited you both to come with us,[781] and you were altogether willing, and your fathers spoke to you.[782] And Peleus the aged was telling his own son, Achilleus,[783] to be always best in battle and pre-eminent beyond all others,[784] but for you, Menoitios, Aktor’s son, had this to say to you:[785] ‘My child, by right of blood Achilleus is higher than you are,[786] but you are the elder. Yet in strength he is far the greater.[787] You must speak solid words to him, and give him good counsel,[788] and point his way. If he listens to you it will be for his own good.’[789] This is what the old man told you, you have forgotten. Yet even[790] now you might speak to wise Achilleus, he might be persuaded.  p 138  [791] Who knows if, with God helping, you might trouble his spirit[792] by entreaty, since the persuasion of a friend is a strong thing.[793] But if he is drawing back from some prophecy known in his own heart[794] and by Zeus’ will his honoured mother has told him of something,[795] let him send you out, at least, and the rest of the Myrmidon people[796] follow you, and you may be a light given to the Danaans.[797] And let him give you his splendid armour to wear to the fighting,[798] if perhaps the Trojans might think you are he, and give way[799] from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind[800] again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting[801] You, unwearied, might with a mere cry pile men wearied[802] back upon their city, and away from the ships and the shelters.”[803] So he spoke, and stirred the feeling in the breast of Patroklos,[804] and he went on the run along the ships to the son of Aiakos,[805] Achilleus. But as Patroklos came in his running to the ships[806] of great Odysseus, where the Achaians had their assembly and dealt out[807] rights, and where were established their altars to the immortals,[808] there Eurypylos, who had been wounded in the thigh with an arrow,[809] met him, the illustrious son of Euaimon, limping[810] away from the battle, and the watery sweat was running[811] down his shoulders and face, and from the sore wound dark blood[812] continued to drip, and yet the will stayed steady within him.[813] And the strong son of Menoitios looked on him in pity[814] and was sorrowful over him, and addressed him in winged words:[815] “Poor wretches, you leaders and men of counsel among the Danaans,[816] was it your fate then, far from your friends and the land of your fathers,[817] to glut with your shining fat the running dogs here in Troy land?[818] But tell me this, my lord Eurypylos grown under God’s hand:[819] will the Achaians somehow be able to hold huge Hektor[820] or must they now perish beaten down under his spear?”[821] Then Eurypylos who was wounded answered him in turn:[822] “No longer, illustrious Patroklos, can the Achaians[823] defend themselves, but they will be piled back into their black ships.[824] For all of these who were before the bravest in battle[825] are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds[826] under the hands of the Trojans whose strength is forever on the uprise.[827] But help save me now at least, leading me away to my black ship,[828] and cut the arrow out of my thigh, wash the dark blood running[829] out of it with warm water, and put kind medicines on it,[830] good ones, which they say you have been told of by Achilleus,[831] since Cheiron, most righteous of the Centaurs, told him about them.[832] As for Machaon and Podaleirios, who are healers,[833] I think Machaon has got a wound, and is in the shelters[834] lying there, and himself is in need of a blameless healer,[835] while the other in the plain is standing the bitter attack of the Trojans.”[836] Then in turn the strong son of Menoitios spoke to him:[837] “But how shall this be, my lord Eurypylos, how shall we do it?[838] I am on my way carrying a message to wise Achilleus[839] given me by Gerenian Nestor, the Achaian’s watcher.[840] But even so I will not leave you in your affliction.”[841] He spoke, and holding the shepherd of the host under the arms led him[842] to his shelter, and a henchman seeing them spread out some ox-hides,  p 139  [843] and Patroklos laid him there and with a knife cut the sharp tearing[844] arrow out of his thigh, and washed the black blood running from it[845] with warm water, and, pounding it up in his hands, laid on[846] a bitter root to make pain disappear, one which stayed[847] all kinds of pain. And the wound dried, and the flow of blood stopped.book twelve[1] So within the shelter the warlike son of Menoitios[2] tended stricken Eurypylos, and meanwhile the Argives[3] and the Trojans fought on in massed battle, nor was the Danaans’[4] ditch going to hold them back nor the wide wall above it[5] they had built for the sake of their ships, and driven a deep ditch[6] about it, and had not given to the gods grand sacrifices[7] so that it might guard their running ships and their masses[8] of spoil within it. It had been built in despite of the immortal[9] gods, and therefore it was not to stand firm for a long time.[10] So long as Hektor was still alive, and Achilleus was angry,[11] so long as the citadel of lord Priam was a city untaken,[12] for this time the great wall of the Achaians stood firm. But afterwards[13] when all the bravest among the Trojans had died in the fighting,[14] and many of the Argives had been beaten down, and some left,[15] when in the tenth year the city of Priam was taken[16] and the Argives gone in their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,[17] then at last Poseidon and Apollo took counsel[18] to wreck the wall, letting loose the strength of rivers upon it,[19] all the rivers that run to the sea from the mountains of Ida,[20] Rhesos and Heptaporos, Karesos and Rhodios,[21] Grenikos and Aisepos, and immortal Skamandros,[22] and Simoeis, where much ox-hide armour and helmets were tumbled[23] in the river mud, and many of the race of the half-god mortals.[24] Phoibos Apollo turned the mouths of these waters together[25] and nine days long threw the flood against the wall, and Zeus rained[26] incessantly, to break the wall faster and wash it seaward.[27] And the shaker of the earth himself holding in his hands the trident[28] guided them, and hurled into the waves all the bastions’ strengthening[29] of logs and stones the toiling Achaians had set in position[30] and made all smooth again by the hard-running passage of Helle[31] and once again piled the great beach under sand, having wrecked[32] the wall, and turned the rivers again to make their way down[33] the same channel where before they had run the bright stream of their water.[34] Thus, afterwards, Poseidon and Apollo were minded[35] to put things in place, but at this time battle and clamour were blazing[36] about the strong-founded wall and the bastion timbers were thundering[37] as they were struck, as the Argives broken under Zeus’ lashing[38] were crowded back on their hollow ships, and struggled to get clear[39] in dread of Hektor, the strong one who drove men to thoughts of panic.[40] But Hektor, as he had before, fought on like a whirlwind[41] As when among a pack of hounds and huntsmen assembled[42] a wild boar or lion turns at bay in the strength of his fury,[43] and the men, closing themselves into a wall about him,  p 140  [44] stand up to face him, and cast at him with the volleying spears thrown[45] from their hands, and in spite of this the proud heart feels not[46] terror, nor turns to run, and it is his own courage that kills him;[47] and again and again he turns on them trying to break the massed men[48] and wherever he charges the masses of men break away in front of him;[49] such was Hektor as he went through the battle and rallied his companions[50] and drove them on to cross over the ditch, but now the fast-footed[51] horses balked at the edge of the lip, and dared not cross, whinnying[52] loud, since the ditch in its great width frightened them from it,[53] being not easy for them to overleap, nor to walk through,[54] since along the whole length the jut of the overhangs stood[55] on both sides, and the surface of the floor was thickset with pointed[56] palisades, which the sons of the Achaians had paled there[57] dense and huge, so as to hold off the rage of attackers.[58] And a horse straining at the strong-wheeled chariot might not easily[59] enter there, but the dismounted were strong in their effort.[60] And now Poulydamas stood beside bold Hektor, and spoke to him:[61] “Hektor, and other lords of the Trojans and companions in battle,[62] we are senseless trying to drive our fast-footed horses over[63] this ditch. It is hard indeed to cross, and sharp stakes are planted[64] inside it, and across from these the wall of the Achaians.[65] There there is no way to get down, no way again to do battle[66] from horses, for the passage is narrow and I think they must be hurt there.[67] For now if Zeus who thunders on high in evil intention[68] toward these is destroying them utterly, sending aid to the Trojans,[69] this is the way I would wish it, may it happen immediately[70] that the Achaians be destroyed here forgotten and far from[71] Argos; but if they turn again and a backrush comes on us[72] out of the ships, and we are driven against the deep ditch,[73] then I think no longer could one man to carry a message[74] get clear to the city, once the Achaians have turned back upon us.[75] Come then, do as I say, let us all be persuaded; let us[76] tell our henchmen to check our horses here by the ditch, then[77] let ourselves, all of us dismounted and armed in our war gear,[78] follow Hektor in mass formation. As for the Achaians,[79] they will not hold, if the bonds of death are fastened upon them.”[80] So spoke Poulydamas, and this counsel of safety pleased Hektor.[81] And at once in all his armour he leapt to the ground from his chariot,[82] and the rest of the Trojans assembled, not mounted behind their horses,[83] but all sprang to the ground, when they saw brilliant Hektor had done it.[84] Then each man gave orders to his own charioteer[85] to check the horses in good order at the edge of the ditch,[86] and the fighters formed apart into groups, then closing together[87] into five well-ordered battalions followed their leaders.[88] They who went with Hektor and Poulydamas the blameless,[89] these were most numerous, and bravest, and beyond others furious[90] to smash the wall and fight their way among the hollow ships,[91] and Kebriones went with them as third man, while by the chariots[92] Hektor had left another man, not so good as Kebriones.[93] Paris led the next group with Alkathoös and Agenor,[94] and Helenos, with godlike Deïphobos, led the third group,[95] sons both of Priam, and Asios was with them as third man,  p 141  [96] Asios, son of Hyrtakos, whom his tall shining horses[97] had carried over from Arisbe and beside the river Selleëis.[98] The leader of the fourth group was the strong son of Anchises,[99] Aineias, and with him were the two sons of Antenor,[100] Archelochos and Akamas, both skilled in all fighting.[101] Sarpedon led the far-renowned companions in battle,[102] and had chosen to go with him Glaukos and warlike Asteropaios[103] since these seemed to him to be marked out as the bravest[104] of the rest, after himself, but among all he was pre-eminent.[105] Now when these had closed their wrought ox-hide shields together[106] they charged straight for the Danaans, eagerly, with no thought longer[107] of being held, but rather to hurl themselves on the black ships.[108] Then the rest of the Trojans and renowned companions in battle[109] were willing to follow the order of blameless Poulydamas. Only[110] Asios, Hyrtakos’ son, lord of men, was unwilling[111] to leave his horses there and a charioteer to attend them[112] but kept them with him, and so drove on at the fast-running vessels,[113] poor fool, who by the ships in the pride of his horses and chariot[114] was not destined to evade the evil spirits of destruction[115] nor ever to make his way back again to windy Ilion.[116] Before this the dark-named destiny had shrouded about him[117] through the spear of Idomeneus, proud son of Deukalion.[118] For he sent his horses to the left of the ships, where the Achaians[119] were streaming back from the level ground with horses and chariots,[120] and this way he drove his chariot and horses, and found there[121] the leaves not yet pushed home in the gates, nor the long door-bar,[122] but men were holding them wide apart, on the chance of rescuing[123] some one of their companions running for the ships from the battle.[124] Of a purpose he steered his horses straight there, and his men followed[125] screaming aloud, since they thought the Achaians no longer[126] would hold, but that they would be driven back on their dark ships.[127] Fools! since in the gates they found two men of the bravest,[128] high-hearted sons of the spear-fighting Lapithai, one[129] the son of Peirithoös, powerful Polypoites,[130] and one Leonteus, a man like the murderous god of battles.[131] Now these two, who had taken their place in front of the high gates,[132] stood there like two oaks who rear their crests in the mountains[133] and through day upon day stand up to the wind and the rainbeat[134] since their great roots reach far and are gripped in the ground. So[135] these two, in the confidence of their strength and their hands’ work,[136] stood up to tall Asios advancing upon them, nor gave way.[137] But these, holding up high the tanned leather of their shields, moved[138] straight in on the strong-built wall with enormous clamour[139] around Asios their lord and Iamenos and Orestes,[140] and Asios’ son Adamas, and Oinomaos and Thoön.[141] In this time the Lapithai still inside the wall were striving[142] to stir up the strong-greaved Achaians to defend the vessels,[143] but among the Danaans, when they saw the Trojans sweeping[144] on against the wall, a clamour arose, and they gave way;[145] and the two bursting through the gates fought on in front of them.[146] They were in the likeness of two wild boars who in the mountains[147] await a rabble of men and dogs advancing upon them  p 142  [148] and as they go tearing slantwise and rip the timber about them[149] to pieces at the stock, the grinding scream of their teeth sounds[150] high, until some man hits them with his throw and takes the life from them;[151] such was the grinding scream from the bright bronze covering their chests[152] struck hard on by spears, for they fought a very strong battle[153] in the confidence of their own strength and the people above them.[154] These flung about them with great stones torn from the strong-founded[155] bastions, as they fought in defence of themselves, and the shelters,[156] and the fast-running vessels, so that the flung stones dropped to the ground[157] like snowflakes which the winds’ blast whirling the shadowy clouds[158] drifts in their abundance along the prospering earth. So[159] the missiles flung from the hands of Achaians, and Trojans also,[160] went showering, and the helms and shields massive in the middle[161] crashed hollow underneath the impact of rocks like millstones.[162] And now Asios, Hyrtakos’ son, groaned aloud and beat on[163] both thighs with his hands, and spoke aloud in his agony:[164] “Zeus father, now even you are made utterly a lover[165] of deception. For I never thought the fighting Achaians[166] would be able to hold our strength and our hands invincible.[167] But they, as wasps quick-bending in the middle, or as bees[168] will make their homes at the side of the rocky way, and will not[169] abandon the hollow house they have made, but stand up to[170] men who come to destroy them, and fight for the sake of their children,[171] so these, though they are only two, are unwilling to give back[172] from the gates, until they have killed their men, or are taken.”[173] He spoke, but by such talk did not persuade the heart of Zeus[174] whose desire it was to extend the glory to Hektor.[175] And now at the various gates various men fought each other.[176] It were too much toil for me, as if I were a god, to tell all this,[177] for all about the stone wall the inhuman strength of the fire[178] was rising, and the Argives fought unhappily, yet they must fight[179] on, to defend their ships. And all the gods who were helpers[180] of the Danaans in the fighting were dejected in spirit.[181] But the Lapithai fought on and closed in the hateful fighting,[182] and there the son of Peirithoös, powerful Polypoites,[183] struck Damasos with the spear through the bronze-sided helmet,[184] and the brazen helmet could not hold, but the bronze spearhead[185] driven on through smashed the bone apart, and the inward[186] brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury.[187] Then he went on to kill Pylon and Ormenos. Meanwhile[188] Leonteus, the scion of Ares, struck down Antimachos’[189] son, Hippomachos, with a spear cast into the war belt[190] and afterwards drawing his sharp sword out of the scabbard[191] made a rush through the crowding men, and struck from close up[192] Antiphates first, so that he crashed on his back to the ground, then[193] beat down along the prospering earth Menon and Orestes[194] and Iamenos, all beaten down in rapid succession.[195] Now as these were stripping their men of the shining armour,[196] the fighting men following with Poulydamas and Hektor,[197] who were most numerous, and bravest, and beyond others furious[198] to smash the wall, and set fire to the vessels, these still[199] were divided in doubt as they stood there at the ditch’s edge.  p 143  [200] As they were urgent to cross a bird sign had appeared to them,[201] an eagle, flying high and holding to the left of the people[202] and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-coloured,[203] alive still and breathing, it had not forgotten its warcraft[204] yet, for writhing back it struck the eagle that held it[205] by chest and neck, so that the eagle let it drop groundward[206] in pain of the bite, and dashed it down in the midst of the battle[207] and itself, screaming high, winged away down the wind’s blast.[208] And the Trojans shivered with fear as they looked on the lithe snake[209] lying in their midst, a portent of Zeus of the aegis.[210] And now Poulydamas stood beside bold Hektor and spoke to him:[211] “Hektor, somehow in assembly you move ever against me[212] though I speak excellently, since indeed there is no good reason[213] for you, in your skill, to argue wrong, neither in the councils[214] nor in the fighting, and ever to be upholding your own cause.[215] Now once more I will speak out the way it seems best to me.[216] Let us not go on and fight the Danaans by their ships. I think[217] it will end as the portent was accomplished, if the bird sign[218] that came to the Trojans as we were trying to cross was a true one,[219] an eagle, flying high and holding to the left of the people[220] and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-coloured,[221] alive, but let it drop suddenly before winning his own home,[222] and could not finish carrying it back to give to his children.[223] So we, even though in our great strength we break in the gates[224] and the wall of the Achaians, and the Achaians give way before us,[225] we shall not take the same ways back from the ships in good order;[226] since we shall leave many Trojans behind us, whom the Achaians[227] will cut down with the bronze as they fight for themselves by their vessels.[228] So an interpreter of the gods would answer, one who knew[229] in his mind the truth of portents, and whom the people believed in.”[230] Looking darkly at him tall Hektor of the shining helm answered:[231] “Poulydamas, these things that you argue please me longer.[232] Your mind knows how to contrive a saying better than this one.[233] But if in all seriousness this is your true argument, then[234] it is the very gods who ruined the brain within you,[235] you who are telling me to forget the counsels of thunderous[236] Zeus, in which he himself nodded his head to me and assented.[237] But you: you tell me to put my trust in birds, who spread[238] wide their wings. I care nothing for these, I think nothing of them,[239] nor whether they go by on our right against dawn and sunrise[240] or go by to the left against the glooming mist and the darkness.[241] No, let us put our trust in the counsel of great Zeus, he who[242] is lord over all mortal men and all the immortals.[243] One bird sign is best: to fight in defence of our country.[244] Why are you so afraid of war and hostility? Even[245] though all the rest of us were to be cut down around you[246] among the Argive ships, you would run no danger of dying[247] since your heart is not enduring in battle nor a fighter’s.[248] But if you shrink away from the murderous work, or turn back[249] some other man from the fighting, beguiling him with your arguments,[250] at once beaten down under my spear you will lose your own life.”[251] He spoke, and led the way, and the rest of them came on after him  p 144  [252] with unearthly clamour, and over them Zeus who delights in the thunder[253] drove down from among the hills of Ida the blast of a windstorm[254] which swept the dust straight against the ships. He was mazing the minds[255] of the Achaians, and giving glory to the Trojans and Hektor,[256] and they in the confidence of the portents shown, and their own strength,[257] worked to break down the great wall of Achaians. They tore[258] at the projections on the outworks, and broke down the battlements[259] and shook with levers the jut of the buttresses the Achaians[260] had stuck in the earth on the outer face to shore their defences.[261] They tore at these, in hope of breaking down the Achaians’[262] wall, but now the Danaans did not give way in front of them,[263] but they, fencing the battlements with the hides of oxen,[264] hurled from the wall at the enemy who came on beneath it.[265] The two Aiantes, walking up and down the length of the ramparts,[266] urged the men on, stirring up the warcraft of the Achaians,[267] and stung them along, using kind words to one, to another[268] hard ones, whenever they saw a man hang back from the fighting:[269] “Dear friends, you who are pre-eminent among the Argives, you who[270] are of middle estate, you who are of low account, since[271] all of us are not alike in battle, this is work for all now,[272] and you yourselves can see it. Now let no man let himself[273] be turned back upon the ships for the sound of their blustering[274] but keep forever forward calling out courage to each other.[275] So may Olympian Zeus who grips the thunderbolt grant us[276] a way to the city, when we beat off the attack of our enemies.”[277] Such was their far cry, and they stirred the Achaians’ war strength.[278] And they, as storms of snow descend to the ground incessant[279] on a winter day, when Zeus of the counsels, showing[280] before men what shafts he possesses, brings on a snowstorm[281] and stills the winds asleep in the solid drift, enshrouding[282] the peaks that tower among the mountains and the shoulders out-jutting,[283] and the low lands with their grasses, and the prospering work of men’s hands,[284] and the drift falls along the grey sea, the harbours and beaches,[285] and the surf that breaks against it is stilled, all the things elsewhere[286] it shrouds from above, with the burden of Zeus’ rain heavy upon it;[287] so numerous and incessant were the stones volleyed from both sides,[288] some thrown on Trojans, others flung against the Achaians[289] by Trojans, so the whole length of the wall thundered beneath them.[290] And not even then might the Trojans and glorious Hektor[291] have broken in the gates of the rampart, and the long door-bar,[292] had not Zeus of the counsels driven his own son, Sarpedon,[293] upon the Argives, like a lion among horn-curved cattle.[294] Presently he held before him the perfect circle of his shield,[295] a lovely thing of beaten bronze, which the bronze-smith hammered[296] out for him, and on the inward side had stitched ox-hides[297] in close folds with golden staples clean round the circle.[298] Holding this shield in front of him, and shaking two spears,[299] he went onward like some hill-kept lion, who for a long time[300] has gone lacking meat, and the proud heart is urgent upon him[301] to get inside of a close steading and go for the sheepflocks.[302] And even though he finds herdsmen in that place, who are watching  p 145  [303] about their sheepflocks, armed with spears, and with dogs, even so[304] he has no thought of being driven from the steading without some attack made,[305] and either makes his spring and seizes a sheep, or else[306] himself is hit in the first attack by a spear from a swift hand[307] thrown. So now his spirit drove on godlike Sarpedon[308] to make a rush at the wall and break apart the battlements.[309] And now he spoke in address to Glaukos, son of Hippolochos:[310] “Glaukos, why is it you and I are honoured before others[311] with pride of place, the choice meats and the filled wine cups[312] in Lykia, and all men look on us as if we were immortals,[313] and we are appointed a great piece of land by the banks of Xanthos,[314] good land, orchard and vineyard, and ploughland for the planting of wheat?[315] Therefore it is our duty in the forefront of the Lykians[316] to take our stand, and bear our part of the blazing of battle,[317] so that a man of the close-armoured Lykians may say of us:[318] ‘Indeed, these are no ignoble men who are lords of Lykia,[319] these kings of ours, who feed upon the fat sheep appointed[320] and drink the exquisite sweet wine, since indeed there is strength[321] of valour in them, since they fight in the forefront of the Lykians.’[322] Man, supposing you and I, escaping this battle,[323] would be able to live on forever, ageless, immortal,[324] so neither would I myself go on fighting in the foremost[325] nor would I urge you into the fighting where men win glory.[326] But now, seeing that the spirits of death stand close about us[327] in their thousands, no man can turn aside nor escape them,[328] let us go on and win glory for ourselves, or yield it to others.”[329] He spoke, nor did Glaukos disobey him nor turn aside from him.[330] They, leading the great horde of the Lykians, advanced straight onward,[331] and the son of Peteos, Menestheus, shivered as he saw them[332] since they came against his bastion and carried disaster upon it.[333] He scanned the rampart of the Achaians in the hope of seeing[334] some great chief who could beat back the bane from his company,[335] and saw the two Aiantes, insatiate of battle, standing[336] on the wall, and Teukros even now coming up from the shelter,[337] and close by but he was not able to cry out and make them[338] hear, so great was the clamour about him as the shouts hit skyward,[339] as shields were battered with missiles, and the helmets crested with horse-hair,[340] and the gates, which all had been slammed shut, and the Trojans standing[341] against them were trying to break them down and force their way in.[342] At once he sent Thootes off as a runner to Aias:[343] “Go on the run, brilliant Thootes, and call Aias here,[344] or better, both Aiantes, since that would be far the best thing[345] that could happen, since here headlong destruction is building against us.[346] Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon us, who even[347] before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.[348] But if in their place also hard work and fury have arisen,[349] at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself,[350] and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow’s use.”[351] He spoke, nor did the herald disobey when he heard him,[352] but went on the run along the wall of the bronze-armoured Achaians  p 146  [353] and came and stood by the two Aiantes, and spoke to them straight out:[354] “Aiantes, leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives: Menestheus,[355] beloved son of Peteos engendered of Zeus, desires you[356] to go where he is and meet the danger, if only for a little;[357] both of you for choice, since that would be far the best thing[358] that could happen, since there headlong destruction is building against him.[359] Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon him, who even[360] before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.[361] But if in this place also hard fighting and fury have arisen,[362] at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself[363] and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow’s use.”[364] He spoke, and huge Telamonian Aias did not disobey him,[365] but at once called out in winged words to Aias, the son of Oïleus:[366] “Aias, now you two, yourself and strong Lykomedes,[367] must stand your ground and urge on the Danaans to fight strongly.[368] I am going over there to meet the attack, and afterwards[369] I will come back soon, when I have beaten them back from the others.”[370] So speaking Telamonian Aias went away, and with him[371] went Teukros, his brother by the same father, and following them[372] was Pandion, who carried the curved bow for Teukros.[373] They kept inside the wall as they went, till they came to the bastion[374] of high-hearted Menestheus, and found men who were hard pressed there,[375] for the strong lords and men of counsel among the Lykians[376] came on against the battlements like a darkening stormwind,[377] and they charged forward to fight with these, and the clamour rose high.[378] First to kill his man was Telamonian Aias.[379] It was Sarpedon’s companion in arms, high-hearted Epikles,[380] whom he struck with a great jagged stone, that lay at the inside[381] of the wall, huge, on top of the battlements. A man could not easily[382] hold it, not even if he were very strong, in both hands,[383] of men such as men are now but he heaving it high threw it,[384] and smashed in the four-sheeted helm, and pounded to pieces[385] the bones of the head inside it, so that Epikles dropped[386] like a diver from the high bastion, and the life left his bones.[387] And Teukros with an arrow struck the strong son of Hippolochos,[388] Glaukos, as he was swarming aloft the wall’s high bastion,[389] where he saw the arm was bare of defence, and stayed his warcraft;[390] he sprang down from the wall, secretly, for fear some Achaian[391] might see that he had been hit and vaunt with high words over him.[392] Sarpedon, as soon as he was aware that Glaukos had gone back,[393] was downcast, nevertheless he did not forget his warcraft[394] but striking with his spear at Alkmaon, the son of Thestor,[395] stabbed him, then wrenched the spear out, and he following the spear fell[396] on his face, and the armour elaborate with bronze clashed about him.[397] And Sarpedon, grabbing in both ponderous hands the battlements,[398] pulled, and the whole thing came away in his hands, and the rampart[399] was stripped defenceless above. He had opened a pathway for many.[400] Aias and Teukros aimed at him together, and Teukros[401] hit him with an arrow in the shining belt that encircled[402] his chest to hold the man-covering shield, but Zeus brushed the death spirits[403] from his son, and would not let him be killed there beside the ships’ sterns;[404] and Aias plunging upon him stabbed at the shield, but the spearhead  p 147  [405] did not pass clean through. Still, he pounded him back in his fury[406] so that he gave back a little space from the battlement, and yet not[407] utterly gave way, since his heart was still hopeful of winning glory.[408] He whirled about and called aloud to the godlike Lykians:[409] “Lykians, why do you thus let go of your furious valour?[410] It is a hard thing for me, strong as I am, to break down[411] the wall, single-handed, and open a path to the vessels.[412] Come on with me then. This work is better if many do it.”[413] So he spoke, and they, awed at the reproach of their leader,[414] put on the pressure of more weight around their lord of the counsels.[415] And on the other side the Argives stiffened their battalions[416] inside the wall, and a huge fight developed between the two sides.[417] For neither could the powerful Lykians break in the rampart[418] of the Danaans, and so open a path through to the vessels,[419] nor had the Danaan spearmen strength to push back the Lykians[420] from the rampart, once they had won to a place close under it;[421] but as two men with measuring ropes in their hands fight bitterly[422] about a boundary line at the meeting place of two cornfields,[423] and the two of them fight in the strait place over the rights of division,[424] so the battlements held these armies apart, and across them[425] they hewed at each other, and at the ox-hide shields strong-circled[426] guarding men’s chests, and at the fluttering straps of the guard-skins.[427] Many were torn in their white flesh by the bronze without pity[428] wherever one of the fighters turning aside laid bare[429] his back, and many were struck with the spear carried clean through the shield[430] Everywhere the battlements and the bastions were awash[431] with men’s blood shed from both sides, Achaian and Trojan.[432] But even so they could not drive panic among the Achaians,[433] but held evenly as the scales which a careful widow[434] holds, taking it by the balance beam, and weighs her wool evenly[435] at either end, working to win a pitiful wage for her children:[436] so the battles fought by both sides were pulled fast and even[437] until that time when Zeus gave the greater glory to Hektor,[438] Priam’s son, who was first to break into the wall of the Achaians.[439] For he lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Trojans:[440] “Rise up, Trojans, breakers of horses, and wreck the ramparts[441] of the Argives, and let loose the inhuman fire on their vessels.”[442] So he spoke, driving them on, and they all gave ear to him[443] and steered against the wall in a pack, and at once gripping[444] still their edged spears caught and swarmed up the wall’s projections.[445] Meanwhile Hektor snatched up a stone that stood before the gates[446] and carried it along; it was blunt-massed at the base, but the upper[447] end was sharp; two men, the best in all a community,[448] could not easily hoist it up from the ground to a wagon,[449] of men such as men are now, but he alone lifted and shook it[450] as the son of devious-devising Kronos made it light for him.[451] As when a shepherd easily carries the fleece of a wether,[452] picking it up with one hand, and little is the burden weighting him,[453] so Hektor lifting the stone carried it straight for the door leaves[454] which filled the gateway ponderously close-fitted together.[455] These were high and twofold, and double door-bars on the inside  p 148  [456] overlapping each other closed it, and a single pin-bolt secures them.[457] He came and stood very close and taking a strong wide stance threw[458] at the middle, leaning into the throw, that the cast might not lack[459] force, and smashed the hinges at either side, and the stone crashed[460] ponderously in, and the gates groaned deep, and the door-bars[461] could not hold, but the leaves were smashed to a wreckage of splinters[462] under the stone’s impact. Then glorious Hektor burst in[463] with dark face like sudden night, but he shone with the ghastly[464] glitter of bronze that girded his skin, and carried two spears[465] in his hands. No one could have stood up against him, and stopped him,[466] except the gods, when he burst in the gates; and his eyes flashed fire.[467] Whirling, he called out across the battle to the Trojans[468] to climb over the wall, and they obeyed his urgency.[469] Immediately some swarmed over the wall, while others swept in[470] through the wrought gateways, and the Danaans scattered in terror[471] among their hollow ships, and clamour incessant rose up.book thirteen[1] When Zeus had driven against the ships the Trojans and Hektor,[2] he left them beside these to endure the hard work and sorrow[3] of fighting without respite, and himself turned his eyes shining[4] far away, looking out over the land of the Thracian riders[5] and the Mysians who fight at close quarters, and the proud Hippomolgoi,[6] drinkers of milk, and the Abioi, most righteous of all men.[7] He did not at all now turn his shining eyes upon Troy land[8] for he had no idea in mind that any one of the immortals[9] would come down to stand by either Danaans or Trojans.[10] Neither did the powerful shaker of the earth keep blind watch;[11] for he sat and admired the fighting and the run of the battle,[12] aloft on top of the highest summit of timbered Samos,[13] the Thracian place; and from there all Ida appeared before him,[14] and the city of Priam was plain to see, and the ships of the Achaians.[15] There he came up out of the water, and sat, and pitied the Achaians[16] who were beaten by the Trojans, and blamed Zeus for it in bitterness.[17] So presently he came down from the craggy mountain, striding[18] on rapid feet, and the tall mountains trembled and the timber[19] under the immortal feet of Poseidon’s progress.[20] He took three long strides forward, and in the fourth came to his goal,[21] Aigai, where his glorious house was built in the waters’[22] depth, glittering with gold, imperishable forever.[23] Going there he harnessed under his chariot his bronze-shod horses,[24] flying-footed, with long manes streaming of gold; and he put on[25] clothing of gold about his own body, and took up the golden[26] lash, carefully compacted, and climbed up into his chariot[27] and drove it across the waves. And about him the sea beasts came up[28] from their deep places and played in his path, and acknowledged their master,[29] and the sea stood apart before him, rejoicing. The horses winged on[30] delicately, and the bronze axle beneath was not wetted.[31] The fast-running horses carried him to the ships of the Achaians.  p 149  [32] There is a cave, broad and deep down in the gloom of the water,[33] lying midway between Tenedos and Imbros of the high cliffs.[34] There Poseidon the shaker of the earth reined in his horses,[35] and slipped them from the yoke, and threw fodder immortal before them[36] so they could eat, and threw around their feet golden hobbles[37] not to be broken or slipped from, so they would wait there steadfast[38] for their lord gone. And Poseidon went to the ships of the Achaians.[39] But the Trojans, gathered into a pack, like flame, like a stormcloud,[40] came on after Hektor the son of Priam, raging relentless,[41] roaring and crying as one, and their hopes ran high of capturing[42] the ships of the Achaians, and killing the best men beside them,[43] all of them. But Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it[44] rose up out of the deep water to stir on the Argives,[45] likening himself in form and weariless voice to Kalchas.[46] First he spoke to the Aiantes, who were burning for battle already:[47] “Aiantes, you two, remembering the spirit of warcraft[48] and not that of shivering panic, must save the Achaian people.[49] Elsewhere in truth I do not fear the Trojans’ invincible[50] hands, though in full force they have swarmed over our great wall;[51] since the strong-greaved Achaians will be able to hold the rest of them.[52] But I fear most terribly disaster to us in the one place[53] where that berserk flamelike leads them against us, Hektor,[54] who claims he must be son of Zeus of the high strength. May this[55] be the message some one of the gods gives your minds to carry,[56] that you stand fast strongly yourselves, urge the rest to stand also.[57] Thus, hard though he sweeps on, you might stay him beside the fast-running[58] ships, even though the very Olympian wakes him to battle.”[59] Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it spoke, and striking[60] both of them with his staff filled them with powerful valour,[61] and he made their limbs light, and their feet, and their hands above them,[62] and burst into winged flight himself, like a hawk with quick wings[63] who from the huge height of an impassable rock lifting[64] leans to flight to pursue some other bird over the wide land;[65] so Poseidon shaker of the earth broke away from the Aiantes.[66] And of the two swift Aias son of Oïleus was first[67] to know him, and spoke therewith to Aias the son of Telamon;[68] “Aias, since some one of the gods, whose hold is Olympos,[69] has likened himself to the seer, and told us to fight by our vessels,[70] this is not Kalchas, the bird interpreter of the gods, for I knew[71] easily as he went away the form of his feet, the legs’ form[72] from behind him. Gods, though gods, are conspicuous. Therefore[73] as for me, the spirit inside my inward breast drives me[74] all the harder to carry on the war and the fighting,[75] and my feet underneath me are eager and my hands above them.”[76] Aias the son of Telamon spoke to him in answer:[77] “So for me also now the invincible hands on my spearshaft[78] are furious, my strength is rising, and both feet beneath me[79] are sweeping me onward, so that I long even for single combat[80] with Hektor, Priam’s son, the forever avid of battle.”[81] Now as these two were saying such things to each other, joyful[82] in the delight of battle the god had put into their spirits,  p 150  [83] meanwhile the earth-encircler stirred up the Achaians behind them[84] who were cooling the heat of the inward heart back beside their vessels,[85] for their very limbs were broken with weariness of hard work, and also[86] discouragement of the heart came over them, as they watched[87] the Trojans, and how in a mass they had overswarmed the great wall.[88] As they saw them the tears dripped from their eyes; they did not[89] think they could win clear of the evil, but the earth-shaker[90] lightly turning their battalions to strength drove them onward.[91] He came first in encouragement to Teukros and Leïtos,[92] with the fighting Peneleos, and Deïpyros and Thoas,[93] to Meriones and Antilochos, both urgent for battle.[94] Calling out to these in winged words he rallied them onward:[95] “Shame, you Argives, young fighting men, since I for my part[96] have confidence that by fighting you can save our ships from destruction;[97] but if you yourselves are to go slack from the sorrowful fighting[98] now is seen your day to be beaten down by the Trojans.[99] Oh for shame! Here is a great strange thing I see with my own eyes,[100] a terrible thing, and one that I thought never could happen,[101] that the Trojans could come against our ships, they who in time past[102] were like fugitive deer before us, who in the forests[103] are spoil for scavengers and wolves and leopards, who scatter[104] in absolute cowardice, there is no war spirit within them.[105] So before now the Trojans were unwilling to stand up[106] against the strength and hands of the Achaians, even for a little,[107] but now far from their city they fight by the hollow vessels[108] through the weakness of our leader, and the hanging back of our people[109] who have made their quarrel with him, and will not stand in defence[110] of the fast-running ships. Instead of this they are killed against them.[111] Yet even though it be utterly true that the son of Atreus[112] the hero wide-powerful Agamemnon is guilty[113] because he did dishonour to Peleus’ son, the swift-footed,[114] still there is no way for us now to hang back from the fighting.[115] No, sooner let us heal it, for the hearts of great men can be healed.[116] But you can no longer in honour give way from your fighting valour[117] being all the best men along the host. Even I, for my part,[118] would not quarrel with any man who hung back from the fighting[119] because he was a weak thing, but with you my heart must be angry.[120] O friends, soon you will bring to pass some still greater evil[121] with his hanging back. Let every one of you plant in his heart’s depth[122] discipline and shamefastness. A big battle rises against you.[123] For Hektor of the great war cry is fighting beside our vessels[124] in his power, and has broken our gates and the long door-bar.”[125] So urging them on the earth-encircler stirred up the Achaians,[126] and their battalions formed in strength about the two Aiantes,[127] battalions the war god could not find fault with, coming among them,[128] nor Athene lady of storming armies, since there the bravest[129] formed apart and stood against the Trojans and brilliant Hektor[130] locking spear by spear, shield against shield at the base, so buckler[131] leaned on buckler, helmet on helmet, man against man,[132] and the horse-hair crests along the horns of their shining helmets[133] touched as they bent their heads, so dense were they formed on each other,[134] and the spears shaken from their daring hands made a jagged battle line.[135] Their thoughts were driving straight ahead in the fury of fighting.  p 151  [136] The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them[137] raging straight forward, like a great rolling stone from a rock face[138] that a river swollen with winter rain has wrenched from its socket[139] and with immense washing broken the hold of the unwilling rock face;[140] the springing boulder flies on, and the forest thunders beneath it;[141] and the stone runs unwavering on a strong course, till it reaches[142] the flat land, then rolls no longer for all its onrush;[143] so Hektor for a while threatened lightly to break through[144] the shelters and ships of the Achaians and reach the water[145] cutting his way. But when he collided with the dense battalions[146] he was stopped, hard, beaten in on himself. The sons of the Achaians[147] against him stabbing at him with swords and the leaf-headed spears[148] thrust him away from them so that he gave ground backward, staggering.[149] He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Trojans:[150] “Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[151] stand with me. The Achaians will not hold me back for a long time[152] for all they are building themselves into a bastion against me.[153] No, I think they will give back under my spear, if truly[154] I am driven by the greatest of gods, the thunderous lord of Hera.”[155] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[156] Among them Deïphobos in high purpose had come striding,[157] Priam’s son, who held the perfect circle of his shield before him,[158] moving lightly on his feet as he walked in the shield’s protection.[159] Meriones aimed at him with the shining spear, and threw it[160] nor missed his mark, but struck the shield on its perfect circle[161] of bull’s hide, but the spear did not get through, but sooner[162] the long shaft was broken behind the head. Deïphobos[163] held the bull’s-hide shield away from him, his heart frightened[164] by the spear of wise Meriones, but that hero drew back[165] into the host of his own companions, deeply angered[166] for two things, the broken spear and the loss of his battle,[167] and went away back to the shelters and ships of the Achaians[168] to bring back a long spear that was left behind in his shelter.[169] But the rest fought with clamour incessant rising about them.[170] Teukros, son of Telamon, was the first to kill his man, Imbrios[171] the spearfighter, son of Mentor of the many horses, one who[172] before the coming of the sons of the Achaians lived in Pedaios[173] and had married a bastard daughter of Priam, Medesikaste.[174] But when the oarswept ships of the Danaans came, he went back[175] to Ilion, and was a great man among the Trojans, and lived[176] at Priam’s side, who honoured him as he did his own children.[177] Now the son of Telamon with the long spear stabbed him under[178] the ear, and wrenched the spear out again, and he dropped like an ash tree[179] which, on the crest of a mountain glittering far about, cut down[180] with the bronze axe scatters on the ground its delicate leafage;[181] so he dropped, and the armour elaborate with bronze clashed[182] about him, and Teukros ran up, eager to strip the armour.[183] As he came on Hektor threw at him with the shining javelin,[184] but Teukros with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear[185] by a little, and Hektor struck Amphimachos, son of Aktorian[186] Kteatos, with a spear in his chest as he swept into battle.[187] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.[188] Then Hektor charged in to tear the helm of great-hearted Amphimachos  p 152  [189] from his head where it fitted close on the brows, but Aias[190] thrust with the shining spear at Hektor as he came onward;[191] he could not manage to reach the skin, since this was all shrouded[192] in the ghastly bronze, but drove at the shield’s mass in the middle[193] and beat him back in great strength so that Hektor gave ground backward[194] from both corpses. These the Achaians dragged out of the fighting.[195] Then Stichios and brilliant Menestheus, lords of the Athenians,[196] carried Amphimachos back among the Achaian people.[197] But the two Aiantes in the fury of their fierce war strength,[198] as two lions catch up a goat from the guard of rip-fanged[199] hounds, and carry it into the density of the underbrush,[200] holding it high from the ground in the crook of their jaws, so the lordly[201] two Aiantes lifted Imbrios high and stripped him[202] of his armour, and the son of Oïleus, in anger[203] for Amphimachos, hewed away his head from the soft neck[204] and threw it spinning like a ball through the throng of fighters[205] until it came to rest in the dust at the feet of Hektor.[206] Then Poseidon was angered about the heart at his grandson’s[207] slaying in the bitter hostility, so the god went forth[208] on his way among the shelters and ships of the Achaians[209] and stirred the Danaans, and worked disaster against the Trojans.[210] Idomeneus the spear-famed encountered him, on his way[211] from a companion, who had just before come back from the fighting[212] wounded in the hollow behind the knee by the sharp bronze.[213] This man his companions carried away. Idomeneus had given[214] the healers instructions and gone on to his shelter, still burning[215] to face the battle, and now the strong earth-shaker spoke to him.[216] Poseidon likened his voice to Thoas, son of Andraimon,[217] lord of the Aitolians over all Pleuron, and headlong[218] Kalydon, who was honoured in his countryside as a god is:[219] “Idomeneus, lord of the Kretans’ councils, where are those threats you gave[220] now, that the sons of the Achaians uttered against the Trojans?”[221] Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:[222] “Thoas, no man is responsible for this, so far as[223] my thought goes, since all of us understand how to wage war.[224] It is not that heartless fear holds anyone, that a man yielding[225] to dread emerges out of the evil fighting, but rather[226] this way must be pleasurable to Kronos’ son in his great strength,[227] that the Achaians must die here forgotten, and far from Argos.[228] Since you, Thoas, have been before this a man stubborn in battle[229] and stirred up another whenever you saw one hang back, so now[230] also do not give up, and urge on each man as you find him.”[231] Then in answer spoke the shaker of the earth, Poseidon:[232] “Idomeneus, may that man who this day wilfully hangs back[233] from the fighting never win home again out of Troy land,[234] but stay here and be made dogs’ delight for their feasting. Come then,[235] take up your armour and go with me. We must speed this action[236] together, since we, being two, might bring some advantage.[237] The warcraft even of sad fighters combined turns courage,[238] and you and I would have skill to fight even against good men.”[239] So he spoke and strode on, a god, through the mortal’s struggle.[240] Idomeneus, when he came back to his strong-built shelter,  p 153  [241] drew his splendid armour over his body, and caught up two spears,[242] and went on his way, as a thunderbolt, which the son of Kronos[243] catching up in his hand shakes from the shining edge of Olympos,[244] flashes as a portent to men and the bright glints shine from it.[245] Such was the glitter of bronze that girt his chest in his running.[246] Close to his shelter there encountered him his strong henchman,[247] Meriones, who was on his way to pick up a bronze spear[248] and bring it back. Idomeneus in his strength spoke to him:[249] “Meriones, son of Molos, swift-footed, dearest beloved[250] companion, why have you come back and left the battle and fighting?[251] Have you been hit somewhere? Does pain of a spear’s head afflict you?[252] Have you come back with someone’s message for me? For my part[253] my desire is to fight, not sit away in the shelters.”[254] Meriones, a thoughtful man, spoke to him in answer:[255] “Idomeneus, lord of the counsels of the bronze-armoured Kretans,[256] I am on my way to bring back a spear, if you have any[257] left in your shelter. I broke just now the one I was carrying[258] with a throw made against the shield of haughty Deïphobos.”[259] Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:[260] “You will find one spear, and twenty spears, if you want them,[261] standing against the shining inward wall in my shelter,[262] Trojan spears I win from men that I kill, for my way[263] is not to fight my battles standing far away from my enemies.[264] Thereby I have spears there, and shields massive in the middle,[265] and helms and corselets are there in all the pride of their shining.”[266] Meriones, a thoughtful man, spoke to him in answer:[267] “For me also, beside my shelter and beside my black ship,[268] there are many spoils of the Trojans, but not near for me to get them.[269] For I tell you, neither am I one who has forgotten his war strength[270] but among the foremost, along the fighting where men win glory,[271] I take my stand, whenever the quarrel of battle arises.[272] Let my fighting be forgotten by some other bronze-armoured[273] Achaian. You are the very one I think must know of it.”[274] Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:[275] “I know your valour and what you are. Why need you speak of it?[276] If now beside the ships all the best of us were to assemble[277] for a hidden position, and there man’s courage is best decided,[278] where the man who is a coward and the brave man show themselves clearly:[279] the skin of the coward changes colour one way and another,[280] and the heart inside him has no control to make him sit steady,[281] but he shifts his weight from one foot to another, then settles firmly[282] on both feet, and the heart inside his chest pounds violent[283] as he thinks of the death spirits, and his teeth chatter together:[284] but the brave man’s skin will not change colour, nor is he too much[285] frightened, once he has taken his place in the hidden position,[286] but his prayer is to close as soon as may be in bitter division:[287] and there no man could make light of your battle strength or your hand’s work.[288] Even were you to be wounded in your work with spearcast or spearstroke,[289] the weapon would not strike behind your neck, nor in your back,[290] but would be driven straight against the chest or the belly[291] as you made your way onward through the meeting of champions.  p 154  [292] But come, let us no longer stand here talking of these things[293] like children, for fear some man may arrogantly scold us.[294] Go to my shelter and choose for yourself a heavy spear.”[295] So he spoke; Meriones, a match for the rapid war god,[296] went into the shelter rapidly, and took up a bronze spear,[297] and with his mind deeply set on battle followed Idomeneus.[298] As manslaughtering Ares is when he strides into battle[299] and Terror goes on beside him, his beloved son, the powerful[300] and dauntless, who frightens even the patient-hearted warrior:[301] these two come out of Thrace to encounter in arms the Ephyroi[302] or the great-hearted Phlegyes, but the two will not listen to prayers[303] from both sides, but give the glory to one side or the other:[304] such were Meriones and Idomeneus, leaders of armies,[305] as they went on into the fighting helmed in the bright bronze.[306] First of the two, Meriones, spoke his word to Idomeneus:[307] “Deukalides, where are you minded to enter the battle?[308] Would it be on the right of the whole array, or in the centre,[309] or to the left? Since I think that nowhere else in the fighting[310] are the flowing-haired Achaians overmatched so badly.”[311] Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:[312] “There are others beside us to defend the ships in the centre,[313] the two Aiantes, and Teukros, best of all the Achaians[314] in archery, and a good man in the close of standing combat.[315] They can give Hektor, Priam’s son, enough hard hitting,[316] even though he is very strong, and sweeps hard into battle.[317] Furious though he is for fighting, it will be very steep work[318] for him to win through their irresistible hands and their war strength[319] and fire the ships, unless the son of Kronos in person[320] should hurl the blazing firebrand into our fast-running vessels.[321] Nor would huge Telamonian Aias give way to any man,[322] one who was mortal and ate bread, the yield of Demeter,[323] one who could be broken by the bronze and great stones flung at him.[324] He would not make way for Achilleus who breaks men in battle,[325] in close combat. For speed of feet none can strive with Achilleus.[326] Hold, as you say, for the left of the army, and thus soonest[327] shall we see whether we win glory or give it to others.”[328] He spoke, and Meriones, a match for the running war god,[329] led the way, till they came to the place in the army he spoke for.[330] These, as they saw Idomeneus like a flame in his valour[331] himself and his henchman with him in their elaborate war gear,[332] they called out across the battle and gathered about him,[333] and an indiscriminate fight rose up by the sterns of the vessels.[334] And as when under the screaming winds the whirlstorms bluster[335] on that day when the dust lies deepest along the pathways[336] and the winds in the confusion of dust uplift a great cloud,[337] such was their indiscriminate battle, and their hearts were furious[338] to slaughter each other with the sharp bronze through the press of the fighting.[339] The battle where men perish shuddered now with the long[340] man-tearing spears they held in their hands, their eyes were blinded[341] in the dazzle of the bronze light from the glittering helmets,[342] from the burnished corselets and the shining shields as men came on  p 155  [343] in confusion. That man would have to be very bold-hearted[344] who could be cheerful and not stricken looking on that struggle.[345] Two powerful sons of Kronos, hearts divided against each other,[346] were wreaking bitter agonies on the fighting warriors,[347] since Zeus willed the victory for the Trojans and Hektor,[348] glorifying swift-footed Achilleus, yet not utterly[349] did he wish the Achaian people to be destroyed before Ilion,[350] but only was giving glory to Thetis and her strong-spirited[351] son, while Poseidon emerging unseen from the grey salt water[352] went among the Argives and stirred them, since he was angered[353] that they were beaten by the Trojans and blamed Zeus for it bitterly.[354] Indeed, the two were of one generation and a single father,[355] but Zeus was the elder born and knew more. Therefore Poseidon[356] shrank from openly defending them, but secretly[357] in a man’s likeness was forever stirring them up through the army.[358] So these two had looped over both sides a crossing[359] cable of strong discord and the closing of battle, not to be[360] slipped, not to be broken, which unstrung the knees of many.[361] There Idomeneus, greying though he was, called on the Danaans[362] and charged in upon the Trojans and drove panic among them[363] for he killed Othryoneus, a man who had lived in Kabesos,[364] who was newly come in the wake of the rumour of war, and had asked[365] Priam for the hand of the loveliest of his daughters,[366] Kassandra, without bride price, but had promised a great work for her,[367] to drive back the unwilling sons of the Achaians from Troy land,[368] and aged Priam had bent his head in assent, and promised[369] to give her, so Othryoneus fought in the faith of his promises.[370] Idomeneus aimed at him with the shining spear, and threw it,[371] and hit him as he came onward with high stride, and the corselet[372] of bronze he wore could not hold, the spear fixed in the middle belly.[373] He fell, thunderously, and Idomeneus vaunting cried out:[374] “Othryoneus, I congratulate you beyond all others[375] if it is here that you will bring to pass what you promised[376] to Dardanian Priam, who in turn promised you his daughter.[377] See now, we also would make you a promise, and we would fulfil it;[378] we would give you the loveliest of Atreides’ daughters,[379] and bring her here from Argos to be your wife, if you joined us[380] and helped us storm the strong-founded city of Ilion.[381] Come then with me, so we can meet by our seafaring vessels[382] about a marriage; we here are not bad matchmakers for you.”[383] The hero Idomeneus spoke and dragged him through the strong encounter[384] caught by the foot, but now Asios came to stand by him[385] dismounted, ahead of his horses whom his henchman held ever behind him[386] so that they breathed on his shoulders. He was striving in all his fury[387] to strike Idomeneus, but he, too quick with a spearcast,[388] struck him in the gorge underneath the chin, and drove the bronze clean through.[389] He fell, as when an oak goes down or a white poplar[390] or like a towering pine tree which in the mountains the carpenters[391] have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship timber.[392] So he lay there felled in front of his horses and chariot,  p 156  [393] roaring, and clawed with his hands at the bloody dust. Meanwhile[394] the charioteer who was close behind him was stricken in the wits[395] and shrinking from the hands of the enemy did not have daring[396] to turn the horses about, but Antilochos stubborn in battle[397] pinned him through the middle with a spearstroke, and the corselet[398] of bronze he wore could not hold, the spear fixed in the middle belly,[399] so that he tumbled, gasping, out of the strong-wrought chariot.[400] But for the horses, Antilochos, son of great-hearted Nestor,[401] drove them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians.[402] Deïphobos in sorrow for Asios now came close[403] in on Idomeneus, and with the bright spear made a cast at him,[404] but Idomeneus with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear[405] since also he was hidden beneath his shield’s perfect circle, that shield[406] he carried, hooped in circles of glaring bronze, and the skins[407] of oxen, fitted with double cross-stays. He was all gathered[408] together under this, and the brazen spear shot over him[409] and the shield gave out a hollow clash as the spear glanced from it.[410] Yet Deïphobos made no utterly vain cast from his strong hand,[411] but struck Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the people,[412] in the liver under the midriff, and at once took the strength from his knees.[413] And Deïphobos vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:[414] “Asios lies not now all unavenged. I think rather[415] as he goes down to Hades of the Gates, the strong one,[416] he will be cheerful at heart, since I have sent him an escort.”[417] He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,[418] and beyond others stirred the spirit in wise Antilochos,[419] yet sorrowful though he was he did not forget his companion[420] but running stood and bestrode him and covered him under the great shield.[421] Thereon Mekisteus, son of Echios, and brilliant Alastor,[422] two staunch companions, stooping beneath it, caught up Hypsenor,[423] and carried him, groaning heavily, to the hollow vessels.[424] Idomeneus did not slacken his great fury, but always[425] was straining to shroud some one of the Trojans in dark night[426] or go down crashing himself as he fought the bane from the Achaians.[427] There was a man, loved son of illustrious Aisyetes,[428] the hero Alkathoös, who was son-in-law of Anchises,[429] and had married the eldest of his daughters, Hippodameia,[430] dear to the hearts of her father and the lady her mother[431] in the great house, since she surpassed all the girls of her own age[432] for beauty and accomplishments and wit; for which reason[433] the man married her who was the best in the wide Troad.[434] But now Poseidon beat him down at the hands of Idomeneus,[435] for he bewitched his shining eyes, made moveless his bright limbs,[436] so that he could not run backward, neither evade him,[437] but stood like a statue or a tree with leaves towering[438] motionless, while fighting Idomeneus stabbed at the middle[439] of his chest with the spear, and broke the bronze armour about him[440] which in time before had guarded his body from destruction.[441] He cried out then, a great cry, broken, the spear in him,[442] and fell, thunderously, and the spear in his heart was stuck fast[443] but the heart was panting still and beating to shake the butt end[444] of the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took his life away from him.  p 157  [445] Idomeneus vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:[446] “Deïphobos, are we then to call this a worthy bargain,[447] three men killed for one? It was you yourself were so boastful.[448] Strange man. Do you rather come yourself and stand up against me[449] so you can see what I am like, Zeus’ seed, come here to face you.[450] Since Zeus first got by Krete Minos, who cared for his people,[451] and to Minos in turn was born a blameless son, Deukalion,[452] and Deukalion sired me to be lord over many people[453] in wide Krete, and now my ships have brought me to this place[454] to be an evil for you and your father and the rest of the Trojans.”[455] So he spoke, and the heart in Deïphobos was divided,[456] pondering whether to draw back and find some other high-hearted[457] Trojan to be his companion, or whether to attempt him singly.[458] And in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[459] to go for Aineias. He found him at the uttermost edge of the battle[460] standing, since he was forever angry with brilliant Priam[461] because great as he was he did him no honour among his people.[462] Deïphobos came and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:[463] “Aineias, lord of the Trojans’ counsels, now there is need of you[464] to stand by your brother-in-law, if this bond of kinship touches you.[465] Come then, stand by Alkathoös, who was your sister’s husband[466] and in time past nursed you in his house when you were still little.[467] But now Idomeneus the spear-famed has killed him in battle.”[468] So he spoke, and stirred the anger in the breast of Aineias.[469] He went against Idomeneus, strongly eager for battle,[470] yet no fear gripped Idomeneus as if he were a stripling,[471] but he stood his ground like a mountain wild boar who in the confidence[472] of his strength stands up to a great rabble of men advancing[473] upon him in some deserted place, and bristles his back up,[474] and both his eyes are shining with fire; he grinds his teeth[475] in his fury to fight off the dogs and the men. So[476] spear-famed Idomeneus held his ground, and would not give way[477] to Aineias coming against him, but bellowed to his companions,[478] looking to Askalaphos, and Aphareus and Deïpyros,[479] at Meriones and Antilochos, both urgent for battle,[480] and stirring all these forward called out to them in winged words:[481] “This way, friends, stand by me, I am alone, and terribly[482] I fear the attack of swift-footed Aineias advancing upon me,[483] powerful as he is for the slaying of men in battle.[484] Likewise the flower of youth is his, where man’s strength is highest,[485] since were we two of the same age, and in this same spirit,[486] soon he would win me in great battle, or I would win him.”[487] So he spoke, and all these, a single spirit within them,[488] came and stood in their numbers and sloped their shields over his shoulders,[489] and Aineias on the other side called to his own companions,[490] looking to Deïphobos, and Paris, and brilliant Agenor[491] who were lords of the Trojans along with him, and the people after them[492] followed on, as when the sheep follow the lead-ram[493] as they leave the pasture to drink, and make proud the heart of the shepherd,[494] and thus also the heart of Aineias was gladdened within him[495] as he saw the swarm of the host following his own leadership.[496] These then drove on in close combat about Alkathoös  p 158  [497] with long spears, and the bronze girding the chests of the fighters[498] clashed horribly to the spears they threw in the press at each other,[499] and two men, for warcraft pre-eminent beyond the others,[500] Aineias and Idomeneus, both men like the war god,[501] were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other.[502] Aineias was first with a spear cast at Idomeneus,[503] but he, keeping his eyes straight on him, avoided the bronze spear,[504] so that the vibrant shaft of Aineias was driven groundward[505] since it had been thrown in a vain cast from his big hand.[506] But Idomeneus hit Oinomaos in the middle belly[507] and broke the hollow of the corselet, so that the entrails spurted[508] from the bronze, and he fell clawing the dust in his fingers.[509] Idomeneus wrenched out the far-shadowing spear from his body[510] but had no power to strip the rest of his splendid armour[511] away from his shoulders, since he was beaten back by their missiles,[512] and no longer in an outrush could his limbs stay steady beneath him[513] either to dash in after his spear, or to get clear again.[514] So in close-standing fight he beat off the pitiless death-day[515] as his feet no longer quick to run took him out of the fighting.[516] As he backed slowly Deïphobos made a cast with the shining[517] spear, since he held a fixed hatred forever against him,[518] but missed him yet once again and struck down with the spear the war god’s[519] son Askalaphos, so that the powerful spear was driven[520] through his shoulder, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground in his fingers.[521] But Ares the huge and bellowing had yet heard nothing[522] of how his son had fallen there in the strong encounter[523] but he, sheltered under the golden clouds on utmost Olympos,[524] was sitting, held fast by command of Zeus, where the rest also[525] of the immortal gods were sitting still, in restraint from the battle.[526] But the men drove on in close combat about Askalaphos.[527] Deïphobos tore from Askalaphos the shining helmet;[528] but now Meriones, a match for the running war god,[529] plunging upon him stabbed his arm with the spear, and the hollow-eyed[530] helmet dropped from his hand and fell to the ground clashing.[531] Meriones in yet another swoop like a vulture[532] plucked out the heavy spear from the arm’s base at the shoulder,[533] then shrank into the host of his own companions. Polites,[534] Deïphobos’ brother, caught him about the waist with both arms[535] and got him out of the sorrowful fighting, and reached his fast-footed[536] horses, where they stood to the rear of the fighting and the battle[537] holding their charioteer and the elaborate chariot,[538] and these carried him, groaning heavily, back to the city[539] in pain, since the blood was running from his arm’s fresh wound.[540] But the rest fought on with clamour incessant rising about them.[541] There Aineias lunging at Aphareus, the son of Kaletor,[542] struck him with the sharp spear in the throat where it was turned toward him.[543] His head bent over to one side, and his shield tumbled,[544] and the helm, and death breaking the spirit drifted about him.[545] Antilochos, watching Thoön as he turned about, dashed in on him[546] and slashed at him, and shore away the entire vein  p 159  [547] which runs all the way up the back till it reaches the neck. This[548] he shore away entire, so he sprawled in the dust backward,[549] reaching out both hands to his beloved companions.[550] Antilochos rushed on him, trying to strip the armour[551] from his shoulders, but watchful, as the Trojans gathered about him[552] from all sides, and beat at the shining broad shield, but could not[553] get within it and tear with the pitiless bronze Antilochos’[554] tender flesh, for about him the earth-shaker Poseidon[555] guarded the son of Nestor even in the swarm of missiles.[556] Since he was not making his way back clear of the enemy,[557] but would turn to face them nor held motionless his spear, always[558] it was shaken or driven forward, the desire in his heart forever[559] to strike someone with a spearcast or drive at him in close combat.[560] Adamas, Asios’ son, was not blind to how he kept aiming[561] with his spear in the battle, and charging close stabbed with the sharp bronze[562] at the shield’s middle, but Poseidon the dark-haired made void[563] his spear’s stroke, nor would let him win the life of Antilochos,[564] and half of the spear was stuck fast like a stake fire-hardened[565] in Antilochos’ shield, and the other half lay on the ground.[566] To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions;[567] but as he went back Meriones dogging him threw with the spear[568] and struck between navel and genitals where beyond all places[569] death in battle comes painfully to pitiful mortals.[570] There the spear stuck fast driven and he, writhing about it,[571] gasped as an ox does when among the mountains the herdsmen[572] have bound him strongly in twisted ropes and drag him unwilling.[573] So he, stricken, gasped for a little while, but not long,[574] until fighting Meriones came close and wrenched the spear out[575] from his body, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.[576] But Helenos closing struck Deïpyros on the temple[577] with a huge Thracian sword, and broke the helmet to pieces[578] so that it was knocked off and fell to the ground. An Achaian[579] picked it up where it rolled among the feet of the fighters;[580] but the darkness of night misted over the eyes of Deïpyros.[581] Then sorrow caught Atreus’ son Menelaos of the great war cry,[582] and he came on menacing and shaking his sharp spear at Helenos[583] the lord and fighter, who pulled against him the bow at the handgrip,[584] and both let fly each other together, one with a sharp spear[585] in a javelin cast, and one with the arrow from the bowstring.[586] The son of Priam hit him then on the chest with an arrow[587] in the hollow of the corselet, but the bitter arrow sprang far back.[588] As along a great threshing floor from the broad blade[589] of a shovel the black-skinned beans and the chickpeas bounce high[590] under the whistling blast and the sweep of the winnowing fan, so[591] back from the corselet of glorious Menelaos the bitter[592] arrow rebounded far away, being driven hard back.[593] But Atreus’ son Menelaos of the great war cry struck him[594] in the hand where he held the polished bow, and the bronze spear[595] was driven clean on through the bow and the hand beyond it.[596] To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions,[597] dangling his wounded hand and dragging the ash spear with it.[598] But great-hearted Agenor drew from his hand the spear  p 160  [599] and bound up his hand with a careful twist of wool fleece[600] in a sling the henchman held for the shepherd of the people.[601] Peisandros now came on straight against Menelaos[602] the glorious, but an evil destiny led him toward death’s end,[603] to be beaten down by you, Menelaos, in the stark encounter.[604] Now when these in their advance were close to each other[605] the son of Atreus missed with his throw, and the spear was turned past him,[606] but Peisandros stabbed with the spear at the shield of glorious[607] Menelaos, but could not drive the bronze all the way through it[608] for the wide shield held against it and the spearshaft was broken[609] behind the head, yet he was light-hearted and hopeful of victory.[610] Drawing his sword with the silver nails, the son of Atreus[611] sprang at Peisandros, who underneath his shield’s cover gripped[612] his beautiful axe with strong bronze blade upon a long polished[613] axe-handle of olive wood. They made their strokes at the same time[614] and Peisandros chopped at the horn of the helmet crested with horse-hair[615] at the very peak. Menelaos struck him as he came onward[616] in the forehead over the base of the nose, and smashed the bones, so that[617] both eyes dropped, bloody, and lay in the dust at his feet before him.[618] He fell, curling, and Menelaos, setting his heel on[619] his chest, stripped off his armour and spoke exulting over him:[620] “So, I think, shall you leave the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans,[621] you haughty Trojans, never to be glutted with the grim war noises,[622] nor go short of all that other shame and defilement[623] wherewith you defiled me, wretched dogs, and your hearts knew no fear[624] at all of the hard anger of Zeus loud-thundering,[625] the guest’s god, who some day will utterly sack your steep city.[626] You who in vanity went away taking with you my wedded[627] wife, and many possessions, when she had received you in kindness.[628] And now once more you rage among our seafaring vessels[629] to throw deadly fire on them and kill the fighting Achaians.[630] But you will be held somewhere, though you be so headlong for battle.[631] Father Zeus, they say your wisdom passes all others’,[632] of men and gods, and yet from you all this is accomplished[633] the way you give these outrageous people your grace, these Trojans[634] whose fighting strength is a thing of blind fury, nor can they ever[635] be glutted full of the close encounters of deadly warfare.[636] Since there is satiety in all things, in sleep, and love-making,[637] in the loveliness of singing and the innocent dance. In all these[638] things a man will strive sooner to win satisfaction[639] than in war; but in this the Trojans cannot be glutted.”[640] So Menelaos the blameless spoke, and stripping the bloody[641] armour away from his body gave it to his companions,[642] and turned back himself to merge in the ranks of the champions.[643] Now there sprang forth against him the son of King Pylaimenes,[644] Harpalion, who had followed his father into the fighting[645] at Troy, and did not come home again to the land of his fathers.[646] He from close up stabbed with his spear at the shield of Atreides[647] in the middle, but could not drive the bronze all the way through it.[648] To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions,[649] looking all about him, for fear somebody might wound him with the bronze;  p 161  [650] but as he went back Meriones let fly at him with a bronze-shod[651] arrow, and hit him beside the right buttock, so that the arrow[652] was driven on through under the bone to fix in the bladder.[653] There, sitting among the arms of his beloved companions,[654] he gasped out his life, then lay like a worm extended[655] along the ground, and his dark blood drenched the ground in its running.[656] And the great-hearted Paphlagonians busied about him,[657] lifted him into a chariot and brought him to sacred Ilion[658] in sorrow, and his father, weeping tears, walked beside them,[659] and no man-price came his way for his son’s slaying.[660] But Paris was deeply angered at heart for this man’s slaying,[661] since he was his guest friend among many Paphlagonians,[662] and in anger for him he also let fly a bronze-shod arrow.[663] There was a man, Euchenor, son of the seer Polyidos,[664] a rich man and good, who lived in his house at Korinth,[665] who knew well that it was his death when he went on shipboard,[666] since many times the good old man Polyidos had told him[667] that he must die in his own house of a painful sickness[668] or go with the ships of the Achaians and be killed by the Trojans.[669] He therefore chose to avoid the troublesome price the Achaians[670] would ask, and the hateful sickness so his heart might not be afflicted.[671] Paris struck him by jaw and ear, and at once the life spirit[672] fled from his limbs, and the hateful darkness closed in about him.[673] So they fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. But meanwhile[674] Hektor beloved of Zeus had not heard of this, and knew nothing[675] of how to the left of the ships his people were being slaughtered[676] by the Argives, and glory for the Achaians might even have been[677] accomplished, such was Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it[678] as he stirred on the Argives and fought for them and his own strength.[679] But Hektor held where first he had broken a way through the rampart[680] and the gates, and shattered the close ranks of the armoured Danaans,[681] where lay the ships of Aias and the ships of Protesilaos[682] hauled up along the beach of the grey sea; and above these[683] the wall they had built lay lowest, and there beyond other places[684] dangerous was the onslaught of the Trojans and of their horses.[685] There the Boiotians, and Ionians with their trailing tunics,[686] the Lokrians and the Phthians, with the shining Epeians[687] tried to hold him as he swept hard for the ships, but they could not[688] avail to beat brilliant flame-like Hektor back from them.[689] There also were the chosen Athenian men, and among them[690] Peteos’ son Menestheus was lord, and there followed with him[691] Pheidas and Stichios and strong Bias; but the Epeians[692] were led by Meges, Phyleus’ son, Amphion and Drakios,[693] and before the Phthians were Medon and battle-stubborn Podarkes.[694] Now of these one, Medon, was bastard son of Oïleus[695] the godlike, and brother of Aias, yet he was living away from[696] the land of his fathers, in Phylake, since he had killed a man,[697] the brother of Eriopis, his stepmother and wife of Oïleus;[698] but the other was son of Iphiklos, the son of Phylakos.[699] And these in arms at the forefront of the great-hearted Phthians[700] fought beside the Boiotians in defence of their vessels.[701] But swift Aias the son of Oïleus would not at all now  p 162  [702] take his stand apart from Telamonian Aias,[703] not even a little; but as two wine-coloured oxen straining[704] with even force drag the compacted plough through the fallow land,[705] and for both of them at the base of the horns the dense sweat gushes;[706] only the width of the polished yoke keeps a space between them[707] as they toil down the furrow till the share cuts the edge of the ploughland;[708] so these took their stand in battle, close to each other.[709] Now with the son of Telamon many people and brave ones[710] followed as companions, and took over the great shield from him[711] whenever the sweat and the weariness came over his body.[712] But no Lokrians went with the great-hearted son of Oïleus.[713] The heart was not in them to endure close-standing combat,[714] for they did not have the brazen helmets crested with horse-hair,[715] they did not have the strong-circled shields and the ash spears,[716] but rather these had followed to Ilion with all their confidence[717] in their bows and slings strong-twisted of wool; and with these[718] they shot their close volleys and broke the Trojan battalions.[719] So now these others fought in front in elaborate war gear[720] against the Trojans and Hektor the brazen-helmed, and the Lokrians[721] unseen volleyed from behind, so the Trojans remembered[722] nothing of the joy of battle, since the shafts struck them to confusion.[723] Now pitifully the Trojans might have gone back from the shelters[724] and the ships, to windy Ilion, had not Poulydamas[725] come and stood beside bold Hektor and spoken a word to him:[726] “Hektor, you are too intractable to listen to reason.[727] Because the god has granted you the actions of warfare[728] therefore you wish in counsel also to be wise beyond others.[729] But you cannot choose to have all gifts given to you together.[730] To one man the god has granted the actions of warfare,[731] to one to be a dancer, to another the lyre and the singing,[732] and in the breast of another Zeus of the wide brows establishes[733] wisdom, a lordly thing, and many take profit beside him[734] and he saves many, but the man’s own thought surpasses all others.[735] Now I will tell you the way that it seems best to my mind.[736] For you, everywhere the fighting burns in a circle around you,[737] but of the great-hearted Trojans since they crossed over the rampart[738] some are standing back in their war gear, others are fighting[739] fewer men against many, being scattered among the vessels.[740] Draw back now, and call to this place all of our bravest,[741] and then we might work out together our general counsel,[742] whether we can fall upon their benched ships, if the god might[743] be willing to give such power to us, or whether thereafter[744] we can win away from the ships unhurt; since I fear[745] the Achaians might wreak on us requital for yesterday;[746] since beside their ships lurks a man insatiate of fighting[747] and I think we can no longer utterly hold him from the fighting.”[748] So spoke Poulydamas, and this counsel of safety pleased Hektor,[749] and at once in all his armour he leapt to the ground from his chariot[750] and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: “Poulydamas,[751] do you rather call back to their place all of our bravest.[752] I am going over there to meet the attack, and afterwards[753] I will come back soon, when I have properly given my orders.”  p 163  [754] So he spoke, and went on his way like a snowy mountain,[755] calling aloud, and swept through the Trojans and their companions.[756] But the rest of them rallied quickly around the son of Panthoös,[757] courtly Poulydamas, each as they heard the command of Hektor.[758] But Hektor ranged the ranks of the foremost fighters, searching[759] for Deïphobos, and the strength of Helenos the prince, and for Asios’[760] son Adamas, and Asios, Hyrtakos’ son, if he might[761] find them; but found them no longer utterly unwounded or living,[762] but some were lying along the sterns of Achaian vessels,[763] they who had lost their lives at the hands of the Argives, and others[764] were lying away inside the city with arrow or spear wounds.[765] But he found one man away to the left of the sorrowful battle,[766] brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,[767] encouraging his companions and urging them on into battle.[768] Hektor came and stood near, and in words of shame he rebuked him:[769] “Evil Paris, beautiful, woman-crazy, cajoling:[770] where is Deïphobos gone, and the strength of the prince Helenos,[771] Adamas, Asios’ son, and Asios, son of Hyrtakos?[772] Where is Othryoneus? Now all steep Ilion is lost[773] utterly; now your own headlong destruction is certain.”[774] Then in turn Alexandros the godlike answered him:[775] “Hektor, since it is your pleasure to blame me when I am blameless,[776] it would be better some other time to withdraw from the fighting[777] than now. My mother bore me not utterly lacking in warcraft.[778] For since that time when by the ships you wakened the battle[779] of our companions, we have stayed here and fought the Danaans[780] without end. And our companions are killed you ask for.[781] Only Deïphobos and the strength of the prince Helenos[782] have gone away, wounded each in the hand by strokes[783] of the long spears, but the son of Kronos fended death from them.[784] Now lead on, wherever your heart and spirit command you,[785] and we shall follow you eagerly; I think that we shall not[786] come short in warcraft, in so far as the strength stays with us.[787] But beyond his strength no man can fight, although he be eager.”[788] So the hero spoke, and persuaded the heart of his brother.[789] They went on, to where the clamour and fighting were greatest,[790] about Kebriones, and Poulydamas the blameless,[791] about Phalkes, and Orthaios, and godlike Polyphetes,[792] Palmys, with Askanios and Morys, sons of Hippotion,[793] who had come over in their turn from fertile Askania[794] on the dawn before, and now Zeus stirred them into the fighting.[795] They went on, as out of the racking winds the stormblast[796] that underneath the thunderstroke of Zeus father drives downward[797] and with gigantic clamour hits the sea, and the numerous[798] boiling waves along the length of the roaring water[799] bend and whiten to foam in ranks, one upon another;[800] so the Trojans closing in ranks, some leading and others[801] after them, in the glare of bronze armour followed their leaders.[802] And Hektor led them, Priam’s son, a man like the murderous[803] war god, and held the perfect circle of his shield before him[804] fenced deep in skins, with a great fold of bronze beaten upon it,[805] and about his temples was shaken as he went the glittering helmet.  p 164  [806] He would step forward, to probe the Achaian battalions at all points,[807] if they might give way where he stalked on under his shield’s cover,[808] but could not so confuse the heart in the breasts of the Achaians.[809] Aias was first to take long strides forward and challenge him:[810] “Man, you are mad. Come closer. Why try this way to terrify[811] the Argives? It is not that we are so unskilled in fighting,[812] but by the wicked whiplash of Zeus we Achaians are beaten.[813] I suppose, then, your heart is hopeful utterly to break up[814] our ships? We too have prompt hands among us strong to defend them.[815] Rather, far before this your own strong-founded citadel[816] must go down under our hands, stormed and utterly taken.[817] And for yourself I say that the time is close, when in flight[818] you will pray to Zeus father and the other immortals[819] that your bright-maned horses might be swifter than hawks are[820] as they carry you through the stirred dust of the plain to your city.”[821] As he spoke so, an ominous bird winged by at his right hand,[822] a towering eagle, and the host of the Achaians, made brave[823] by the bird sign, shouted, but glorious Hektor answered him:[824] “Aias, you inarticulate ox, what is this you have spoken?[825] If I could only be called son to Zeus of the aegis[826] all the days of my life, and the lady Hera my mother,[827] and I be honoured, as Apollo and Athene are honoured,[828] so surely as this is a day that brings evil to the Argives,[829] all, and you will be killed with the rest of them, if you have daring[830] to stand up against my long spear, which will bite your delicate[831] body; yet then you will glut the dogs and birds of the Trojans[832] with fat and flesh, struck down beside the ships of the Achaians.”[833] So he spoke and led the way, and the rest of them followed him[834] with unearthly clamour, and all the people shouted behind him.[835] But the Argives on the other side cried out, and would not[836] forget their warcraft, but stood the attack of the bravest Trojans,[837] and the clamour from both was driven high to Zeus’ shining aether.book fourteen[1] Now Nestor failed not to hear their outcry, though he was drinking[2] his wine, but spoke in winged words to the son of Asklepios:[3] “Take thought how these things shall be done, brilliant Machaon.[4] Beside the ships the cry of the strong young men grows greater.[5] Now, do you sit here and go on drinking the bright wine,[6] until Hekamede the lovely-haired makes ready a hot bath[7] for you, warming it, and washes away the filth of the bloodstains,[8] while I go out and make my way till I find some watchpoint.”[9] So he spoke, and took up the wrought shield of his son[10] Thrasymedes, breaker of horses. It lay in the shelter[11] all shining in bronze. Thrasymedes carried the shield of his father.[12] Then he caught up a powerful spear edged in sharp bronze[13] and stood outside the shelter, and at once saw a shameful action,[14] men driven to flight, and others harrying them in confusion,[15] the great-hearted Trojans, and the wall of the Achaians overthrown.[16] As when the open sea is deeply stirred to the ground-swell  p 165  [17] but stays in one place and waits the rapid onset of tearing[18] gusts, nor rolls its surf onward in either direction[19] until from Zeus the wind is driven down to decide it;[20] so the aged man pondered, his mind caught between two courses,[21] whether to go among the throng of fast-mounted Danaans[22] or in search of Atreus’ son Agamemnon, shepherd of the people.[23] And in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[24] to go after the son of Atreus, while the rest went on with the murderous[25] battle, and the weariless bronze about their bodies was clashing[26] as the men were stabbing with swords and leaf-headed spears.[27] Now there came toward Nestor the kings under God’s hand, they who[28] had been wounded by the bronze and came back along the ships, Tydeus’[29] son and Odysseus, and Atreus’ son Agamemnon. For there[30] were ships that had been hauled up far away from the fighting[31] along the beach of the grey sea. They had hauled up the first ones[32] on the plain, and by the sterns of these had built their defences;[33] for, wide as it was, the sea-shore was not big enough to make room[34] for all the ships, and the people also were straitened; and therefore[35] they had hauled them up in depth, and filled up the long edge[36] of the whole sea-coast, all that the two capes compassed between them.[37] These lords walked in a group, each leaning on his spear, to look at[38] the clamorous battle, and for each the heart inside his body[39] was sorrowful; and Nestor the aged man who now met them[40] made still more cast down the spirit inside the Achaians.[41] Now powerful Agamemnon spoke aloud and addressed him:[42] “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,[43] why have you left the fighting where men die, and come back here?[44] I am afraid huge Hektor may accomplish that word against me[45] that he spoke, threatening, among the Trojans assembled,[46] that he would not make his way back from the ships toward Ilion[47] until he had set the ships on fire, and killed the men in them.[48] So he spoke then; now all these things are being accomplished.[49] Oh, shame, for I think that all the other strong-greaved Achaians[50] are storing anger against me in their hearts, as Achilleus[51] did, and no longer will fight for me by the grounded vessels.”[52] Then answered him in turn the Gerenian horseman Nestor:[53] “All these things have been brought to fulfilment, nor in any other[54] way could even Zeus who thunders on high accomplish it.[55] For the wall has gone down in which we put our trust, that it[56] would be a protection for our ships and us, and could not be broken,[57] and our men beside the fast ships are fighting incessantly[58] without end, nor could you tell any more, though you looked hard,[59] from which side the Achaians are broken into confusion,[60] so indiscriminately are they killed, and their crying goes skyward.[61] We then must take thought together how these things shall be done[62] if wit can do anything for us now. I think that we must not[63] enter the fight; a man cannot fight on when he is wounded.”[64] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:[65] “Nestor, since now they are fighting beside the grounded vessels[66] and the wall we built has done us no good, nor the ditch either[67] where the Danaans endured so much, and their hearts were hopeful[68] it would be a protection to their ships and them, and could not be broken,  p 166  [69] then such is the way it must be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,[70] that the Achaians must die here forgotten and far from Argos.[71] For I knew it, when with full heart he defended the Danaans,[72] and I know it now, when he glorifies these people as if they[73] were blessed gods, and has hobbled our warcraft and our hands’ strength.[74] Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us[75] take all those ships that are beached near the sea in the first line[76] and haul them down, and row them out on the shining water,[77] and moor them at anchor stones out on the deep water, until[78] the immortal Night comes down, if the Trojans will give over fighting[79] for Night’s sake; then we might haul down all the rest of our vessels.[80] There is no shame in running, even by night, from disaster.[81] The man does better who runs from disaster than he who is caught by it.”[82] Then looking darkly at him spoke resourceful Odysseus:[83] “Son of Atreus, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[84] Ruinous! I wish you directed some other unworthy[85] army, and were not lord over us, over us to whom Zeus[86] has appointed the accomplishing of wars, from our youth[87] even into our old age until we are dead, each of us.[88] Are you really thus eager to abandon the wide-wayed city[89] of the Trojans, over which we have taken so many sorrows?[90] Do not say it; for fear some other Achaian might hear this[91] word, which could never at all get past the lips of any man[92] who understood inside his heart how to speak soundly,[93] who was a sceptred king, and all the people obeyed him[94] in numbers like those of Argives, whose lord you are.[95] Now I utterly despise your heart for the thing you have spoken;[96] you who in the very closing of clamorous battle[97] tell us to haul our strong-benched ships to the sea, so that even[98] more glory may befall the Trojans, who beat us already,[99] and headlong destruction swing our way, since the Achaians[100] will not hold their battle as the ships are being hauled seaward,[101] but will look about, and let go the exultation of fighting.[102] There, o leader of the people, your plan will be ruin.”[103] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:[104] “Odysseus, you have hit me somewhere deep in my feelings[105] with this hard word. But I am not telling the sons of the Achaians[106] against their will to drag their benched ships down to the water.[107] Now let someone speak who has better counsel than this was;[108] young man or old; and what he says will be to my liking.”[109] Now among them spoke Diomedes of the great war cry:[110] “That man is here, we shall not look far for him, if you are willing[111] to listen, and not be each astonished in anger against me[112] because by birth I am the youngest among you. I also[113] can boast that my generation is of an excellent father,[114] Tydeus, whom now the heaped earth covers over in Thebe.[115] For there were three blameless sons who were born to Portheus,[116] and their home was in Pleuron and headlong Kalydon. Agrios[117] was first, then Melas, and the third was Oineus the horseman,[118] the father of my father, and in valour beyond the others.[119] But Oineus stayed in the land, while my father was driven and settled[120] in Argos. Such was the will of Zeus and the other immortals.  p 167  [121] He married one of the daughters of Adrestos, and established[122] a house rich in substance, and plenty of wheat-grown acres[123] were his, with many orchards of fruit trees circled about him,[124] and many herds were his. He surpassed all other Achaians[125] with the spear. If all this is true, you must have heard of it.[126] Therefore you could not, saying that I was base and unwarlike[127] by birth, dishonour any word that I speak, if I speak well.[128] Let us go back to the fighting wounded as we are. We have to.[129] Once there, we must hold ourselves out of the onfall, clear of[130] missiles, so that none will add to the wound he has got already,[131] but we shall be there to drive them on, since even before this[132] they have favoured their anger, and stood far off, and will not fight for us.”[133] So he spoke, and they listened well to him, and obeyed him,[134] and went on their way. And the lord of men, Agamemnon, led them.[135] Neither did the glorious shaker of the earth keep blind watch,[136] but came among them now in the likeness of an old man,[137] and took hold of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, by the right hand,[138] and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: “Son of Atreus,[139] I think that now that baleful heart in the breast of Achilleus[140] must be happy as he stares at the slaughter of the Achaians[141] and their defeat. There is no heart in him, not even a little.[142] Even so may the god strike him down, let him go to destruction.[143] But with you the blessed gods are not utterly angry.[144] There will still be a time when the lords of Troy and their counsellors[145] shall send dust wide on the plain, and you yourself shall look on them[146] as they take flight for their city away from the ships and the shelters.”[147] So he spoke, and swept on over the plain, with a huge cry[148] like the yell nine thousand men send up, or ten thousand[149] in battle, as they close in the hateful strife of the war god.[150] So huge was the cry the powerful earth-shaker let go[151] from his lungs, and in the heart of every Achaian implanted[152] great strength, to carry the battle on, and fight without flinching.[153] Now Hera, she of the golden throne, standing on Olympos’[154] horn, looked out with her eyes, and saw at once how Poseidon,[155] who was her very brother and her lord’s brother, was bustling[156] about the battle where men win glory, and her heart was happy.[157] Then she saw Zeus, sitting along the loftiest summit[158] on Ida of the springs, and in her eyes he was hateful.[159] And now the lady ox-eyed Hera was divided in purpose[160] as to how she could beguile the brain in Zeus of the aegis.[161] And to her mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,[162] to array herself in loveliness, and go down to Ida,[163] and perhaps he might be taken with desire to lie in love with her[164] next her skin, and she might be able to drift an innocent[165] warm sleep across his eyelids, and seal his crafty perceptions.[166] She went into her chamber, which her beloved son Hephaistos[167] had built for her, and closed the leaves in the door-posts snugly[168] with a secret door-bar, and no other of the gods could open it.[169] There entering she drew shut the leaves of the shining door, then[170] first from her adorable body washèd away all stains[171] with ambrosia, and next anointed herself with ambrosial[172] sweet olive oil, which stood there in its fragrance beside her,  p 168  [173] and from which, stirred in the house of Zeus by the golden pavement,[174] a fragrance was shaken forever forth, on earth and in heaven.[175] When with this she had anointed her delicate body[176] and combed her hair, next with her hands she arranged the shining[177] and lovely and ambrosial curls along her immortal[178] head, and dressed in an ambrosial robe that Athene[179] had made her carefully, smooth, and with many figures upon it,[180] and pinned it across her breast with a golden brooch, and circled[181] her waist about with a zone that floated a hundred tassels,[182] and in the lobes of her carefully pierced ears she put rings[183] with triple drops in mulberry clusters, radiant with beauty,[184] and, lovely among goddesses, she veiled her head downward[185] with a sweet fresh veil that glimmered pale like the sunlight.[186] Underneath her shining feet she bound on the fair sandals.[187] Now, when she had clothed her body in all this loveliness,[188] she went out from the chamber, and called aside Aphrodite[189] to come away from the rest of the gods, and spoke a word to her:[190] “Would you do something for me, dear child, if I were to ask you?[191] Or would you refuse it? Are you forever angered against me[192] because I defend the Danaans, while you help the Trojans?”[193] Then the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, answered her: “Hera,[194] honoured goddess, daughter to mighty Kronos, speak forth[195] whatever is in your mind. My heart is urgent to do it[196] if I can, and if it is a thing that can be accomplished.”[197] Then, with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered her:[198] “Give me loveliness and desirability, graces[199] with which you overwhelm mortal men, and all the immortals.[200] Since I go now to the ends of the generous earth, on a visit[201] to Okeanos, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother[202] who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me[203] and took me from Rheia, at that time when Zeus of the wide brows[204] drove Kronos underneath the earth and the barren water.[205] I shall go to visit these, and resolve their division of discord,[206] since now for a long time they have stayed apart from each other[207] and from the bed of love, since rancour has entered their feelings.[208] Could I win over with persuasion the dear heart within them[209] and bring them back to their bed to be merged in love with each other[210] I shall be forever called honoured by them, and beloved.”[211] Then in turn Aphrodite the laughing answered her:[212] “I cannot, and I must not deny this thing that you ask for,[213] you, who lie in the arms of Zeus, since he is our greatest.”[214] She spoke, and from her breasts unbound the elaborate, pattern-pierced[215] zone, and on it are figured all beguilements, and loveliness[216] is figured upon it, and passion of sex is there, and the whispered[217] endearment that steals the heart away even from the thoughtful.[218] She put this in Hera’s hands, and called her by name and spoke to her:[219] “Take this zone, and hide it away in the fold of your bosom.[220] It is elaborate, all things are figured therein. And I think[221] whatever is your heart’s desire shall not go unaccomplished.”[222] So she spoke, and the ox-eyed lady Hera smiled on her[223] and smiling hid the zone away in the fold of her bosom.[224] So Aphrodite went back into the house, Zeus’ daughter,  p 169  [225] while Hera in a flash of speed left the horn of Olympos[226] and crossed over Pieria and Emathia the lovely[227] and overswept the snowy hills of the Thracian riders[228] and their uttermost pinnacles, nor touched the ground with her feet. Then[229] from Athos she crossed over the heaving main sea[230] and came to Lemnos, and to the city of godlike Thoas.[231] There she encountered Sleep, the brother of Death. She clung[232] fast to his hand and spoke a word and called him by name: “Sleep,[233] lord over all mortal men and all gods, if ever[234] before now you listened to word of mine, so now also[235] do as I ask; and all my days I shall know gratitude.[236] Put to sleep the shining eyes of Zeus under his brows[237] as soon as I have lain beside him in love. I will give you[238] gifts; a lovely throne, imperishable forever,[239] of gold. My own son, he of the strong arms, Hephaistos,[240] shall make it with careful skill and make for your feet a footstool[241] on which you can rest your shining feet when you take your pleasure.”[242] Then Sleep the still and soft spoke to her in answer:[243] “Hera, honoured goddess and daughter of mighty Kronos,[244] any other one of the gods, whose race is immortal,[245] I would lightly put to sleep, even the stream of that River[246] Okeanos, whence is risen the seed of all the immortals.[247] But I would not come too close to Zeus, the son of Kronos,[248] nor put him to sleep, unless when he himself were to tell me.[249] Before now, it was a favour to you that taught me wisdom,[250] on the day Herakles, the high-hearted son of Zeus, was sailing[251] from Ilion, when he had utterly sacked the city of the Trojans.[252] That time I laid to sleep the brain in Zeus of the aegis[253] and drifted upon him still and soft, but your mind was devising[254] evil, and you raised along the sea the blasts of the racking[255] winds, and on these swept him away to Kos, the strong-founded,[256] with all his friends lost, but Zeus awakened in anger[257] and beat the gods up and down his house, looking beyond all others[258] for me, and would have sunk me out of sight in the sea from the bright sky[259] had not Night who has power over gods and men rescued me.[260] I reached her in my flight, and Zeus let be, though he was angry[261] in awe of doing anything to swift Night’s displeasure.[262] Now you ask me to do this other impossible thing for you.”[263] Then in turn the lady ox-eyed Hera answered him:[264] “Sleep, why do you ponder this in your heart, and hesitate?[265] Or do you think that Zeus of the wide brows, aiding the Trojans,[266] will be angry as he was angry for his son, Herakles?[267] Come now, do it, and I will give you one of the younger[268] Graces for you to marry, and she shall be called your lady;[269] Pasithea, since all your days you have loved her forever.”[270] So she spoke, and Sleep was pleased and spoke to her in answer:[271] “Come then! Swear it to me on Styx’ ineluctable water.[272] With one hand take hold of the prospering earth, with the other[273] take hold of the shining salt sea, so that all the undergods[274] who gather about Kronos may be witnesses to us.[275] Swear that you will give me one of the younger Graces,[276] Pasithea, the one whom all my days I have longed for.”  p 170  [277] He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess Hera of the white arms,[278] and she swore as he commanded, and called by their names on all those[279] gods who live beneath the Pit, and who are called Titans.[280] Then when she had sworn this, and made her oath a complete thing,[281] the two went away from Lemnos, and the city of Imbros,[282] and mantled themselves in mist, and made their way very lightly[283] till they came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,[284] to Lekton, where first they left the water, and went on[285] over dry land, and with their feet the top of the forest was shaken.[286] There Sleep stayed, before the eyes of Zeus could light on him,[287] and went up aloft a towering pine tree, the one that grew tallest[288] at that time on Ida, and broke through the close air to the aether.[289] In this he sat, covered over and hidden by the pine branches,[290] in the likeness of a singing bird whom in the mountains[291] the immortal gods call chalkis, but men call him kymindis.[292] But Hera light-footed made her way to the peak of Gargaros[293] on towering Ida. And Zeus who gathers the clouds saw her,[294] and when he saw her desire was a mist about his close heart[295] as much as on that time they first went to bed together[296] and lay in love, and their dear parents knew nothing of it.[297] He stood before her and called her by name and spoke to her: “Hera,[298] what is your desire that you come down here from Olympos?[299] And your horses are not here, nor your chariot, which you would ride in.”[300] Then with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered him:[301] “I am going to the ends of the generous earth, on a visit[302] to Okeanos, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother,[303] who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me.[304] I shall go to visit these, and resolve their division of discord,[305] since now for a long time they have stayed apart from each other[306] and from the bed of love, since rancour has entered their feelings.[307] In the foothills by Ida of the waters are standing[308] my horses, who will carry me over hard land and water.[309] Only now I have come down here from Olympos for your sake[310] so you will not be angry with me afterwards, if I[311] have gone silently to the house of deep-running Okeanos.”[312] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:[313] “Hera, there will be a time afterwards when you can go there[314] as well. But now let us go to bed and turn to love-making.[315] For never before has love for any goddess or woman[316] so melted about the heart inside me, broken it to submission,[317] as now: not that time when I loved the wife of Ixion[318] who bore me Peirithoös, equal of the gods in counsel,[319] nor when I loved Akrisios’ daughter, sweet-stepping Danaë,[320] who bore Perseus to me, pre-eminent among all men,[321] nor when I loved the daughter of far-renowned Phoinix, Europa[322] who bore Minos to me, and Rhadamanthys the godlike;[323] not when I loved Semele, or Alkmene in Thebe,[324] when Alkmene bore me a son, Herakles the strong-hearted,[325] while Semele’s son was Dionysos, the pleasure of mortals;[326] not when I loved the queen Demeter of the lovely tresses,[327] not when it was glorious Leto, nor yourself, so much[328] as now I love you, and the sweet passion has taken hold of me.”  p 171  [329] Then with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered him:[330] “Most honoured son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[331] If now your great desire is to lie in love together[332] here on the peaks of Ida, everything can be seen. Then[333] what would happen if some one of the gods everlasting[334] saw us sleeping, and went and told all the other immortals[335] of it? I would not simply rise out of bed and go back[336] again, into your house, and such a thing would be shameful.[337] No, if this is your heart’s desire, if this is your wish, then[338] there is my chamber, which my beloved son Hephaistos[339] has built for me, and closed the leaves in the door-posts snugly.[340] We can go back there and lie down, since bed is your pleasure.”[341] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:[342] “Hera, do not fear that any mortal or any god[343] will see, so close shall be the golden cloud that I gather[344] about us. Not even Helios can look at us through it,[345] although beyond all others his light has the sharpest vision.”[346] So speaking, the son of Kronos caught his wife in his arms. There[347] underneath them the divine earth broke into young, fresh[348] grass, and into dewy clover, crocus and hyacinth[349] so thick and soft it held the hard ground deep away from them.[350] There they lay down together and drew about them a golden[351] wonderful cloud, and from it the glimmering dew descended.[352] So the father slept unshaken on the peak of Gargaron[353] with his wife in his arms, when sleep and passion had stilled him;[354] but gently Sleep went on the run to the ships of the Achaians[355] with a message to tell him who circles the earth and shakes it,[356] Poseidon, and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:[357] “Poseidon, now with all your heart defend the Danaans[358] and give them glory, though only for a little, while Zeus still[359] sleeps; since I have mantled a soft slumber about him[360] and Hera beguiled him into sleeping in love beside her.”[361] He spoke so, and went away among the famed races[362] of men, and stirred Poseidon even more to defend the Danaans.[363] He sprang among their foremost and urged them on in a great voice:[364] “Argives, now once more must we give the best of it to Hektor,[365] Priam’s son, so he may take our ships and win glory from them?[366] Such is his thought and such is his prayer, because now Achilleus[367] in the anger of his heart stays still among the hollow ships.[368] But there will not be too much longing for him, if the others[369] of us can stir ourselves up to stand by each other.[370] Come; then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us[371] take those shields which are best in all the army and biggest[372] and put them on, and cover our heads in the complete shining[373] of helmets, and take in our hands our spears that are longest[374] and go. I myself will lead the way, and I think that no longer[375] Hektor, Priam’s son, can stand up to us, for all his fury.[376] Let the man stubborn in battle who wears a small shield on his shoulder[377] give it to a worse man, and put on the shield that is bigger.”[378] So he spoke, and they listened hard to him, and obeyed him.[379] The kings in person marshalled these men, although they were wounded,[380] Tydeus’ son, and Odysseus, and Atreus’ son Agamemnon.  p 172  [381] They went among all, and made them exchange their armour of battle,[382] and the good fighter put on the good armour, and each gave the worse gear[383] to the worse. Then when in the shining bronze they had shrouded their bodies[384] they went forward, and Poseidon the shaker of the earth led them[385] holding in his heavy hand the stark sword with the thin edge[386] glittering, as glitters the thunderflash none may close with[387] by right in sorrowful division, but fear holds all men back.[388] On the other side glorious Hektor ordered the Trojans,[389] and now Poseidon of the dark hair and glorious Hektor[390] strained to its deadliest the division of battle, the one[391] bringing power to the Trojans, and the god to the Argives.[392] The breaking of the sea washed up to the ships and the shelters[393] of the Argives. The two sides closed together with a great war cry.[394] Not such is the roaring against dry land of the sea’s surf[395] as it rolls in from the open under the hard blast of the north wind;[396] not such is the bellowing of fire in its blazing[397] in the deep places of the hills when it rises inflaming the forest,[398] nor such again the crying voice of the wind in the deep-haired[399] oaks, when it roars highest in its fury against them,[400] not so loud as now the noise of Achaians and Trojans[401] in voice of terror rose as they drove against one another.[402] First glorious Hektor made a cast with his spear at Aias[403] since he had turned straight against him, nor missed with his throw[404] but struck, there where over his chest were crossed the two straps,[405] one for the sword with the silver nails, and one for the great shield.[406] These guarded the tenderness of his skin. And Hektor, in anger[407] because his weapon had been loosed from his hand in a vain cast,[408] to avoid death shrank into the host of his own companions.[409] But as he drew away huge Telamonian Aias[410] caught up a rock; there were many, holding-stones for the fast ships,[411] rolled among the feet of the fighters; he caught up one of these[412] and hit him in the chest next the throat over his shield rim,[413] and spun him around like a top with the stroke, so that he staggered[414] in a circle; as a great oak goes down root-torn under[415] Zeus father’s stroke, and a horrible smell of sulphur uprises[416] from it, and there is no courage left in a man who stands by[417] and looks on, for the thunderstroke of great Zeus is a hard thing;[418] so Hektor in all his strength dropped suddenly in the dust, let[419] fall the spear from his hand, and his shield was beaten upon him,[420] and the helm, and his armour elaborate with bronze clashed over him.[421] Screaming aloud the sons of the Achaians ran forward[422] in hope to drag him away, and threw their volleying javelins[423] against him, yet no man could stab or cast at the shepherd[424] of the people; sooner the Trojans’ bravest gathered about him,[425] Aineias, and Poulydamas, and brilliant Agenor,[426] Sarpedon, lord of the Lykians, and Glaukos the blameless;[427] and of the rest no man was heedless of him, but rather[428] sloped the strong circles of their shields over him, while his companions[429] caught him in their arms out of the fighting and reached his fast-footed[430] horses, where they stood to the rear of the fighting and the battle  p 173  [431] holding their charioteer and the elaborate chariot,[432] and these carried him, groaning heavily, back toward the city.[433] But when they came to the crossing place of the fair-running river,[434] of whirling Xanthos, whose father was Zeus the immortal,[435] they moved him from behind his horses to the ground, and splashed[436] water over him. He got his wind again, and his eyes cleared,[437] and he got up to lean on one knee and vomit a dark clot[438] of blood, then lay back on the ground again, while over both eyes[439] dark night misted. His strength was still broken by the stone’s stroke.[440] But the Argives, when they saw Hektor withdrawing from them,[441] remembered once again their warcraft and turned on the Trojans.[442] There far before them all swift Aias son of Oïleus[443] made an outrush, and stabbed with the sharp spear Satnios,[444] Enops’ son, whom the perfect naiad nymph had borne once[445] to Enops, as he tended his herds by Satnioeis river.[446] The spear-famed son of Oïleus, coming close to this man,[447] stabbed him in the flank so that he knocked him backward, and over him[448] Trojans and Danaans closed together in strong encounter.[449] Poulydamas of the shaken spear came up to stand by him,[450] Panthoös’ son, and struck in the right shoulder Prothoënor[451] son of Areïlykos, and the powerful spear was driven[452] through the shoulder, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground in his fingers.[453] Poulydamas vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:[454] “I think this javelin leaping from the heavy hand of Panthoös’[455] high-hearted son was not thrown away in a vain cast. Rather[456] some Argive caught it in his skin. I think he has got it[457] for a stick to lean on as he trudges down into Death’s house.”[458] He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,[459] and beyond others he stirred the anger in wise Telamonian[460] Aias, for the man had fallen closest to him, and at once[461] he made a cast with the shining spear at returning Poulydamas.[462] But Poulydamas himself avoided the dark death[463] with a quick spring to one side, and Archelochos son of Antenor[464] caught the spear, since the immortal gods had doomed his destruction.[465] He hit him at the joining place of head and neck, at the last[466] vertebra, and cut through both of the tendons, so that[467] the man’s head and mouth and nose hit the ground far sooner[468] than did the front of his legs and knees as he fell. And Aias[469] spoke aloud in answer to unfaulted Poulydamas:[470] “Think over this, Poulydamas, and answer me truly.[471] Is not this man’s death against Prothoënor’s a worthwhile[472] exchange? I think he is no mean man, nor born of mean fathers,[473] but is some brother of Antenor, breaker of horses,[474] or his son; since he is close in blood by the look of him.”[475] He spoke, knowing well what he said, and sorrow fastened on the Trojans.[476] There Akamas, bestriding his brother, stabbed the Boiotian[477] Promachos with the spear as he tried to drag off the body.[478] Akamas vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:[479] “You Argives, arrow-fighters, insatiate of menace. I think[480] we shall not be the only ones to be given hard work  p 174  [481] and sorrow, but you too must sometimes die, as this man did.[482] Think how Promachos sleeps among you, beaten down under[483] my spear, so that punishment for my brother may not go[484] long unpaid. Therefore a man prays he will leave behind him[485] one close to him in his halls to avenge his downfall in battle.”[486] He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,[487] and beyond others he stirred the anger in wise Peneleos.[488] He charged Akamas, who would not stand up against the onset[489] of lord Peneleos. He then stabbed with the spear Ilioneus[490] the son of Phorbas the rich in sheepflocks, whom beyond all men[491] of the Trojans Hermes loved, and gave him possessions.[492] Ilioneus was the only child his mother had borne him.[493] This man Peneleos caught underneath the brow, at the bases[494] of the eye, and pushed the eyeball out, and the spear went clean through[495] the eye-socket and tendon of the neck, so that he went down[496] backward, reaching out both hands, but Peneleos drawing[497] his sharp sword hewed at the neck in the middle, and so dashed downward[498] the head, with helm upon it, while still on the point of the big spear[499] the eyeball stuck. He, lifting it high like the head of a poppy,[500] displayed it to the Trojans and spoke vaunting over it:[501] “Trojans, tell haughty Ilioneus’ beloved father[502] and mother, from me, that they can weep for him in their halls, since[503] neither shall the wife of Promachos, Alegenor’s[504] son, take pride of delight in her dear lord’s coming, on that day[505] when we sons of the Achaians come home from Troy in our vessels.”[506] So he spoke, and the shivers came over the limbs of all of them,[507] and each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.[508] Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,[509] who was first of the Achaians to win the bloody despoilment[510] of men, when the glorious shaker of the earth bent the way of the battle?[511] First Telamonian Aias cut down Hyrtios, he who[512] was son to Gyrtios, and lord over the strong-hearted Mysians.[513] Antilochos slaughtered Phalkes and Mermeros. Morys[514] and Hippotion were killed by Meriones. Teukros cut down[515] Periphetes and Prothoön. Next the son of Atreus,[516] Menelaos, stabbed Hyperenor, shepherd of the people,[517] in the flank, so the bronze head let gush out the entrails[518] through the torn side. His life came out through the wound of the spearstab[519] in beating haste, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.[520] But Aias the fast-footed son of Oïleus caught and killed most,[521] since there was none like him in the speed of his feet to go after[522] men who ran, once Zeus had driven the terror upon them.book fifteen[1] But after they had crossed back over the ditch and the sharp stakes[2] in flight, and many had gone down under the hands of the Danaans,[3] they checked about once more and stood their ground by the chariots,[4] green for fear and terrified. But now Zeus wakened[5] by Hera of the gold throne on the high places of Ida,[6] and stood suddenly upright, and saw the Achaians and Trojans,  p 175  [7] these driven to flight, the others harrying them in confusion,[8] these last Argives, and saw among them the lord Poseidon.[9] He saw Hektor lying in the plain, his companions sitting[10] around him, he dazed at the heart and breathing painfully,[11] vomiting blood, since not the weakest Achaian had hit him.[12] Then the father of gods and men seeing Hektor pitied him[13] and looked scowling terribly at Hera, and spoke a word to her:[14] “Hopeless one, it was your evil design, your treachery, Hera,[15] that stayed brilliant Hektor from battle, terrified his people.[16] I do not know, perhaps for this contrivance of evil[17] and pain you will win first reward when I lash you with whip strokes.[18] Do you not remember that time you hung from high and on your feet[19] I slung two anvils, and about your hands drove a golden[20] chain, unbreakable. You among the clouds and the bright sky[21] hung, nor could the gods about tall Olympos endure it[22] and stood about, but could not set you free. If I caught one[23] I would seize and throw him from the threshold, until he landed[24] stunned on the earth, yet even so the weariless agony[25] for Herakles the godlike would not let go my spirit.[26] You with the north wind’s aid winning over the stormwinds drove him[27] on across the desolate sea in evil intention[28] and then on these swept him away to Kos, the strong-founded.[29] I myself rescued him there and brought him back once more[30] to horse-pasturing Argos, when he had been through much hardship.[31] I will remind you of all this, so you will give up[32] your deceptions, see if your love-making in bed will help you,[33] that way you lay with me apart from the gods, and deceived me.”[34] He spoke, and the lady the ox-eyed goddess Hera was frightened[35] and she spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: “Now let[36] Earth be my witness in this, and the wide heaven above us,[37] and the dripping water of the Styx, which oath is the biggest[38] and most formidable oath among the blessed immortals.[39] The sanctity of your head be witness, and the bed of marriage[40] between us: a thing by which I at least could never swear vainly.[41] It is not through my will that the shaker of the earth Poseidon[42] afflicts the Trojans and Hektor and gives aid to the others,[43] but it is his own passion that urges him to it and drives him.[44] He saw the Achaians hard pressed beside their ships, and pitied them.[45] No, but I myself also would give him counsel[46] to go with you, o dark clouded, that way that you lead us.”[47] She spoke, and now the father of gods and men smiled on her[48] and spoke again in answer to her, and addressed her in winged words:[49] “If even you, lady Hera of the ox eyes, hereafter[50] were to take your place among the immortals thinking as I do,[51] then Poseidon, hard though he may wish it otherwise,[52] must at once turn his mind so it follows your heart, and my heart.[53] If now all this that you say is real, and you speak truthfully,[54] go now among the generations of the gods, and summon[55] Iris to come here to me, and Apollo the glorious archer,[56] so that Iris may go among the bronze-armoured people[57] of the Achaians, and give a message to lord Poseidon[58] to leave the fighting and come back to the home that is his. Also  p 176  [59] let Phoibos Apollo stir Hektor back into battle,[60] breathe strength into him once more, and make him forget the agonies[61] that now are wearing out his senses. Let him drive strengthless[62] panic into the Achaians, and turn them back once more;[63] let them be driven in flight and tumble back on the benched ships[64] of Achilleus, Peleus’ son. And he shall rouse up Patroklos[65] his companion. And glorious Hektor shall cut down Patroklos[66] with the spear before Ilion, after he has killed many others[67] of the young men, and among them my own son, shining Sarpedon.[68] In anger for him brilliant Achilleus shall then kill Hektor.[69] And from then on I would make the fighting surge back from the vessels[70] always and continuously, until the Achaians[71] capture headlong Ilion through the designs of Athene.[72] Before this I am not stopping my anger, and I will not let[73] any other of the immortals stand there by the Danaans[74] until the thing asked by the son of Peleus has been accomplished[75] as I undertook at the first and bent my head in assent to it[76] on that day when embracing my knees immortal Thetis[77] supplicated honour for Achilleus, sacker of cities.”[78] He spoke, and the goddess of the white arms Hera did not disobey him[79] but went back to tall Olympos from the mountains of Ida.[80] As the thought flashes in the mind of a man who, traversing[81] much territory, thinks of things in the mind’s awareness,[82] “I wish I were this place, or this,” and imagines many things;[83] so rapidly in her eagerness winged Hera, a goddess.[84] She came to sheer Olympos and entered among the assembled[85] immortal gods in the house of Zeus, and they seeing her[86] rose all to swarm about her and lifted their cups in greeting.[87] But Hera passed by the others and accepted a cup from Themis[88] of the fair cheeks, since she had first come running to greet her[89] and had spoken to her and addressed her in winged words: “Hera,[90] why have you come? You seem like one who has been terrified.[91] I know, it was the son of Kronos, your husband, frightened you.”[92] In turn the goddess Hera of the white arms answered her:[93] “Ask me nothing of this, divine Themis. You yourself[94] know what his spirit is, how it is stubborn and arrogant.[95] Preside still over the gods in their house, the feast’s fair division.[96] Yet so much may you hear, and with you all the immortals,[97] how Zeus discloses evil actions, and I do not think[98] the heart of all will be pleasured alike, neither among mortals[99] nor gods either, although one now still feasts at his pleasure.”[100] The lady Hera spoke so and sat down, and the gods[101] about the house of Zeus were troubled. Hera was smiling[102] with her lips, but above the dark brows her forehead[103] was not at peace. She spoke before them all in vexation:[104] “Fools, we who try to work against Zeus, thoughtlessly.[105] Still we are thinking in our anger to go near, and stop him[106] by argument or force. He sits apart and cares nothing[107] nor thinks of us, and says that among the other immortals[108] he is pre-eminently the greatest in power and strength. Therefore[109] each of you must take whatever evil he sends you.[110] Since I think already a sorrow has been wrought against Ares.  p 177  [111] His son has been killed in the fighting, dearest of all men[112] to him, Askalaphos, whom stark Ares calls his own son.”[113] So she spoke. Then Ares struck against both his big thighs[114] with the flats of his hands, and spoke a word of anger and sorrow:[115] “Now, you who have your homes on Olympos, you must not blame me[116] for going among the ships of the Achaians, and avenging my son’s[117] slaughter, even though it be my fate to be struck by Zeus’[118] thunderbolt, and sprawl in the blood and dust by the dead men.”[119] So he spoke, and ordered Fear and Terror to harness[120] his horses, and himself got into his shining armour.[121] And there might have been wrought another anger, and bitterness[122] from Zeus, still greater, more wearisome among the immortals,[123] had not Athene, in her fear for the sake of all gods,[124] sprung up and out through the forecourt, left her chair where she was sitting,[125] and taken the helmet off from his head, the shield from his shoulders,[126] and snatched out of his heavy hand the bronze spear, and fixed it[127] apart, and then in speech reasoned with violent Ares:[128] “Madman, mazed of your wits, this is ruin! Your ears can listen[129] still to reality, but your mind is gone and your discipline.[130] Do you not hear what the goddess Hera of the white arms tells us,[131] and she coming back even now from Zeus of Olympos?[132] Do you wish, after running the course of many misfortunes[133] yourself, still to come back to Olympos under compulsion[134] though reluctant, and plant seed of great sorrow among the rest of us?[135] Since he will at once leave the Achaians and the high-hearted[136] Trojans, and come back to batter us on Olympos[137] and will catch up as they come the guilty one and the guiltless.[138] Therefore I ask of you to give up your anger for your son.[139] By now some other, better of his strength and hands than your son was,[140] has been killed, or will soon be killed; and it is a hard thing[141] to rescue all the generation and seed of all mortals.”[142] So she spoke, and seated on a chair violent Ares.[143] But Hera called to come with her outside the house Apollo[144] and Iris, who is messenger among the immortal[145] gods, and spoke to them and addressed them in winged words: “Zeus wishes[146] both of you to go to him with all speed, at Ida;[147] but when you have come there and looked upon Zeus’ countenance,[148] then you must do whatever he urges you, and his orders.”[149] So the lady Hera spoke, and once more returning[150] sat on her throne. They in a flash of speed winged their way onward.[151] They came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,[152] and found the wide-browed son of Kronos on the height of Gargaron,[153] sitting still, and fragrant cloud gathered in a circle about him.[154] These two came into the presence of Zeus the cloud-gatherer[155] and stood, nor was his heart angry when he looked upon them,[156] seeing they had promptly obeyed the message of his dear lady.[157] He spoke to Iris first of the two, and addressed her in winged words:[158] “Go on your way now, swift Iris, to the lord Poseidon,[159] and give him all this message nor be a false messenger. Tell him[160] that he must now quit the war and the fighting, and go back[161] among the generations of gods, or into the bright sea.  p 178  [162] And if he will not obey my words, or thinks nothing of them,[163] then let him consider in his heart and his spirit[164] that he might not, strong though he is, be able to stand up[165] to my attack; since I say I am far greater than he is[166] in strength, and elder born; yet his inward heart shrinks not from calling[167] himself the equal of me, though others shudder before me.”[168] He spoke, and swift wind-footed Iris did not disobey him[169] but went down along the hills of Ida to sacred Ilion.[170] As those times when out of the clouds the snow or the hail whirls[171] cold beneath the blast of the north wind born in the bright air,[172] so rapidly in her eagerness winged Iris, the swift one,[173] and stood beside the famed shaker of the earth, and spoke to him:[174] “I have a certain message for you, dark-haired, earth-encircler,[175] and came here to bring it to you from Zeus of the aegis.[176] His order is that you quit the war and the fighting, and go back[177] among the generations of gods, or into the bright sea.[178] And if you will not obey his words, or think nothing of them,[179] his threat is that he himself will come to fight with you[180] here, strength against strength, but warns you to keep from under[181] his hands, since he says he is far greater than you are[182] in strength, and elder born. Yet your inward heart shrinks not from calling[183] yourself the equal of him, though others shudder before him.”[184] Then deeply vexed the famed shaker of the earth spoke to her:[185] “No, no. Great though he is, this that he has said is too much,[186] if he will force me against my will, me, who am his equal[187] in rank. Since we are three brothers born by Rheia to Kronos,[188] Zeus, and I, and the third is Hades, lord of the dead men.[189] All was divided among us three ways, each given his domain.[190] I when the lots were shaken drew the grey sea to live in[191] forever; Hades drew the lot of the mists and the darkness,[192] and Zeus was allotted the wide sky, in the cloud and the bright air.[193] But earth and high Olympos are common to all three. Therefore[194] I am no part of the mind of Zeus. Let him in tranquillity[195] and powerful as he is stay satisfied with his third share.[196] And let him absolutely stop frightening me, as if I were[197] mean, with his hands. It were better to keep for the sons and the daughters[198] he got himself these blusterings and these threats of terror.[199] They will listen, because they must, to whatever he tells them.”[200] Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris answered him:[201] “Am I then to carry, o dark-haired, earth-encircler,[202] this word, which is strong and steep, back to Zeus from you?[203] Or will you change a little? The hearts of the great can be changed.[204] You know the Furies, how they forever side with the elder.”[205] Then in turn the shaker of the earth Poseidon spoke to her:[206] “Now this, divine Iris, was a word quite properly spoken.[207] It is a fine thing when a messenger is conscious of justice.[208] But this thing comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit,[209] when Zeus tries in words of anger to reprimand one who[210] is his equal in station, and endowed with destiny like his.[211] Still, this time I will give way, for all my vexation.[212] But I will say this also, and make it a threat in my anger.[213] If ever, acting apart from me and Athene the spoiler,  p 179  [214] apart from Hera and Hermes and the lord Hephaistos,[215] he shall spare headlong Ilion, and shall not be willing[216] to take it by storm, and bestow great victory on the Argives,[217] let him be sure, there will be no more healing of our anger.”[218] The shaker of the earth spoke, and left the Achaian people,[219] and went, merging in the sea, and the fighting Achaians longed for him.[220] After this Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to Apollo:[221] “Go now, beloved Phoibos, to the side of brazen-helmed Hektor,[222] since by this he who encircles the earth and shakes it[223] is gone into the bright sea and has avoided the anger[224] that would be ours. In truth, this would have been a fight those other[225] gods would have heard about, who gather to Kronos beneath us.[226] Now this way it was far better for me, and for himself[227] also, that, for all his vexation before, he gave way[228] to my hands. We would have sweated before this business was finished.[229] Now yourself take up in your hands the aegis with fluttering[230] tassels, and shake it hard to scare the Achaian fighters.[231] Then, striker from afar, let your own concern be glorious Hektor.[232] So long waken the huge strength in him, until the Achaians[233] run in flight, and come to the ships and the crossing of Helle.[234] From there on I myself shall think of the word and the action[235] to make the Achaians get wind once more, after their hard fighting.”[236] He spoke so, and Apollo, not disregarding his father,[237] came down along the mountains of Ida in the likeness of a rapid[238] hawk, the dove’s murderer and swiftest of all things flying.[239] He found brilliant Hektor, the son of wise Priam, sitting[240] now, no longer sprawled, as he gathered new strength back into him[241] and recognized his companions about him. The sweat and hard breathing[242] had begun to stop, once the will in Zeus of the aegis wakened him.[243] Apollo who works from afar stood beside him, and spoke to him:[244] “Hektor, son of Priam, why do you sit in such weakness[245] here apart from the others? Did some disaster befall you?”[246] In his weakness Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him:[247] “Who are you, who speak to me face to face, o noblest[248] of gods? Did you not know how by the Achaians’ grounded[249] ships, Aias of the great war cry struck me in the chest with a boulder[250] as I slaughtered his companions, and stayed my furious valour?[251] Truly, I thought that on this day I would come to the corpses[252] and the house of the death god, once I had breathed the inward life from me.”[253] In turn the lord, the worker from afar, Apollo, spoke to him:[254] “Take heart; such an avenger am I whom the son of Kronos[255] sent down from Ida, to stand by your side and defend you,[256] Phoibos Apollo of the golden sword, who in time before this[257] also have stood to defend yourself and your sheer citadel.[258] So come now, and urge on your cavalry in their numbers[259] to drive on their horses against the hollow ships. Meanwhile[260] I shall move on before you and make all the way for the horses[261] smooth before them, and bend back the Achaian fighters.”[262] He spoke, and breathed huge strength into the shepherd of the people.[263] As when some stalled horse who has been corn-fed at the manger[264] breaking free of his rope gallops over the plain in thunder  p 180  [265] to his accustomed bathing place in a sweet-running river[266] and in the pride of his strength holds high his head and the mane floats[267] over his shoulders; sure of his glorious strength, the quick knees[268] carry him to the loved places and the pasture of horses;[269] so Hektor moving rapidly his feet and his knees went[270] onward, stirring the horsemen when he heard the god’s voice speak.[271] And as when men who live in the wilds and their dogs have driven[272] into flight a horned stag or a wild goat. Inaccessible[273] the rocky cliff or the shadowed forest has covered the quarry[274] so that the men know it was not their fortune to take him;[275] and now by their clamouring shows in the way a great bearded[276] lion, and bends them to sudden flight for all their eagerness;[277] so the Danaans until that time kept always in close chase[278] assembled, stabbing at them with swords and leaf-headed spears,[279] but when they saw Hektor once more ranging the men’s ranks[280] they were frightened, and by their feet collapsed all their bravery.[281] Now Thoas spoke forth among them, the son of Andraimon,[282] far the best of the Aitolians, one skilled in the spear’s throw[283] and brave in close fight. In assembly few of the Achaians[284] when the young men contended in debate could outdo him.[285] He in kind intention now spoke forth and addressed them:[286] “Can this be? Here is a strange thing I see with my own eyes,[287] how this Hektor has got to his feet once more, and eluded[288] the death spirits. I think in each of us the heart had high hope[289] he was killed under the hands of Telamonian Aias.[290] Now some one of the gods has come to his help and rescued[291] Hektor, who has unstrung the knees of so many Danaans.[292] I think he will do it once more now. It is not without Zeus[293] the deep-thundering that he stands their champion in all this fury.[294] Come then, let us do as I say, let us all be persuaded.[295] Let us tell the multitude to make its way back toward the vessels[296] while we ourselves, who claim we are greatest in all the army,[297] stand, and see if we can face him first, and hold him off from them[298] with spears lifted against him, and I think for all of his fury[299] his heart will be afraid to plunge into our Danaan company.”[300] So he spoke, and they listened to him with care, and obeyed him.[301] They who rallied about Aias, the lord Idomeneus,[302] Teukros, Meriones, and Meges, a man like the war god,[303] closed their order for hard impact, calling on the bravest[304] to face Hektor and the Trojans. Meanwhile behind them[305] the multitude made their way back toward the ships of the Achaians.[306] The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them[307] in long strides, and in front of him went Phoibos Apollo[308] wearing a mist about his shoulders, and held the tempestuous[309] terrible aegis, shaggy, conspicuous, that the bronze-smith[310] Hephaistos had given Zeus to wear to the terror of mortals.[311] Gripping this in both hands he led on the Trojan people.[312] But the Argives stood in close order against them, and the battle cry rose up[313] in a thin scream from either side, the arrows from the bowstrings[314] jumping, while from violent hands the numerous thrown spears[315] were driven, some deep in the bodies of quick-stirring young men,  p 181  [316] while many in the space between before they had got to the white skin[317] stood fast in the ground, though they had been straining to reach the bodies.[318] So long as Phoibos Apollo held stilled in his hands the aegis,[319] so long the thrown weapons of both took hold, and men dropped under them.[320] But when he stared straight into the eyes of the fast-mounted Danaans[321] and shook the aegis, and himself gave a great baying cry, the spirit[322] inside them was mazed to hear it, they forgot their furious valour.[323] And they, as when in the dim of the black night two wild beasts[324] stampede a herd of cattle or big flock of sheep, falling[325] suddenly upon them, when no herdsman is by, the Achaians[326] fled so in their weakness and terror, since Apollo drove[327] terror upon them, and gave the glory to the Trojans and Hektor.[328] There man killed man all along the scattered encounter.[329] Hektor first killed Stichios and Arkesilaos,[330] one the leader of the bronze-armoured Boiotians, the other[331] trusted companion in arms of great-hearted Menestheus.[332] But Aineias slaughtered Medon and Iasos. Of these[333] Medon was a bastard son of godlike Oïleus[334] and therefore brother of Aias, but had made his home in Phylake[335] away from the land of his fathers, having killed a man, a relation[336] of Eriopis, his stepmother, the wife of Oïleus.[337] Iasos was a leader appointed of the Athenians,[338] and was called the son of Sphelos, the son of Boukolos.[339] Poulydamas killed Mekisteus, and Polites Echios[340] in the first onfall, and brilliant Agenor cut down Klonios.[341] Paris struck Deïochos from behind at the shoulder’s[342] base, as he ran away through the front ranks, and drove the bronze clean through.[343] While these stripped the armour from their men, meanwhile the Achaians[344] blundering about the deep-dug ditch and the sharp stakes[345] ran this way and that in terror, forced into their rampart.[346] But Hektor called aloud in a piercing cry to the Trojans:[347] “Make hard for the ships, let the bloody spoils be. That man[348] I see in the other direction apart from the vessels,[349] I will take care that he gets his death, and that man’s relations[350] neither men nor women shall give his dead body the rite of burning.[351] In the space before our city the dogs shall tear him to pieces.”[352] So speaking with a whipstroke from the shoulder he lashed on his horses[353] calling across the ranks to the Trojans, who along with him[354] all cried aloud as they steered the horses who pulled their chariots,[355] with inhuman clamour and in front of them Phoibos Apollo[356] easily, kicking them with his feet, tumbled the banked edges[357] of the deep ditch into the pit between, and bridged over a pathway[358] both wide and long, about as long as the force of a spearcast[359] goes when a man has thrown it to try his strength. They streamed over[360] in massed formation, with Apollo in front of them holding[361] the tremendous aegis, and wrecked the bastions of the Achaians[362] easily, as when a little boy piles sand by the sea-shore[363] when in his innocent play he makes sand towers to amuse him[364] and then, still playing, with hands and feet ruins them and wrecks them.  p 182  [365] So you, lord Apollo, piled in confusion much hard work[366] and painful done by the Argives and drove terror among them.[367] So they reined in and stood fast again beside their ships, calling[368] aloud upon each other, and to all of the gods, uplifting[369] their hands each man of them cried out his prayers in a great voice,[370] and beyond others Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians’ watcher,[371] prayed, reaching out both arms to the starry heavens:[372] “Father Zeus, if ever in wheat-deep Argos one of us[373] burning before you the rich thigh pieces of sheep or ox prayed[374] he would come home again, and you nodded your head and assented,[375] remember this, Olympian, save us from the day without pity;[376] let not the Achaians be beaten down like this by the Trojans.”[377] So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels thundered[378] a great stroke, hearing the prayer of the old man, the son of Neleus.[379] But the Trojans, hearing the thunderstroke of Zeus of the aegis,[380] remembered even more their warcraft, and sprang on the Argives.[381] They, as when the big waves on the sea wide-wandering[382] wash across the walls of a ship underneath the leaning[383] force of the wind, which particularly piles up the big waves,[384] so the Trojans with huge clamour went over the rampart[385] and drove their horses to fight alongside the grounded vessels,[386] with leaf-headed spears, some at close quarters, others from their horses.[387] But the Achaians climbing high on their black ships fought from them[388] with long pikes that lay among the hulls for sea fighting,[389] shrouded about the heads in bronze that was soldered upon them.[390] Meanwhile Patroklos, all the time the Achaians and Trojans[391] were fighting on both sides of the wall, far away from the fast ships,[392] had sat all this time in the shelter of courtly Eurypylos[393] and had been entertaining him with words and applying[394] medicines that would mitigate the black pains to the sore wound.[395] But when he saw the Trojans were sweeping over the rampart[396] and the outcry and the noise of terror rose from the Danaans[397] Patroklos groaned aloud then and struck himself on both thighs[398] with the flats of his hands and spoke a word of lamentation:[399] “Eurypylos, much though you need me I cannot stay here[400] longer with you. This is a big fight that has arisen.[401] Now it is for your henchman to look after you, while I[402] go in haste to Achilleus, to stir him into the fighting.[403] Who knows if, with God helping, I might trouble his spirit[404] by entreaty, since the persuasion of a friend is a strong thing.”[405] As he was speaking his feet carried him away. Meanwhile[406] the Achaians stood steady against the Trojan attack, but they could not[407] beat the enemy, fewer as they were, away from their vessels,[408] nor again had the Trojans strength to break the battalions[409] of the Danaans, and force their way into the ships and the shelters.[410] But as a chalkline straightens the cutting of a ship’s timber[411] in the hands of an expert carpenter, who by Athene’s[412] inspiration is well versed in all his craft’s subtlety,[413] so the battles fought by both sides were pulled fast and even.[414] Now by the ships others fought in their various places[415] but Hektor made straight for glorious Aias. These two[416] were fighting hard for a single ship, and neither was able,  p 183  [417] Hektor to drive Aias off the ship, and set fire to it,[418] nor Aias to beat Hektor back, since the divinity[419] drove him. Shining Aias struck with the spear Kaletor,[420] Klytios’ son, in the chest as he brought fire to the vessel.[421] He fell, thunderously, and the torch dropped from his hand. Then[422] Hektor, when his eyes were aware of his cousin fallen[423] in the dust in front of the black ship, uplifting[424] his voice in a great cry called to the Trojans and Lykians:[425] “Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[426] do not anywhere in this narrow place give away from the fighting[427] but stand by the son of Klytios, do not let the Achaians[428] strip the armour from him, fallen where the ships are assembled.”[429] So he spoke, and made a cast at Aias with the shining[430] spear, but missed him and struck the son of Mastor, Lykophron,[431] henchman of Aias from Kythera who had been living[432] with him; for he had killed a man in sacred Kythera.[433] Hektor struck him in the head above the ear with the sharp bronze[434] as he stood next to Aias, so that Lykophron sprawling[435] dropped from the ship’s stern to the ground, and his strength was broken.[436] And Aias shuddered at the sight, and spoke to his brother:[437] “See, dear Teukros, our true companion, the son of Mastor,[438] is killed, who came to us from Kythera and in our household[439] was one we honoured as we honoured our beloved parents.[440] Now great-hearted Hektor has killed him. Where are your arrows[441] of sudden death, and the bow that Phoibos Apollo gave you?”[442] He spoke, and Teukros heard and came running to stand beside him[443] holding in his hand the backstrung bow and the quiver[444] to hold arrows, and let go his hard shots against the Trojans.[445] First he struck down Kleitos, the glorious son of Peisenor[446] and companion of Poulydamas, proud son of Panthoös.[447] Now Kleitos held the reins, and gave all his care to the horses,[448] driving them into that place where the most battalions were shaken,[449] for the favour of Hektor and the Trojans, but the sudden evil[450] came to him, and none for all their desire could defend him,[451] for the painful arrow was driven into his neck from behind him.[452] He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses[453] shied away, rattling the empty car; but Poulydamas[454] their master saw it at once, and ran first to the heads of the horses.[455] He gave them into the hands of Astynoös, Protiaon’s[456] son, with many orders to be watchful and hold the horses[457] close; then himself went back into the ranks of the champions.[458] But Teukros picked up another arrow for bronze-helmed[459] Hektor, and would have stopped his fighting by the ships of the Achaians[460] had he hit him during his bravery and torn the life from him;[461] but he was not hidden from the close purpose of Zeus, who was guarding[462] Hektor, and denied that glory to Telamonian Teukros;[463] who broke in the unfaulted bow the close-twisted sinew[464] as Teukros drew it against him, so the bronze-weighted arrow[465] went, as the bow dropped out of his hands, driven crazily sidewise.[466] And Teukros shuddered at the sight, and spoke to his brother:[467] “See now, how hard the divinity cuts across the intention[468] in all our battle, who struck the bow out of my hand, who has broken  p 184  [469] the fresh-twisted sinew of the bowstring I bound on[470] this morning, so it would stand the succession of springing arrows.”[471] Then in turn huge Telamonian Aias answered him:[472] “Dear brother, then let your bow and your showering arrows[473] lie, now that the god begrudging the Danaans wrecked them.[474] But take a long spear in your hands, a shield on your shoulder,[475] and close with the Trojans, and drive on the rest of your people.[476] Let them not, though they have beaten us, easily capture[477] our strong-benched ships. We must remember the frenzy of fighting.”[478] He spoke, and Teukros put away the bow in his shelter[479] and threw across his shoulders the shield of the fourfold ox-hide.[480] Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet[481] with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.[482] Then he caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,[483] and went on his way, running fast, and stood beside Aias.[484] But Hektor, when he saw how the arrows of Teukros were baffled,[485] lifted his voice in a great cry to the Trojans and Lykians:[486] “Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[487] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour[488] along the hollow ships, since I have seen with my own eyes[489] how by the hand of Zeus their bravest man’s arrows were baffled.[490] Easily seen is the strength that is given from Zeus to mortals[491] either in those into whose hands he gives the surpassing[492] glory, or those he diminishes and will not defend them[493] as now he diminishes the strength of the Argives, and helps us.[494] Fight on then by the ships together. He who among you[495] finds by spear thrown or spear thrust his death and destiny,[496] let him die. He has no dishonour when he dies defending[497] his country, for then his wife shall be saved and his children afterwards,[498] and his house and property shall not be damaged, if the Achaians[499] must go away with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers.”[500] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[501] But Aias on the other side called to his companions:[502] “Shame, you Argives; here is the time of decision, whether[503] we die, or live on still and beat back ruin from our vessels.[504] Do you expect, if our ships fall to helm-shining Hektor,[505] you will walk each of you back dryshod to the land of your fathers?[506] Do you not hear how Hektor is stirring up all his people,[507] how he is raging to set fire to our ships? He is not[508] inviting you to come to a dance. He invites you to battle.[509] For us there can be no design, no purpose, better than this one,[510] to close in and fight with the strength of our hands at close quarters.[511] Better to take in a single time our chances of dying[512] or living, than go on being squeezed in the stark encounter[513] right up against our ships, as now, by men worse than we are.”[514] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[515] There Hektor killed the son of Perimedes, Schedios,[516] lord of the men of Phokis; but Aias killed Laodamas,[517] leader of the foot-soldiers, and shining son of Antenor.[518] Then Poulydamas stripped Otos of Kyllene, companion[519] to Meges, Phyleus’ son, and a lord among the great-hearted[520] Epeians. Meges seeing it lunged at him, but Poulydamas  p 185  [521] bent down and away, so that Meges missed him. Apollo[522] would not let Panthoös’ son go down among the front fighters,[523] but Meges stabbed with the spear the middle of the chest of Kroismos.[524] He fell, thunderously, and Meges was stripping the armour[525] from his shoulders, but meanwhile Dolops lunged at him, Lampos’[526] son, a man crafty with the spear and strongest of the sons born[527] to Lampos, Laomedon’s son, one skilled in furious fighting.[528] He from close up stabbed with his spear at the shield of Phyleides[529] in the middle, but the corselet he wore defended him, solid[530] and built with curving plates of metal, which in days past Phyleus[531] had taken home from Ephyra and the river Selleëis.[532] A guest and friend had given him it, lord of men, Euphetes,[533] to carry into the fighting and beat off the attack of the enemy,[534] and now it guarded the body of his son from destruction.[535] But Meges stabbed with the sharp spear at the uttermost summit[536] of the brazen helmet thick with horse-hair, and tore off[537] the mane of horse-hair from the helmet, so that it toppled[538] groundward and lay in the dust in all its new shining of purple.[539] Yet Dolops stood his ground and fought on, in hope still of winning,[540] but meanwhile warlike Menelaos came to stand beside Meges,[541] and came from the side and unobserved with his spear, and from behind[542] threw at his shoulder, so the spear tore through his chest in its fury[543] to drive on, so that Dolops reeled and went down, face forward.[544] The two of them swept in to strip away from his shoulders[545] the bronze armour, but Hektor called aloud to his brothers,[546] the whole lot, but first scolded the son of Hiketaon,[547] strong Melanippos. He in Perkote had tended his lumbering[548] cattle, in the days before when the enemy were still far off;[549] but when the oarswept ships of the Danaans came, then[550] he returned to Ilion, and was a great man among the Trojans,[551] and lived with Priam, who honoured him as he honoured his children.[552] Now Hektor spoke a word and called him by name and scolded him:[553] “Shall we give way so, Melanippos? Does it mean nothing[554] even to you in the inward heart that your cousin is fallen?[555] Do you not see how they are busied over the armour of Dolops?[556] Come on, then; no longer can we stand far off and fight with[557] the Argives. Sooner we must kill them, or else sheer Ilion[558] be stormed utterly by them, and her citizens be killed.”[559] He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal[560] godlike. But huge Telamonian Aias stirred on the Argives:[561] “Dear friends, be men; let shame be in your hearts, and discipline,[562] and have consideration for each other in the strong encounters,[563] since more come through alive when men consider each other,[564] and there is no glory when they give way, nor warcraft either.”[565] He spoke, and they likewise grew furious in their defence,[566] and put his word away in their hearts, and fenced in their vessels[567] in a circle of bronze, but Zeus against them wakened the Trojans.[568] Then Menelaos of the great war cry stirred on Antilochos:[569] “Antilochos, no other Achaian is younger than you are,[570] nor faster on his feet, nor strong as you are in fighting.[571] You could make an outrush and strike down some man of the Trojans.”[572] So speaking, he hastened back but stirred Antilochos onward,  p 186  [573] and he sprang forth from the champions and hefted the shining javelin,[574] glaring round about him, and the Trojans gave way in the face[575] of the man throwing with the spear. And he made no vain cast[576] but struck Hiketaon’s son, Melanippos the high-hearted,[577] in the chest next to the nipple as he swept into the fighting.[578] He fell, thunderously, and darkness closed over both eyes.[579] Antilochos sprang forth against him, as a hound rushes[580] against a stricken fawn that as he broke from his covert[581] a hunter has shot at, and hit, and broken his limbs’ strength.[582] So Antilochos stubborn in battle sprang, Melanippos,[583] at you, to strip your armour, but did not escape brilliant Hektor’s[584] notice, who came on the run through the fighting against him.[585] Antilochos did not hold his ground, although a swift fighter,[586] but fled away like a wild beast who has done some bad thing,[587] one who has killed a hound or an ox-herd tending his cattle[588] and escapes, before a gang of men has assembled against him;[589] so Nestor’s son ran away, and after him the Trojans and Hektor[590] with unearthly clamour showered their groaning weapons against him.[591] He turned and stood when he got into the swarm of his own companions.[592] But the Trojans in the likeness of ravening lions swept on[593] against the ships, and were bringing to accomplishment Zeus’ orders,[594] who wakened always the huge strength in them, dazed the courage[595] of the Argives, and denied their glory, and stirred on the others.[596] Zeus’ desire was to give glory to the son of Priam,[597] Hektor, that he might throw on the curved ships the inhuman[598] weariless strength of fire, and so make completely accomplished[599] the prayer of Thetis. Therefore Zeus of the counsels waited[600] the sight before his eyes of the flare, when a single ship burned.[601] From thereon he would make the attack of the Trojans[602] surge back again from the ships, and give the Danaans glory.[603] With this in mind he drove on against the hollow ships Hektor,[604] Priam’s son, though Hektor without the god was in fury[605] and raged, as when destructive fire or spear-shaking Ares[606] rages among the mountains and dense places of the deep forest.[607] A slaver came out around his mouth, and under the lowering[608] brows his eyes were glittering, the helm on his temples[609] was shaken and thundered horribly to the fighting of Hektor.[610] Out of the bright sky Zeus himself was working to help him[611] and among men so numerous he honoured this one man[612] and glorified him, since Hektor was to have only a short life[613] and already the day of his death was being driven upon him[614] by Pallas Athene through the strength of Achilleus. And now[615] he was probing the ranks of men, and trying to smash them,[616] and made for where there were most men together, and the best armour.[617] But even so he could not break them, for all his fury,[618] for they closed into a wall and held him, like some towering[619] huge sea-cliff that lies close along the grey salt water[620] and stands up against the screaming winds and their sudden directions[621] and against the waves that grow to bigness and burst up against it.[622] So the Danaans stood steady against the Trojans, nor gave way.[623] But he, lit about with flame on all sides, charged on their numbers[624] and descended upon them as descends on a fast ship the battering  p 187  [625] wave storm-bred from beneath the clouds, and the ship goes utterly[626] hidden under the foam, and the dangerous blast of the hurricane[627] thunders against the sail, and the hearts of the seamen are shaken[628] with fear, as they are carried only a little way out of death’s reach.[629] So the heart in the breast of each Achaian was troubled.[630] Hektor came on against them, as a murderous lion on cattle[631] who in the low-lying meadow of a great marsh pasture[632] by hundreds, and among them a herdsman who does not quite know[633] how to fight a wild beast off from killing a horn-curved[634] ox, and keeps pace with the first and the last of the cattle[635] always, but the lion making his spring at the middle[636] eats an ox as the rest stampede; so now the Achaians[637] fled in unearthly terror before father Zeus and Hektor,[638] all, but he got one only, Periphetes of Mykenai,[639] beloved son of Kopreus, who for the lord Eurystheus[640] had gone often with messages to powerful Herakles.[641] To him, a meaner father, was born a son who was better[642] for all talents, in the speed of his feet and in battle[643] and for intelligence counted among the first in Mykenai.[644] Thereby now higher was the glory he granted to Hektor.[645] For as he whirled about to get back, he fell over the out-rim[646] of the shield he carried, which reached to his feet to keep the spears from him.[647] Stumbling on this he went over on his back, and the helmet[648] that circled his temples clashed horribly as he went down.[649] Hektor saw it sharply, and ran up and stood beside him,[650] and stuck the spear into his chest and killed him before the eyes[651] of his dear friends, who for all their sorrowing could do nothing[652] to help their companion, being themselves afraid of great Hektor.[653] Now they had got among the ships, and the ends were about them[654] of the ships hauled up in the first line, but the Trojans swarmed[655] on them. The Argives under force gave back from the first line[656] of their ships, but along the actual shelters they rallied[657] in a group, and did not scatter along the encampment. Shame held them[658] and fear. They kept up a continuous call to each other,[659] and beyond others Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians’ watcher,[660] supplicated each man by the knees for the sake of his parents.[661] “Dear friends, be men; let shame be in your hearts and discipline[662] in the sight of other men, and each one of you remember[663] his children and his wife, his property and his parents,[664] whether a man’s father and mother live or have died. Here now[665] I supplicate your knees for the sake of those who are absent[666] to stand strongly and not be turned to the terror of panic.”[667] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and heart in each man,[668] and from their eyes Athene pushed the darkness immortal[669] of mist, and the light came out hard against them on both sides[670] whether they looked from the ships or from the closing of battle.[671] They knew Hektor of the great war cry, they knew his companions[672] whether they stood away behind and out of the fighting[673] or whether alongside the fast ships they fought in the battle.[674] Nor did it still please great-hearted Aias to stand back[675] where the other sons of the Achaians had taken position;  p 188  [676] but he went in huge strides up and down the decks of the vessels.[677] He wielded in his hands a great pike for sea fighting,[678] twenty-two cubits long and joined together by clinchers.[679] And as a man who is an expert rider of horses[680] who when he has chosen and coupled four horses out of many[681] makes his way over the plain galloping toward a great city[682] along the travelled road, and many turn to admire him,[683] men or women, while he steadily and never slipping[684] jumps and shifts his stance from one to another as they gallop;[685] so Aias ranged crossing from deck to deck of the fast ships[686] taking huge strides, and his voice went always up to the bright sky[687] as he kept up a terrible bellow and urged on the Danaans[688] to defend their ships and their shelters, while on the other side Hektor[689] would not stay back among the mass of close-armoured Trojans,[690] but as a flashing eagle makes his plunge upon other[691] flying birds as these feed in a swarm by a river,[692] whether these be geese or cranes or swans long-throated,[693] so Hektor steered the course of his outrush straight for a vessel[694] with dark prows, and from behind Zeus was pushing him onward[695] hard with his big hand, and stirred on his people beside him.[696] Now once again a grim battle was fought by the vessels;[697] you would say that they faced each other unbruised, unwearied[698] in the fighting, from the speed in which they went for each other.[699] This was the thought in each as they struggled on: the Achaians[700] thought they could not get clear of the evil, but must perish,[701] while the heart inside each one of the Trojans was hopeful[702] to set fire to the ships and kill the fighting men of Achaia.[703] With such thoughts in mind they stood up to fight with each other.[704] Hektor caught hold of the stern of a grand, fast-running,[705] seafaring ship, that once had carried Protesilaos[706] to Troy, and did not take him back to the land of his fathers.[707] It was around his ship that now Achaians and Trojans[708] cut each other down at close quarters, nor any longer[709] had patience for the volleys exchanged from bows and javelins[710] but stood up close against each other, matching their fury,[711] and fought their battle with sharp hatchets and axes, with great[712] swords and with leaf-headed pikes, and many magnificent[713] swords were scattered along the ground, black-thonged, heavy-hilted,[714] sometimes dropping from the hands, some glancing from shoulders[715] of men as they fought, so the ground ran black with blood. Hektor[716] would not let go of the stern of a ship where he had caught hold of it[717] but gripped the sternpost in his hands and called to the Trojans:[718] “Bring fire, and give single voice to the clamour of battle.[719] Now Zeus has given us a day worth all the rest of them:[720] the ships’ capture, the ships that came here in spite of the gods’ will[721] and have visited much pain on us, by our counsellors’ cowardice[722] who would not let me fight by the grounded ships, though I wanted to,[723] but held me back in restraint, and curbed in our fighters.[724] But Zeus of the wide brows, though then he fouled our intentions,[725] comes now himself to urge us on and give us encouragement.”[726] He spoke, and they thereby came on harder against the Argives.[727] Their volleys were too much for Aias, who could hold no longer  p 189  [728] his place, but had to give back a little, expecting to die there,[729] back to the seven-foot midship, and gave up the high deck of the balanced[730] ship. There he stood and waited for them, and with his pike always[731] beat off any Trojan who carried persistent fire from the vessels.[732] He kept up a terrible bellowing, and urged on the Danaans:[733] “Friends and fighting men of the Danaans, henchmen of Ares,[734] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.[735] Do we think there are others who stand behind us to help us?[736] Have we some stronger wall that can rescue men from perdition?[737] We have no city built strong with towers lying near us, within which[738] we could defend ourselves and hold off this host that matches us.[739] We hold position in this plain of the close-armoured Trojans,[740] bent back against the sea, and far from the land of our fathers.[741] Salvation’s light is in our hands’ work, not the mercy of battle.”[742] He spoke, and came forward with his sharp spear, raging for battle.[743] And whenever some Trojan crashed against the hollow ships[744] with burning fire, who sought to wake the favour of Hektor,[745] Aias would wait for him and then stab with the long pike[746] and so from close up wounded twelve in front of the vessels.book sixteen[1] So they fought on both sides for the sake of the strong-benched vessel.[2] Meanwhile Patroklos came to the shepherd of the people, Achilleus,[3] and stood by him and wept warm tears, like a spring dark-running[4] that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water;[5] and swift-footed brilliant Achilleus looked on him in pity,[6] and spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words: “Why then[7] are you crying like some poor little girl, Patroklos,[8] who runs after her mother and begs to be picked up and carried,[9] and clings to her dress, and holds her back when she tries to hurry,[10] and gazes tearfully into her face, until she is picked up?[11] You are like such a one, Patroklos, dropping these soft tears.[12] Could you have some news to tell, for me or the Myrmidons?[13] Have you, and nobody else, received some message from Phthia?[14] Yet they tell me Aktor’s son Menoitios lives still[15] and Aiakos’ son Peleus lives still among the Myrmidons.[16] If either of these died we should take it hard. Or is it[17] the Argives you are mourning over, and how they are dying[18] against the hollow ships by reason of their own arrogance?[19] Tell me, do not hide it in your mind, and so we shall both know.”[20] Then groaning heavily, Patroklos the rider, you answered:[21] “Son of Peleus, far greatest of the Achaians, Achilleus,[22] do not be angry; such grief has fallen upon the Achaians.[23] For all those who were before the bravest in battle[24] are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds.[25] The son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes, was hit by an arrow,[26] and Odysseus has a pike wound, and Agamemnon the spear-famed,[27] and Eurypylos has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow.[28] And over these the healers skilled in medicine are working[29] to cure their wounds. But you, Achilleus; who can do anything  p 190  [30] with you? May no such anger take me as this that you cherish![31] Cursed courage. What other man born hereafter shall be advantaged[32] unless you beat aside from the Argives this shameful destruction?[33] Pitiless: the rider Peleus was never your father[34] nor Thetis was your mother, but it was the grey sea that bore you[35] and the towering rocks, so sheer the heart in you is turned from us.[36] But if you are drawing back from some prophecy known in your own heart[37] and by Zeus’ will your honoured mother has told you of something,[38] then send me out at least, let the rest of the Myrmidon people[39] follow me, and I may be a light given to the Danaans.[40] Give me your armour to wear on my shoulders into the fighting;[41] so perhaps the Trojans might think I am you, and give way[42] from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind[43] again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.[44] We unwearied might with a mere cry pile men wearied[45] back upon their city, and away from the ships and the shelters.”[46] So he spoke supplicating in his great innocence; this was[47] his own death and evil destruction he was entreating.[48] But now, deeply troubled, swift-footed Achilleus answered him:[49] “Ah, Patroklos, illustrious, what is this you are saying?[50] I have not any prophecy in mind that I know of;[51] there is no word from Zeus my honoured mother has told me,[52] but this thought comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit[53] when a man tries to foul one who is his equal, to take back[54] a prize of honour, because he goes in greater authority.[55] This is a bitter thought to me; my desire has been dealt with[56] roughly. The girl the sons of the Achaians chose out for my honour,[57] and I won her with my own spear, and stormed a strong-fenced city,[58] is taken back out of my hands by powerful Agamemnon,[59] the son of Atreus, as if I were some dishonoured vagabond.[60] Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past; and it was not[61] in my heart to be angry forever; and yet I have said[62] I would not give over my anger until that time came[63] when the fighting with all its clamour came up to my own ships.[64] So do you draw my glorious armour about your shoulders;[65] lead the Myrmidons whose delight is battle into the fighting,[66] if truly the black cloud of the Trojans has taken position[67] strongly about our ships, and the others, the Argives, are bent back[68] against the beach of the sea, holding only a narrow division[69] of land, and the whole city of the Trojans has descended upon them[70] boldly; because they do not see the face of my helmet[71] glaring close; or else they would run and cram full of dead men[72] the water-courses; if powerful Agamemnon treated me[73] kindly. Now the Argives fight for their very encampment.[74] For the spear rages not now in the hands of the son of Tydeus,[75] Diomedes, to beat destruction aside from the Danaans,[76] nor have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus crying[77] from his hated head; no, but the voice of murderous Hektor[78] calling to the Trojans crashes about my ears; with their war cry[79] they hold the entire plain as they beat the Achaians in battle.[80] But even so, Patroklos, beat the bane aside from our ships; fall[81] upon them with all your strength; let them not with fire’s blazing  p 191  [82] inflame our ships, and take away our desired homecoming.[83] But obey to the end this word I put upon your attention[84] so that you can win, for me, great honour and glory[85] in the sight of all the Danaans, so they will bring back to me[86] the lovely girl, and give me shining gifts in addition.[87] When you have driven them from the ships, come back; although later[88] the thunderous lord of Hera might grant you the winning of glory,[89] you must not set your mind on fighting the Trojans, whose delight[90] is in battle, without me. So you will diminish my honour.[91] You must not, in the pride and fury of fighting, go on[92] slaughtering the Trojans, and lead the way against Ilion,[93] for fear some one of the everlasting gods on Olympos[94] might crush you. Apollo who works from afar loves these people[95] dearly. You must turn back once you bring the light of salvation[96] to the ships, and let the others go on fighting in the flat land.[97] Father Zeus, Athene and Apollo, if only[98] not one of all the Trojans could escape destruction, not one[99] of the Argives, but you and I could emerge from the slaughter[100] so that we two alone could break Troy’s hallowed coronal.”[101] Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile[102] the volleys were too much for Aias, who could hold no longer[103] his place. The will of Zeus beat him back, and the proud Trojans[104] with their spears, and around his temples the shining helmet[105] clashed horribly under the shower of strokes; he was hit constantly[106] on the strong-wrought cheek-pieces, and his left shoulder was tiring[107] from always holding up the big glittering shield; yet they could not[108] beat him out of his place, though they piled their missiles upon him.[109] His breath came ever hard and painful, the sweat ran pouring[110] down his body from every limb, he could find no means[111] to catch his breath, but evil was piled on evil about him.[112] Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,[113] how fire was first thrown upon the ships of the Achaians.[114] Hektor stood up close to Aias and hacked at the ash spear[115] with his great sword, striking behind the socket of the spearhead,[116] and slashed it clean away, so that Telamonian Aias[117] shook there in his hand a lopped spear, while far away from him[118] the bronze spearhead fell echoing to the ground; and Aias[119] knew in his blameless heart, and shivered for knowing it, how this[120] was gods’ work, how Zeus high-thundering cut across the intention[121] in all his battle, how he planned that the Trojans should conquer.[122] He drew away out of the missiles, and the Trojans threw weariless fire[123] on the fast ship, and suddenly the quenchless flame streamed over it.[124] So the fire was at work on the ship’s stern; but Achilleus[125] struck his hands against both his thighs, and called to Patroklos:[126] “Rise up, illustrious Patroklos, rider of horses.[127] I see how the ravening fire goes roaring over our vessels.[128] They must not get our ships so we cannot run away in them.[129] Get on your armour; faster; I will muster our people.”[130] He spoke, and Patroklos was helming himself in bronze that glittered.[131] First he placed along his legs the beautiful greaves, linked[132] with silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.[133] Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet  p 192  [134] starry and elaborate of swift-footed Aiakides.[135] Across his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver,[136] a bronze sword, and above it the great shield, huge and heavy.[137] Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet[138] with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.[139] He took up two powerful spears that fitted his hand’s grip,[140] only he did not take the spear of blameless Aiakides,[141] huge, heavy, thick, which no one else of all the Achaians[142] could handle, but Achilleus alone knew how to wield it;[143] the Pelian ash spear which Cheiron had brought to his father[144] from high on Pelion to be death for fighters. Patroklos[145] ordered Automedon rapidly to harness the horses,[146] a man he honoured most, after Achilleus breaker of battles,[147] who stood most staunchly by him against the fury of fighting.[148] For him Automedon led the fast-running horses under[149] the yoke, Xanthos and Balios, who tore with the winds’ speed,[150] horses stormy Podarge once conceived of the west wind[151] and bore, as she grazed in the meadow beside the swirl of the Ocean.[152] In the traces beside these he put unfaulted Pedasos[153] whom Achilleus brought back once when he stormed Eëtion’s city.[154] He, mortal as he was, ran beside the immortal horses.[155] But Achilleus went meanwhile to the Myrmidons, and arrayed them[156] all in their war gear along the shelters. And they, as wolves[157] who tear flesh raw, in whose hearts the battle fury is tireless,[158] who have brought down a great horned stag in the mountains, and then feed[159] on him, till the jowls of every wolf run blood, and then go[160] all in a pack to drink from a spring of dark-running water,[161] lapping with their lean tongues along the black edge of the surface[162] and belching up the clotted blood; in the heart of each one[163] is a spirit untremulous, but their bellies are full and groaning;[164] as such the lords of the Myrmidons and their men of counsel[165] around the brave henchman of swift-footed Aiakides[166] swarmed, and among them was standing warlike Achilleus[167] and urged on the fighting men with their shields, and the horses.[168] Fifty were the fast-running ships wherein Achilleus[169] beloved of Zeus had led his men to Troy, and in each one[170] were fifty men, his companions in arms, at the rowing benches.[171] He had made five leaders among them, and to these entrusted[172] the command, while he in his great power was lord over all of them.[173] One battalion was led by Menesthios of the shining[174] corselet, son of Spercheios, the river swelled from the bright sky,[175] born of the daughter of Peleus, Polydore the lovely,[176] to unremitting Spercheios, when a woman lay with an immortal;[177] but born in name to Perieres’ son, Boros, who married[178] Polydore formally, and gave gifts beyond count to win her.[179] The next battalion was led by warlike Eudoros, a maiden’s[180] child, born to one lovely in the dance, Polymele,[181] daughter of Phylas; whom strong Hermes Argeïphontes[182] loved, when he watched her with his eyes among the girls dancing[183] in the choir for clamorous Artemis of the golden distaff.[184] Presently Hermes the healer went up with her into her chamber[185] and lay secretly with her, and she bore him a son, the shining  p 193  [186] Eudoros, a surpassing runner and a quick man in battle.[187] But after Eileithyia of the hard pains had brought out[188] the child into the light, and he looked on the sun’s shining,[189] Aktor’s son Echekles in the majesty of his great power[190] led her to his house, when he had given numberless gifts to win her,[191] and the old man Phylas took the child and brought him up kindly[192] and cared for him, in affection as if he had been his own son.[193] The leader of the third battalion was warlike Peisandros,[194] Maimalos’ son, who outshone all the rest of the Myrmidons[195] in spear-fighting, next to Peleian Achilleus’ henchman.[196] The fourth battalion was led by Phoinix, the aged horseman,[197] the fifth by Alkimedon, the blameless son of Laerkes.[198] But after Achilleus gave them their stations all in good order[199] beside their leaders, he laid his stern injunction upon them:[200] “Myrmidons: not one of you can forget those mutterings,[201] those threats that beside the running ships you made at the Trojans[202] in all the time of my anger, and it was I you were blaming,[203] as: ‘Hard son of Peleus! Your mother nursed you on gall. You have no[204] pity, to keep your companions here by the ships unwilling.[205] We should go back home again, then, in our seafaring vessels[206] now that this wretched anger has befallen your spirit.’[207] Often you would gather in groups and so mutter against me,[208] and now is shown a great work of that fighting you longed for.[209] Then let each man take heart of strength to fight with the Trojans.”[210] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man,[211] and their ranks, as they listened to the king, pulled closer together.[212] And as a man builds solid a wall with stones set close together[213] for the rampart of a high house keeping out the force of the winds, so[214] close together were the helms and shields massive in the middle.[215] For shield leaned on shield, helmet on helmet, man against man,[216] and the horse-hair crests along the horns of the shining helmets[217] touched as they bent their heads, so dense were they formed on each other.[218] And before them all were two men in their armour, Patroklos[219] and Automedon, both of them in one single fury[220] to fight in front of the Myrmidons. But meanwhile Achilleus[221] went off into his shelter, and lifted the lid from a lovely[222] elaborately wrought chest, which Thetis the silver-footed[223] had put in his ship to carry, and filled it fairly with tunics[224] and mantles to hold the wind from a man, and with fleecy blankets.[225] Inside this lay a wrought goblet, nor did any other[226] man drink the shining wine from it nor did Achilleus[227] pour from it to any other god, but only Zeus father.[228] He took this now out of the chest, and cleaned it with sulphur[229] first, and afterwards washed it out in bright-running water,[230] and washed his own hands, and poured shining wine into the goblet[231] and stood in his middle forecourt and prayed, and poured the wine, looking[232] into the sky, not unseen by Zeus who delights in the thunder:[233] “High Zeus, lord of Dodona, Pelasgian, living afar off,[234] brooding over wintry Dodona, your prophets about you[235] living, the Selloi who sleep on the ground with feet unwashed. Hear me.[236] As one time before when I prayed to you, you listened[237] and did me honour, and smote strongly the host of the Achaians,  p 194  [238] so one more time bring to pass the wish that I pray for.[239] For see, I myself am staying where the ships are assembled,[240] but I send out my companion and many Myrmidons with him[241] to fight. Let glory, Zeus of the wide brows, go forth with him.[242] Make brave the heart inside his breast, so that even Hektor[243] will find out whether our henchman knows how to fight his battles[244] by himself, or whether his hands rage invincible only[245] those times when I myself go into the grind of the war god.[246] But when he has beaten back from the ships their clamorous onset,[247] then let him come back to me and the running ships, unwounded,[248] with all his armour and with the companions who fight close beside him.”[249] So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels heard him.[250] The father granted him one prayer, and denied him the other.[251] That Patroklos should beat back the fighting assault on the vessels[252] he allowed, but refused to let him come back safe out of the fighting.[253] When Achilleus had poured the wine and prayed to Zeus father[254] he went back into the shelter, stowed the cup in the chest, and came out[255] to stand in front of the door, with the desire in his heart still[256] to watch the grim encounter of Achaians and Trojans.[257] Now they who were armed in the company of great-hearted Patroklos[258] went onward, until in high confidence they charged on the Trojans.[259] The Myrmidons came streaming out like wasps at the wayside[260] when little boys have got into the habit of making them angry[261] by always teasing them as they live in their house by the roadside;[262] silly boys, they do something that hurts many people;[263] and if some man who travels on the road happens to pass them[264] and stirs them unintentionally, they in heart of fury[265] come swarming out each one from his place to fight for their children.[266] In heart and in fury like these the Myrmidons streaming[267] came out from their ships, with a tireless clamour arising,[268] and Patroklos called afar in a great voice to his companions:[269] “Myrmidons, companions of Peleus’ son, Achilleus,[270] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour;[271] we must bring honour to Peleus’ son, far the greatest of the Argives[272] by the ships, we, even the henchmen who fight beside him,[273] so Atreus’ son wide-ruling Agamemnon may recognize[274] his madness, that he did no honour to the best of the Achaians.”[275] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.[276] They fell upon the Trojans in a pack, and about them[277] the ships echoed terribly to the roaring Achaians.[278] But the Trojans, when they saw the powerful son of Menoitios[279] himself and his henchman with him in the glare of their war gear,[280] the heart was stirred in all of them, the battalions were shaken[281] in the expectation that by the ships swift-footed Peleion[282] had thrown away his anger and chosen the way of friendship.[283] Then each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.[284] Patroklos was the first man to make a cast with the shining[285] spear, straight through the middle fighting, where most men were stricken,[286] beside the stern on the ship of great-hearted Protesilaos,[287] and struck Pyraichmes, who had led the lords of Paionian[288] horses from Amydon and the wide waters of Axios.[289] He struck him in the right shoulder, so he dropped in the dust groaning,  p 195  [290] on his back, and his Paionian companions about him[291] scattered; for Patroklos drove the fear into all of them[292] when he cut down their leader, the best of them all in battle.[293] He drove them from the ships and put out the fire that was blazing,[294] and that ship was left half-burnt as it was, as the Trojans scattered[295] in terror and unearthly noise, and the Danaans streamed back[296] along the hollow ships, and clamour incessant rose up.[297] And as when from the towering height of a great mountain Zeus[298] who gathers the thunderflash stirs the cloud dense upon it,[299] and all the high places of the hills are clear and the shoulders out-jutting[300] and the deep ravines, as endless bright air spills from the heavens,[301] so when the Danaans had beaten from their ships the ravening[302] fire, they got breath for a little, but there was no check in the fighting;[303] for the Trojans under the attack of the warlike Achaians[304] had not yet turned their faces to run away from the black ships.[305] They stood yet against them, but gave way from the ships under pressure.[306] There man killed man all along the scattered encounter[307] of the leaders, and first among them, the strong son of Menoitios,[308] threw and struck Areïlykos in the thigh, as he turned[309] back, with the sharp point of the spear, and drove the bronze clean through.[310] The spear smashed in the bone and he fell to the ground headlong[311] on his face. Meanwhile warlike Menelaos stabbed Thoas[312] in the chest where it was left bare by the shield, and unstrung his limbs’ strength.[313] Meges, Phyleus’ son, watched Amphiklos as he came on[314] and was too quick with a stab at the base of the leg, where the muscle[315] of a man grows thickest, so that on the spearhead the sinew[316] was torn apart, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.[317] Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilochos, stabbed Atymnios[318] with the sharp spear, and drove the bronze head clean through his flank, so[319] that he fell forward; but Maris with the spear from close up[320] made a lunge at Antilochos in rage for his brother[321] standing in front of the corpse, but before him godlike Thrasymedes[322] was in with a thrust before he could stab, nor missed his quick stroke[323] into the shoulder, and the spearhead shore off the arm’s base[324] clear away from the muscles and torn from the bone utterly.[325] He fell, thunderously, and darkness closed over both eyes.[326] So these two, beaten down under the hands of two brothers,[327] descended to the dark place, Sarpedon’s noble companions[328] and spear-throwing sons of Amisodaros, the one who had nourished[329] the furious Chimaira to be an evil to many.[330] Aias, Oïleus’ son, in an outrush caught Kleoboulos[331] alive, where he was fouled in the running confusion, and there[332] unstrung his strength, hewing with the hilted sword at the neck,[333] so all the sword was smoking with blood and over both eyes[334] closed the red death and the strong destiny. Then Peneleos[335] and Lykon ran up close together, since these with their spear-throws[336] had gone wide of each other, and each had made a cast vainly.[337] So now the two of them ran together with swords. There Lykon[338] hacked at the horn of the horse-hair crested helm, but the sword blade[339] broke at the socket; Peneleos cut at the neck underneath[340] the ear, and the sword sank clean inside, with only skin left  p 196  [341] to hold it, and the head slumped aside, and the limbs were loosened.[342] Meriones on his light feet overtaking Akamas[343] stabbed him in the right shoulder as he climbed up behind his horses[344] and the darkness drifted over his eyes as he crashed from the chariot.[345] Idomeneus stabbed Erymas in the mouth with the pitiless[346] bronze, so that the brazen spearhead smashed its way clean through[347] below the brain in an upward stroke, and the white bones splintered,[348] and the teeth were shaken out with the stroke and both eyes filled up[349] with blood, and gaping he blew a spray of blood through the nostrils[350] and through his mouth, and death in a dark mist closed in about him.[351] So these lords of the Danaans killed each his own man.[352] They as wolves make havoc among lambs or young goats in their fury,[353] catching them out of the flocks, when the sheep separate in the mountains[354] through the thoughtlessness of the shepherd, and the wolves seeing them[355] suddenly snatch them away, and they have no heart for fighting;[356] so the Danaans ravaged the Trojans, and these remembered[357] the bitter sound of terror, and forgot their furious valour.[358] But the great Aias was trying forever to make a spearcast[359] at bronze-helmed Hektor, but he in his experience of fighting[360] with his broad shoulders huddled under the bull’s-hide shield kept[361] watching always the whistle of arrows, the crash of spears thrown.[362] He knew well how the strength of the fighting shifted against him,[363] but even so stood his ground to save his steadfast companions.[364] As when a cloud goes deep into the sky from Olympos[365] through the bright upper air when Zeus brings on the hurricane,[366] so rose from beside the ships their outcry, the noise of their terror.[367] In no good order they went back, while his fast-running horses[368] carried Hektor away in his armour; he abandoned the people[369] of the Trojans, who were trapped by the deep-dug ditch unwilling,[370] and in the ditch many fast horses who pulled the chariots[371] left, broken short at the joining of the pole, their masters’ chariots[372] while Patroklos was on them, calling hard and loud to the Danaans[373] with evil intention for the Trojans, who, in clamorous terror,[374] choked all the ways where they were cut off; from under their feet stirred[375] the dust-storm scattered in clouds, their single-foot horses were straining[376] to get back to the city away from the ships and the shelters.[377] But Patroklos, where he saw the stirring of most people,[378] steered there, shouting, and men went down under the axles[379] headlong from chariots as the empty cars rattled onward.[380] Straight across the ditch overleapt those swift and immortal[381] horses the gods had given as shining gifts to Peleus,[382] hurtling onward, as Patroklos’ rage stirred him against Hektor,[383] whom he tried to strike, but his fast horses carried him out of it.[384] As underneath the hurricane all the black earth is burdened[385] on an autumn day, when Zeus sends down the most violent waters[386] in deep rage against mortals after they stir him to anger[387] because in violent assembly they pass decrees that are crooked,[388] and drive righteousness from among them and care nothing for what the gods think,[389] and all the rivers of these men swell current to full spate[390] and in the ravines of their water-courses rip all the hillsides[391] and dash whirling in huge noise down to the blue sea, out of  p 197  [392] the mountains headlong, so that the works of men are diminished;[393] so huge rose the noise from the horses of Troy in their running.[394] But Patroklos, when he had cut away their first battalions,[395] turned back to pin them against the ships, and would not allow them[396] to climb back into their city though they strained for it, but sweeping[397] through the space between the ships, the high wall, and the river,[398] made havoc and exacted from them the blood price for many.[399] There first of all he struck with the shining spear Pronoös[400] in the chest where it was left bare by the shield, and unstrung his limbs’ strength.[401] He fell, thunderously, and Patroklos in his next outrush[402] at Thestor, Enops’ son, who huddled inside his chariot,[403] shrunk back, he had lost all his nerve, and from his hands the reins[404] slipped—Patroklos coming close up to him stabbed with a spear-thrust[405] at the right side of the jaw and drove it on through the teeth, then[406] hooked and dragged him with the spear over the rail, as a fisherman[407] who sits out on the jut of a rock with line and glittering[408] bronze hook drags a fish, who is thus doomed, out of the water.[409] So he hauled him, mouth open to the bright spear, out of the chariot,[410] and shoved him over on his face, and as he fell the life left him.[411] Next he struck Erylaos, as he swept in, with a great stone[412] in the middle of the head, and all the head broke into two pieces[413] inside the heavy helmet, and he in the dust face downward[414] dropped while death breaking the spirit drifted about him.[415] Afterwards with Erymas, Amphoteros, and Epaltes,[416] Tlepolemos Damastor’s son, Echios and Pyris,[417] Ipheus and Euippos, and Argeas’ son Polymelos,[418] all these he felled to the bountiful earth in rapid succession.[419] But Sarpedon, when he saw his free-girt companions going[420] down underneath the hands of Menoitios’ son Patroklos,[421] called aloud in entreaty upon the godlike Lykians:[422] “Shame, you Lykians, where are you running to? You must be fierce now,[423] for I myself will encounter this man, so I may find out[424] who this is who has so much strength and has done so much evil[425] to the Trojans, since many and brave are those whose knees he has unstrung.”[426] He spoke, and sprang to the ground in all his arms from the chariot,[427] and on the other side Patroklos when he saw him leapt down[428] from his chariot. They as two hook-clawed beak-bent vultures[429] above a tall rock face, high-screaming, go for each other,[430] so now these two, crying aloud, encountered together.[431] And watching them the son of devious-devising Kronos[432] was pitiful, and spoke to Hera, his wife and his sister:[433] “Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,[434] must go down under the hands of Menoitios’ son Patroklos.[435] The heart in my breast is balanced between two ways as I ponder,[436] whether I should snatch him out of the sorrowful battle[437] and set him down still alive in the rich country of Lykia,[438] or beat him under at the hands of the son of Menoitios.”[439] In turn the lady Hera of the ox eyes answered him:[440] “Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[441] Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since  p 198  [442] doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?[443] Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.[444] And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you;[445] if you bring Sarpedon back to his home, still living,[446] think how then some other one of the gods might also[447] wish to carry his own son out of the strong encounter;[448] since around the great city of Priam are fighting many[449] sons of the immortals. You will waken grim resentment among them.[450] No, but if he is dear to you, and your heart mourns for him,[451] then let him be, and let him go down in the strong encounter[452] underneath the hands of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios;[453] but after the soul and the years of his life have left him, then send[454] Death to carry him away, and Sleep, who is painless,[455] until they come with him to the countryside of broad Lykia[456] where his brothers and countrymen shall give him due burial[457] with tomb and gravestone. Such is the privilege of those who have perished.”[458] She spoke, nor did the father of gods and men disobey her;[459] yet he wept tears of blood that fell to the ground, for the sake[460] of his beloved son, whom now Patroklos was presently[461] to kill, by generous Troy and far from the land of his fathers.[462] Now as these two advancing had come close to each other[463] there Patroklos threw first at glorious Thrasymelos[464] who was the strong henchman of lord Sarpedon, and struck him[465] in the depth of the lower belly, and unstrung his limbs’ strength.[466] Sarpedon with the second throw then missed with the shining[467] spear, but the spear fixed in the right shoulder of Pedasos[468] the horse, who screamed as he blew his life away, and went down[469] in shrill noise into the dust, and the life spirit flittered from him.[470] The other horses shied apart, the yoke creaked, the guide reins[471] were fouled together as the trace horse lay in the dust beside them;[472] but at this spear-famed Automedon saw what he must do[473] and wrenching out the long-edged sword from beside his big thigh[474] in a flashing stroke and without faltering cut loose the trace horse[475] and the other horses were straightened out, and pulled in the guide reins,[476] and the two heroes came together in the heart-perishing battle.[477] Once again Sarpedon threw wide with a cast of his shining[478] spear, so that the pointed head overshot the left shoulder[479] of Patroklos; and now Patroklos made the second cast with the brazen[480] spear, and the shaft escaping his hand was not flung vainly[481] but struck where the beating heart is closed in the arch of the muscles.[482] He fell, as when an oak goes down or a white poplar,[483] or like a towering pine tree which in the mountains the carpenters[484] have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship-timber.[485] So he lay there felled in front of his horses and chariots[486] roaring, and clawed with his hands at the bloody dust; or as[487] a blazing and haughty bull in a huddle of shambling cattle[488] when a lion has come among the herd and destroys him[489] dies bellowing under the hooked claws of the lion, so now[490] before Patroklos the lord of the shield-armoured Lykians[491] died raging, and called aloud to his beloved companion:[492] “Dear Glaukos, you are a fighter among men. Now the need comes  p 199  [493] hardest upon you to be a spearman and a bold warrior.[494] Now, if you are brave, let bitter warfare be dear to you.[495] First you must go among all men who are lords of the Lykians[496] everywhere, and stir them up to fight for Sarpedon,[497] and then you yourself also must fight for me with the bronze spear.[498] For I shall be a thing of shame and a reproach said of you[499] afterwards, all your days forever, if the Achaians[500] strip my armour here where I fell by the ships assembled.[501] But hold strongly on and stir up all the rest of our people.”[502] He spoke, and as he spoke death’s end closed over his nostrils[503] and eyes, and Patroklos stepping heel braced to chest dragged[504] the spear out of his body, and the midriff came away with it[505] so that he drew out with the spearhead the life of Sarpedon,[506] and the Myrmidons close by held in the hard-breathing horses[507] as they tried to bolt away, once free of their master’s chariot.[508] But when he heard the voice a hard sorrow came upon Glaukos,[509] and the heart was stirred within him, and he could not defend Sarpedon.[510] He took his arm in his hand and squeezed it, since the wound hurt him[511] where Teukros had hit him with an arrow shot as he swept in[512] on the high wall, and fended destruction from his companions.[513] He spoke in prayer to him who strikes from afar, Apollo:[514] “Hear me, my lord. You are somewhere in the rich Lykian countryside[515] or here in Troy, and wherever you are you can listen[516] to a man in pain, as now this pain has descended upon me.[517] For see, I have this strong wound on me, and my arm on both sides[518] is driven with sharp pains about, my blood is not able[519] to dry and stop running, my shoulder is aching beneath it.[520] I cannot hold my spear up steady, I cannot go forward[521] to fight against the enemy. And the best of men has perished,[522] Sarpedon, son of Zeus; who will not stand by his children.[523] No, but you at least, my lord, make well this strong wound;[524] and put the pains to sleep, give me strength, so that I may call out[525] to my companions, the Lykians, and stir them to fight on,[526] and I myself do battle over the fallen body.”[527] So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him.[528] At once he made the pains stop, and dried away from the hard wound[529] the dark running of blood, and put strength into his spirit.[530] And Glaukos knew in his heart what was done, and was happy[531] that the great god had listened to his prayer. And first of all[532] he roused toward battle all the men who were lords of the Lykians,[533] going everywhere among them, to fight for Sarpedon;[534] afterwards he ranged in long strides among the Trojans,[535] by Poulydamas the son of Panthoös and brilliant Agenor,[536] and went to Aineias and to Hektor of the brazen helmet[537] and stood near them and addressed them in winged words: “Hektor,[538] now you have utterly forgotten your armed companions[539] who for your sake, far from their friends and the land of their fathers,[540] are wearing their lives away, and you will do nothing to help them.[541] Sarpedon has fallen, the lord of the shield-armoured Lykians,[542] who defended Lykia in his strength and the right of his justice.[543] Now brazen Ares has struck him down by the spear of Patroklos.[544] Then, friends, stand beside me, let the thought be shame in your spirit  p 200  [545] that they might strip away his arms, and dishonour his body,[546] these Myrmidons, in anger for all the Danaans perished,[547] those whom we Lykians have killed with the spear by the swift ships.”[548] He spoke, and the Trojans were taken head to heel with a sorrow[549] untakeable, not to be endured, since he was their city’s[550] stay, always, though he was an outlander, and many people[551] came with him, but he was the best of them all in battle[552] always. They went straight for the Danaans, raging, and Hektor[553] led them, in anger for Sarpedon. Meanwhile the Achaians[554] roused to the savage heart of Patroklos, the son Menoitios.[555] First he spoke to the Aiantes, who were burning for battle already:[556] “Aiantes, now your desire must be to defend yourselves, and be[557] such as you were among men before, or even more valiant.[558] The man is fallen who first scaled the wall of the Achaians,[559] Sarpedon. If only we could win and dishonour his body[560] and strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill with the pitiless[561] bronze some one of his companions who fight to defend him.”[562] He spoke, and they likewise grew furious in their defence,[563] and when they on either side had made massive their battalions,[564] Trojans and Lykians, and Myrmidons and Achaians,[565] they clashed together in battle over the perished body[566] howling terribly, with a high crash of the men on their armour,[567] while Zeus swept ghastly night far over the strong encounter[568] that over his dear son might be deadly work in the fighting.[569] First the Trojans shouldered back the glancing-eyed Achaians[570] when a man, and not the worst of the Myrmidons, was struck down,[571] son of high-hearted Agakles, Epeigeus the brilliant.[572] He was one who was lord before in strong-founded Boudeion,[573] but now, since he had happened to kill his high-born cousin,[574] had come suppliant to Peleus and to Thetis the silver-footed,[575] and these sent him to follow Achilleus, who broke men in battle,[576] to Ilion of the horses and the battle against the Trojans.[577] As he caught at a dead man glorious Hektor hit him[578] with a stone in the head, and all the head broke into two pieces[579] inside the heavy helmet, and he in the dust face downward[580] dropped, while death breaking the spirit drifted about him.[581] And the sorrow took hold of Patroklos for his fallen companion.[582] He steered his way through the ranks of the front fighters, like a flying[583] hawk who scatters into flight the daws and the starlings.[584] So straight for the Lykians, o lord of horses, Patroklos,[585] you swept, and for the Trojans, heart angered for your companion.[586] Now he struck Sthenelaos, beloved son of Ithaimenes,[587] in the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons loose from about it.[588] The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor.[589] As far as goes the driving cast of a slender javelin[590] which a man throws making trial of his strength, either in a contest[591] or else in battle, under the heart-breaking hostilities,[592] so far the Trojans gave way with the Achaians pushing them.[593] But Glaukos was first, lord of the shield-armoured Lykians,[594] to turn again, and killed Bathykles he great-hearted, beloved[595] son of Chalkon, who had dwelled in his home in Hellas[596] conspicuous for wealth and success among all the Myrmidons.  p 201  [597] It was he whom Glaukos stabbed in the middle of the chest, turning[598] suddenly back with his spear as he overtook him. He fell,[599] thunderously, and the closing sorrow came over the Achaians[600] as the great man went down, but the Trojans were gladdened greatly[601] and came and stood in a pack about him, nor did the Achaians[602] let go of their fighting strength, but steered their fury straight at them.[603] And there Meriones cut down a chief man of the Trojans,[604] Laogonos, bold son of Onetor, who was Idaian,[605] Zeus’ priest, and who was honoured in his countryside as a god is.[606] Meriones struck him by jaw and ear, and at once the life spirit[607] fled from his limbs, and the hateful darkness closed in about him.[608] But Aineias threw his bronze spear at Meriones, hoping[609] to hit him as he came down forward under his shield’s covering,[610] but Meriones with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear.[611] For he bent forward, and behind his back the long spearshaft[612] was driven into the ground so that the butt end was shaken[613] on the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took the force from it[614] [so that the vibrant shaft of Aineias was driven groundward[615] since it had been thrown in a vain cast from his big hand].[616] But Aineias was angered in his spirit, and called out to him:[617] “Meriones, though you are a dancer my spear might have stopped you[618] now and for all time, if only I could have hit you.”[619] Then in turn Meriones the spear-famed answered him:[620] “Aineias, strong fighter though you are, it would be hard for you[621] to quench the strength of every man who might come against you[622] and defend himself, since you also are made as a mortal.[623] But if I could throw and hit you with the sharp bronze in the middle,[624] then strong as you are and confident in your hands’ work, you might[625] give the glory to me, and your soul to Hades of the horses.”[626] He spoke, but the fighting son of Menoitios reprimanded him:[627] “Meriones, when you are a brave fighter, why say such things?—[628] See, dear friend, the Trojans will not give back from the body[629] for hard words spoken. Sooner the ground will cover them. Warfare’s[630] finality lies in the work of hands, that of words in counsel.[631] It is not for us now to pile up talk, but to fight in battle.”[632] He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal[633] like a god. As the tumult goes up from men who are cutting[634] timber in the mountain valleys, and the sound is heard from far off,[635] such was the dull crashing that rose from earth of the wide ways,[636] from the bronze shields, the skins and the strong-covering ox-hides[637] as the swords and leaf-headed spears stabbed against them. No longer[638] could a man, even a knowing one, have made out the godlike[639] Sarpedon, since he was piled from head to ends of feet under[640] a mass of weapons, the blood and the dust, while others about him[641] kept forever swarming over his dead body, as flies[642] through a sheepfold thunder about the pails overspilling[643] milk, in the season of spring when the milk splashes in the buckets.[644] So they swarmed over the dead man, nor did Zeus ever[645] turn the glaring of his eyes from the strong encounter,[646] but kept gazing forever upon them, in spirit reflective,[647] and pondered hard over many ways for the death of Patroklos;[648] whether this was now the time, in this strong encounter,  p 202  [649] when there over godlike Sarpedon glorious Hektor[650] should kill him with the bronze, and strip the armour away from his shoulders,[651] or whether to increase the steep work of fighting for more men.[652] In the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[653] for the strong henchman of Achilleus, the son of Peleus,[654] once again to push the Trojans and bronze-helmed Hektor[655] back on their city, and tear the life from many. In Hektor[656] first of all he put a temper that was without strength.[657] He climbed to his chariot and turned to flight, and called to the other[658] Trojans to run, for he saw the way of Zeus’ sacred balance.[659] Nor did the powerful Lykians stand now, but were all scattered[660] to flight, when they had seen their king with a spear in his heart, lying[661] under the pile of dead men, since many others had fallen[662] above him, once Zeus had strained fast the powerful conflict.[663] But the Achaians took from Sarpedon’s shoulders the armour[664] glaring and brazen, and this the warlike son of Menoitios[665] gave to his companions to carry back to the hollow ships.[666] And now Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke a word to Apollo:[667] “Go if you will, beloved Phoibos, and rescue Sarpedon[668] from under the weapons, wash the dark suffusion of blood from him,[669] then carry him far away and wash him in a running river,[670] anoint him in ambrosia, put ambrosial clothing upon him;[671] then give him into the charge of swift messengers to carry him,[672] of Sleep and Death, who are twin brothers, and these two shall lay him[673] down presently within the rich countryside of broad Lykia[674] where his brothers and countrymen shall give him due burial[675] with tomb and gravestone. Such is the privilege of those who have perished.”[676] He spoke so, and Apollo, not disregarding his father,[677] went down along the mountains of Ida, into the grim fight,[678] and lifting brilliant Sarpedon out from under the weapons[679] carried him far away, and washed him in a running river,[680] and anointed him in ambrosia, put ambrosial clothing upon him,[681] then gave him into the charge of swift messengers to carry him,[682] of Sleep and Death, who are twin brothers, and these two presently[683] laid him down within the rich countryside of broad Lykia.[684] But Patroklos, with a shout to Automedon and his horses,[685] went after Trojans and Lykians in a huge blind fury.[686] Besotted: had he only kept the command of Peleïdes[687] he might have got clear away from the evil spirit of black death.[688] But always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man’s mind.[689] He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory[690] lightly, when he himself has driven a man into battle[691] as now he drove on the fury in the heart of Patroklos.[692] Then who was it you slaughtered first, who was the last one,[693] Patroklos, as the gods called you to your death? Adrestos[694] first, and after him Autonoös and Echeklos,[695] Perimos, son of Megas, and Epistor, and Melanippos,[696] and after these Elasos, and Moulios, and Pylartes.[697] These he killed, while each man of the rest was bent on escaping.[698] There the sons of the Achaians might have taken gate-towering Ilion  p 203  [699] under the hands of Patroklos, who raged with the spear far before them,[700] had not Phoibos Apollo taken his stand on the strong-built[701] tower, with thoughts of death for him, but help for the Trojans.[702] Three times Patroklos tried to mount the angle of the towering[703] wall, and three times Phoibos Apollo battered him backward[704] with the immortal hands beating back the bright shield. As Patroklos[705] for the fourth time, like something more than a man, came at him[706] he called aloud, and spoke winged words in the voice of danger:[707] “Give way, illustrious Patroklos: it is not destined[708] that the city of the proud Trojans shall fall before your spear[709] nor even at the hand of Achilleus, who is far better than you are.”[710] He spoke, and Patroklos gave ground before him a great way,[711] avoiding the anger of him who strikes from afar, Apollo.[712] But Hektor inside the Skaian Gates held his single-foot horses,[713] and wondered whether to drive back into the carnage, and fight there,[714] or call aloud to his people to rally inside the wall. Thus[715] as he was pondering Phoibos Apollo came and stood by him,[716] assuming the likeness of a man, a young and a strong one,[717] Asios, who was uncle to Hektor, breaker of horses,[718] since he was brother of Hekabe, and the son of Dymas,[719] and had made his home in Phrygia by the stream of Sangarios.[720] In the likeness of this man Zeus’ son Apollo spoke to him:[721] “Hektor, why have you stopped fighting? You should not do it.[722] If I were as much stronger than you as now I am weaker![723] So might you, in this evil way, hold back from the fighting.[724] But come! Hold straight against Patroklos your strong-footed horses.[725] You might be able to kill him. Apollo might give you such glory.”[726] He spoke, and went once more, a divinity, into the mortals’[727] struggle, while glorious Hektor called to wise Kebriones[728] to lash their horses into the fighting. Meanwhile Apollo[729] went down into the battle, and launched a deadly confusion[730] upon the Argives, and gave glory to the Trojans and Hektor.[731] Now Hektor let the rest of the Danaans be, and he would not[732] kill them, but drove his strong-footed horses straight for Patroklos.[733] On the other side Patroklos sprang to the ground from his chariot[734] holding his spear in his left hand. In the other he caught up[735] a stone, jagged and shining, in the hold of his hand, and threw it,[736] leaning into the throw, nor fell short of the man he aimed at[737] nor threw vainly, but hit the charioteer of Hektor,[738] Kebriones, a bastard son of glorious Priam,[739] as he held the reins on his horses. The sharp stone hit him in the forehead[740] and smashed both brows in on each other, nor could the bone hold[741] the rock, but his eyes fell out into the dust before him[742] there at his feet, so that he vaulted to earth like a diver[743] from the carefully wrought chariot, and the life left his bones. Now[744] you spoke in bitter mockery over him, rider Patroklos:[745] “See now, what a light man this is, how agile an acrobat.[746] If only he were somewhere on the sea, where the fish swarm,[747] he could fill the hunger of many men, by diving for oysters;[748] he could go overboard from a boat even in rough weather[749] the way he somersaults so light to the ground from his chariot[750] now. So, to be sure, in Troy also they have their acrobats.”  p 204  [751] He spoke so, and strode against the hero Kebriones[752] with the spring of a lion, who as he ravages the pastures[753] has been hit in the chest, and his own courage destroys him.[754] So in your fury you pounced, Patroklos, above Kebriones.[755] On the other side Hektor sprang to the ground from his chariot,[756] and the two fought it out over Kebriones, like lions[757] who in the high places of a mountain, both in huge courage[758] and both hungry, fight together over a killed deer.[759] So above Kebriones these two, urgent for battle,[760] Patroklos, son of Menoitios, and glorious Hektor,[761] were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other;[762] since Hektor had caught him by the head, and would not let go of him,[763] and Patroklos had his foot on the other side, while the other[764] Trojans and Danaans drove together the strength of their onset.[765] As east wind and south wind fight it out with each other[766] in the valleys of the mountains to shake the deep forest timber,[767] oak tree and ash and the cornel with the delicate bark; these[768] whip their wide-reaching branches against one another[769] in inhuman noise, and the crash goes up from the splintering timber;[770] so Trojans and Achaians springing against one another[771] cut men down, nor did either side think of disastrous panic,[772] and many sharp spears were driven home about Kebriones[773] and many feathered arrows sprung from the bowstrings, many[774] great throwing stones pounded against the shields, as they fought on[775] hard over his body, as he in the turning dust lay[776] mightily in his might, his horsemanship all forgotten.[777] So long as the sun was climbing still to the middle heaven,[778] so long the thrown weapons of both took hold, and men dropped under them;[779] but when the sun had gone to the time for unyoking of cattle,[780] then beyond their very destiny the Achaians were stronger[781] and dragged the hero Kebriones from under the weapons[782] and the clamour of the Trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders.[783] And Patroklos charged with evil intention in on the Trojans.[784] Three times he charged in with the force of the running war god,[785] screaming a terrible cry, and three times he cut down nine men;[786] but as for the fourth time he swept in, like something greater[787] than human, there, Patroklos, the end of your life was shown forth,[788] since Phoibos came against you there in the strong encounter[789] dangerously, nor did Patroklos see him as he moved through[790] the battle, and shrouded in a deep mist came in against him[791] and stood behind him, and struck his back and his broad shoulders[792] with a flat stroke of the hand so that his eyes spun. Phoibos[793] Apollo now struck away from his head the helmet[794] four-horned and hollow-eyed, and under the feet of the horses[795] it rolled clattering, and the plumes above it were defiled[796] by blood and dust. Before this time it had not been permitted[797] to defile in the dust this great helmet crested in horse-hair;[798] rather it guarded the head and the gracious brow of a godlike[799] man, Achilleus; but now Zeus gave it over to Hektor[800] to wear on his head, Hektor whose own death was close to him.[801] And in his hands was splintered all the huge, great, heavy,[802] iron-shod, far-shadowing spear, and away from his shoulders  p 205  [803] dropped to the ground the shield with its shield sling and its tassels.[804] The lord Apollo, son of Zeus, broke the corselet upon him.[805] Disaster caught his wits, and his shining body went nerveless.[806] He stood stupidly, and from close behind his back a Dardanian[807] man hit him between the shoulders with a sharp javelin:[808] Euphorbos, son of Panthoös, who surpassed all men of his own age[809] with the throwing spear, and in horsemanship and the speed of his feet. He[810] had already brought down twenty men from their horses[811] since first coming, with his chariot and his learning in warfare.[812] He first hit you with a thrown spear, o rider Patroklos,[813] nor broke you, but ran away again, snatching out the ash spear[814] from your body, and lost himself in the crowd, not enduring[815] to face Patroklos, naked as he was, in close combat.[816] Now Patroklos, broken by the spear and the god’s blow, tried[817] to shun death and shrink back into the swarm of his own companions.[818] But Hektor, when he saw high-hearted Patroklos trying[819] to get away, saw how he was wounded with the sharp javelin,[820] came close against him across the ranks, and with the spear stabbed him[821] in the depth of the belly and drove the bronze clean through. He fell,[822] thunderously, to the horror of all the Achaian people.[823] As a lion overpowers a weariless boar in wild combat[824] as the two fight in their pride on the high places of a mountain[825] over a little spring of water, both wanting to drink there,[826] and the lion beats him down by force as he fights for his breath, so[827] Hektor, Priam’s son, with a close spear-stroke stripped the life[828] from the fighting son of Menoitios, who had killed so many,[829] and stood above him, and spoke aloud the winged words of triumph:[830] “Patroklos, you thought perhaps of devastating our city,[831] of stripping from the Trojan women the day of their liberty[832] and dragging them off in ships to the beloved land of your fathers.[833] Fool! When in front of them the running horses of Hektor[834] strained with their swift feet into the fighting, and I with my own spear[835] am conspicuous among the fighting Trojans, I who beat from them[836] the day of necessity. For you, here the vultures shall eat you.[837] Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.[838] When he stayed behind, and you went, he must have said much to you:[839] ‘Patroklos, lord of horses, see that you do not come back to me[840] and the hollow ships, until you have torn in blood the tunic[841] of manslaughtering Hektor about his chest.’ In some such[842] manner he spoke to you, and persuaded the fool’s heart in you.”[843] And now, dying, you answered him, o rider Patroklos:[844] “Now is your time for big words, Hektor. Yours is the victory[845] given by Kronos’ son, Zeus, and Apollo, who have subdued me[846] easily, since they themselves stripped the arms from my shoulders.[847] Even though twenty such as you had come in against me,[848] they would all have been broken beneath my spear, and have perished.[849] No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,[850] and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.[851] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[852] You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already[853] death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,[854] to go down under the hands of Aiakos’ great son, Achilleus.”[855] He spoke, and as he spoke the end of death closed in upon him,  p 206  [856] and the soul fluttering free of his limbs went down into Death’s house[857] mourning her destiny, leaving youth and manhood behind her.[858] Now though he was a dead man glorious Hektor spoke to him:[859] “Patroklos, what is this prophecy of my headlong destruction?[860] Who knows if even Achilleus, son of lovely-haired Thetis,[861] might before this be struck by my spear, and his own life perish?”[862] He spoke, and setting his heel upon him wrenched out the bronze spear[863] from the wound, then spurned him away on his back from the spear. Thereafter[864] armed with the spear he went on, aiming a cast at Automedon,[865] the godlike henchman for the swift-footed son of Aiakos,[866] with the spear as he was carried away by those swift and immortal[867] horses the gods had given as shining gifts to Peleus.book seventeen[1] As Patroklos went down before the Trojans in the hard fighting[2] he was not unseen by Atreus’ son, warlike Menelaos,[3] who stalked through the ranks of the champions, helmed in the bright bronze,[4] and bestrode the body, as over a first-born calf the mother[5] cow stands lowing, she who has known no children before this.[6] So Menelaos of the fair hair stood over Patroklos[7] and held the spear and the perfect circle of his shield before him,[8] raging to cut down any man who might come forth against him.[9] Nor did the fall of blameless Patroklos pass unattended[10] by Panthoös’ son of the strong ash spear, Euphorbos, who standing[11] close to face him spoke a word to warlike Menelaos:[12] “Son of Atreus, Menelaos, illustrious, leader of armies:[13] give way, let the bloody spoils be, get back from this body,[14] since before me no one of the Trojans, or renowned companions,[15] struck Patroklos down with the spear in the strong encounter.[16] Thereby let me win this great glory among the Trojans[17] before I hit you and strip the sweetness of life away from you.”[18] Deeply stirred, Menelaos of the fair hair answered him:[19] “Father Zeus, it is not well for the proud man to glory.[20] Neither the fury of the leopard is such, not such is the lion’s[21] nor the fury of the devastating wild boar, within whose breast[22] the spirit is biggest and vaunts in the pride of his strength, is so great[23] as goes the pride in these sons of Panthoös of the strong ash spear.[24] Yet even the strength of Hyperenor, breaker of horses,[25] had no joy of his youth when he stood against me and taunted me[26] and said that among all the Danaans I was the weakest[27] in battle. Yet I think that his feet shall no more carry him[28] back, to pleasure his beloved wife and his honoured parents.[29] So I think I can break your strength as well, if you only[30] stand against me. No, but I myself tell you to get back[31] into the multitude, not stand to face me, before you[32] take some harm. Once a thing has been done, the fool sees it.”[33] He spoke so, but did not persuade Euphorbos, who answered:[34] “Then, lordly Menelaos, you must now pay the penalty[35] for my brother, whom you killed, and boast that you did it,  p 207  [36] and made his wife a widow in the depth of a young bride chamber[37] and left to his parents the curse of lamentation and sorrow.[38] Yet I might stop the mourning of these unhappy people[39] if I could carry back to them your head, and your armour,[40] and toss them into Panthoös’ hands, and to Phrontis the lovely.[41] No, this struggle shall not go long untested between us[42] nor yet unfought, whether it prove our strength or our terror.”[43] He spoke, and stabbed Menelaos’ shield in its perfect circle,[44] nor did the bronze break its way through, but the spearhead bent back[45] in the strong shield. And after him Atreus’ son, Menelaos,[46] made his prayer to father Zeus and lunged with the bronze spear[47] and as he was drawing back caught him in the pit of the gullet[48] and leaned in on the stroke in the confidence of his strong hand,[49] and clean through the soft part of the neck the spearpoint was driven.[50] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him,[51] and his hair, lovely as the Graces, was splattered with blood, those[52] braided locks caught waspwise in gold and silver. As some[53] slip of an olive tree strong-growing that a man raises[54] in a lonely place, and drenched it with generous water, so that[55] it blossoms into beauty, and the blasts of winds from all quarters[56] tremble it, and it bursts into pale blossoming. But then[57] a wind suddenly in a great tempest descending upon it[58] wrenches it out of its stand and lays it at length on the ground; such[59] was Euphorbos of the strong ash spear, the son of Panthoös,[60] whom Menelaos Atreides killed, and was stripping his armour.[61] As when in the confidence of his strength some lion[62] hill-reared snatches the finest cow in a herd as it pastures;[63] first the lion breaks her neck caught fast in the strong teeth,[64] then gulps down the blood and all the guts that are inward[65] savagely, as the dogs and the herdsmen raise a commotion[66] loudly about him, but from a distance, and are not willing[67] to go in and face him, since the hard green fear has hold of them;[68] so no heart in the breast of any Trojan had courage[69] to go in and face glorious Menelaos. Then easily[70] the son of Atreus might have taken the glorious armour[71] from Panthoös’ son, only Phoibos Apollo begrudged him[72] and stirred up Hektor, a match for the running war god, against him[73] in semblance of a man, the leader of the Kikones,[74] Mentes, and spoke aloud to him, and addressed him in winged words:[75] “While you, Hektor, run after what can never be captured,[76] the horses of valiant Aiakides; they are difficult horses[77] for mortal man to manage, or even to ride behind them[78] for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother;[79] meanwhile Menelaos, the warlike son of Atreus,[80] stands over Patroklos and has killed the best man of the Trojans,[81] Euphorbos, Panthoös’ son, and stopped his furious valour.”[82] So he spoke, and went back, a god, to the mortals’ struggle.[83] But bitter sorrow closed over Hektor’s heart in its darkness.[84] He looked about then across the ranks, and at once was aware[85] of the two men, one stripping the glorious armour, the other[86] sprawled on the ground, and blood running from the gash of the spear-thrust.[87] He stalked through the ranks of the champions helmed in the bright bronze  p 208  [88] with a shrill scream, and looking like the flame of Hephaistos,[89] weariless. Nor did Atreus’ son fail to hear the sharp cry.[90] Deeply troubled, he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[91] “Ah me; if I abandon here the magnificent armour,[92] and Patroklos, who has fallen here for the sake of my honour,[93] shall not some one of the Danaans, seeing it, hold it against me?[94] Yet if I fight, alone as I am, the Trojans and Hektor[95] for shame, shall they not close in, many against one, about me?[96] Hektor of the shining helm leads all of the Trojans[97] here. Then why does my own heart within me debate this?[98] When a man, in the face of divinity, would fight with another[99] whom some god honours, the big disaster rolls sudden upon him.[100] Therefore, let no Danaan seeing it hold it against me[101] if I give way before Hektor, who fights from God. Yet if somewhere[102] I could only get some word of Aias of the great war cry,[103] we two might somehow go, and keep our spirit of battle[104] even in the face of divinity, if we might win the body[105] for Peleïd Achilleus. It would be our best among evils.”[106] Now as he was pondering this in his heart and his spirit[107] meanwhile the ranks of the Trojans came on, and Hektor led them;[108] and Menelaos backed away from them and left the dead man,[109] but kept turning on his way like some great bearded lion[110] when dogs and men drive him off from a steading with weapons[111] and shouts, and in the breast of the lion the strong heart of valour[112] freezes, and he goes reluctant away from the fenced ground.[113] So fair-haired Menelaos moved from Patroklos, but turning[114] stood fast when he had got back to the swarm of his own companions,[115] and looked all about for huge Aias, the son of Telamon,[116] and saw soon where he was, at the left of the entire battle[117] encouraging his companions and urging them into the fighting,[118] since Phoibos Apollo had smitten them all with unearthly terror.[119] He went on the run, and presently stood beside him and spoke to him:[120] “This way, Aias, we must make for fallen Patroklos[121] to try if we can carry back to Achilleus the body[122] which is naked; Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.”[123] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit in valiant Aias[124] who strode among the champions, fair-haired Menelaos with him.[125] But Hektor, when he had stripped from Patroklos the glorious armour,[126] dragged at him, meaning to cut his head from his shoulders with the sharp bronze,[127] to haul off the body and give it to the dogs of Troy; but meanwhile[128] Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield,[129] and Hektor drew back to the company of his own companions[130] and sprang to his chariot, but handed over the beautiful armour[131] to the Trojans, to take back to the city and to be his great glory.[132] Now Aias covering the son of Menoitios under his broad shield[133] stood fast, like a lion over his young, when the lion[134] is leading his little ones along, and men who are hunting[135] come upon them in the forest. He stands in the pride of his great strength[136] hooding his eyes under the cover of down-drawn eyelids.[137] Such was Aias as he bestrode the hero Patroklos,  p 209  [138] while on the other side Atreus’ son, warlike Menelaos,[139] stood fast, feeding still bigger the great sorrow within him.[140] But Glaukos, lord of the Lykian men, the son of Hippolochos,[141] looked at Hektor, scowling, and laid a harsh word upon him:[142] “Hektor, splendid to look at, you come far short in your fighting.[143] That fame of yours, high as it is, belongs to a runner.[144] Take thought now how to hold fast your town, your citadel[145] by yourself, with those your people who were born in Ilion;[146] since no Lykian will go forth now to fight with the Danaans[147] for the sake of your city, since after all we got no gratitude[148] for our everlasting hard struggle against your enemies.[149] How then, o hard-hearted, shall you save a worse man in all your[150] company, when you have abandoned Sarpedon, your guest-friend[151] and own companion, to be the spoil and prey of the Argives,[152] who was of so much use to you, yourself and your city[153] while he lived? Now you have not the spirit to keep the dogs from him.[154] Therefore now, if any of the Lykian men will obey me,[155] we are going home, and the headlong destruction of Troy shall be manifest.[156] For if the Trojans had any fighting strength that were daring[157] and unshaken, such as comes on men who, for the sake of their country,[158] have made the hard hateful work come between them and their enemies,[159] we could quickly get the body of Patroklos inside Ilion.[160] If, dead man though he be, he could be brought into the great city[161] of lord Priam, if we could tear him out of the fighting,[162] the Argives must at once give up the beautiful armour[163] of Sarpedon, and we could carry his body inside Ilion.[164] Such is the man whose henchman is killed. He is far the greatest[165] of the Argives by the ships, and his men fight hard at close quarters.[166] No, but you could not bring yourself to stand up against Aias[167] of the great heart, nor to look at his eyes in the clamour of fighting[168] men, nor attack him direct, since he is far better than you are.”[169] Looking darkly at him tall Hektor of the shining helm answered:[170] “Glaukos, why did a man like you speak this word of annoyance?[171] I am surprised. I thought that for wits you surpassed all others[172] of those who dwell in Lykia where the soil is generous; and yet[173] now I utterly despise your heart for the thing you have spoken[174] when you said I cannot stand in the face of gigantic Aias.[175] I am not one who shudders at attack and the thunder of horses.[176] But always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man’s mind.[177] He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory[178] lightly, when he himself has driven a man into battle.[179] Come here, friend, and watch me at work; learn, standing beside me,[180] whether I shall be a coward all day, as you proclaim me,[181] or whether I stop some Danaan, for all of his fury,[182] from his fighting strength and from the defence of fallen Patroklos.”[183] So speaking he called afar in a great voice to the Trojans:[184] “Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,[185] be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour[186] while I am putting on the beautiful armour of blameless[187] Achilleus, which I stripped from Patroklos the strong when I killed him.”[188] So spoke Hektor of the shining helm, and departed  p 210  [189] from the hateful battle, and running caught up with his companions[190] very soon, since he went on quick feet, and they had not gone far[191] carrying the glorious armour of Peleus’ son toward the city.[192] He stood apart from the sorrowful fighting, and changed his armour,[193] and gave what he had worn to the fighting Trojans to carry[194] to sacred Ilion, and himself put on that armour immortal[195] of Peleïd Achilleus, which the Uranian gods had given[196] to his loved father; and he in turn grown old had given it[197] to his son; but a son who never grew old in his father’s armour.[198] When Zeus who gathers the clouds saw him, apart from the others[199] arming himself in the battle gear of godlike Peleïdes,[200] he stirred his head and spoke to his own spirit: “Ah, poor wretch![201] There is no thought of death in your mind now, and yet death stands[202] close beside you as you put on the immortal armour[203] of a surpassing man. There are others who tremble before him.[204] Now you have killed this man’s dear friend, who was strong and gentle,[205] and taken the armour, as you should not have done, from his shoulders[206] and head. Still for the present I will invest you with great strength[207] to make up for it that you will not come home out of the fighting,[208] nor Andromache take from your hands the glorious arms of Achilleus.”[209] He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his head with the dark brows.[210] The armour was fitted to Hektor’s skin, and Ares the dangerous[211] war god entered him, so that the inward body was packed full[212] of force and fighting strength. He went onward calling in a great voice[213] to his renowned companions in arms, and figured before them[214] flaming in the battle gear of great-hearted Peleion.[215] He ranged their ranks, and spoke a word to encourage each captain,[216] to Mesthles and Glaukos, to Thersilochos and Medon,[217] Deisenor and Hippothoös and Asteropaios,[218] to Phorkys and Chromios and the bird interpreter Ennomos,[219] and stirring all of these forward called to them in winged words:[220] “Hear me, you numberless hordes of companions who live at our borders.[221] It was not for any desire nor need of a multitude[222] that man by man I gathered you to come here from your cities,[223] but so that you might have good will to defend the innocent[224] children of the Trojans, and their wives, from the fighting Achaians.[225] With such a purpose I wear out my own people for presents[226] and food, wherewith I make strong the spirit within each one of you.[227] Therefore a man must now turn his face straight forward, and perish[228] or survive. This is the sweet invitation of battle.[229] That man of you who drags Patroklos, dead as he is, back[230] among Trojans, breakers of horses, and Aias gives way before him,[231] I will give him half the spoils for his portion, and keep half[232] for myself, and his glory shall be as great as mine is.”[233] So he spoke, and they lifted their spears and went straight for the Danaans[234] who felt their weight, and inside each man the spirit was hopeful[235] to get the body away from Telamonian Aias.[236] Fools! Since over the dead man he tore the life out of many.[237] Then Aias himself spoke to Menelaos of the great war cry:[238] “Illustrious Menelaos, dear friend, I no longer have hope[239] that even you and I can win back out of the fighting.[240] My fear is not so much for the dead body of Patroklos[241] who presently must glut the dogs and the birds of Troy, so much  p 211  [242] as I fear for my own head, my life, and what may befall it,[243] and for yours, since this cloud of war is darkened on all things,[244] this Hektor, while for you and me sheer death is emerging.[245] Come then, call the great men of the Danaans, if one might hear you.”[246] He spoke, and Menelaos of the great war cry obeyed him.[247] He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:[248] “Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,[249] you that beside Agamemnon and Menelaos, the two sons[250] of Atreus, drink the community’s wine and give, each man, his orders[251] to the people; and from Zeus the respect and honour attend you.[252] It is hard for me to discriminate among you each man[253] who is a leader, so big is the bitter fight that has blazed up.[254] Then let a man come of his own accord, think it shameful[255] that Patroklos be given to the dogs of Troy to delight them.”[256] He spoke, and swift Aias son of Oïleus was sharp to hear him[257] and was first to come running along the battle, and join him,[258] and after him Idomeneus, and Idomeneus’ companion[259] Meriones, a match for the murderous lord of battles.[260] But what man could tell forth from his heart the names of the others,[261] all who after these waked the war strength of the Achaians?[262] The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them.[263] As when at the outpouring place of a rain-glutted river[264] the huge surf of the sea roars against the current, out-jutting[265] beaches thunder aloud to the backwash of the salt water,[266] with such a bellow the Trojans came on, but now the Achaians[267] stood fast about the son of Menoitios, in a single courage[268] and fenced beneath their bronze-armoured shields, while the son of Kronos[269] drifted across the glitter of their helmets a deepening[270] mist; since before this time he had not hated Menoitios’[271] son, while he lived yet and was Achilleus’ companion,[272] and loathed now that he should become the spoil of the hated[273] Trojans’ dogs, and stirred his companions on to defend him.[274] First the Trojans shouldered back the glancing-eyed Achaians,[275] who abandoned the body and ran for terror, nor did the high-hearted[276] Trojans take any with their spears, for all of their striving,[277] but dragged at the dead man, only the Achaians were not long destined[278] to fail him, since they were pulled around in sudden speed[279] by Aias, who for his beauty and the work of his hands surpassed[280] all other Danaans, after the blameless son of Peleus.[281] He steered through the front fighters in pride of strength like a savage[282] wild boar, who among the mountains easily scatters[283] the dogs and strong young men when he turns at bay in the valley.[284] So now the son of haughty Telamon, glorious Aias,[285] turned to charge and easily scatter the Trojan battalions,[286] who had taken their stand bestriding Patroklos, in high hope[287] of dragging him off to their own city, and so winning honour.[288] Indeed, Hippothoös, glorious son of Pelasgian Lethos,[289] was trying to drag him by the foot through the strong encounter[290] by fastening the sling of his shield round the ankle tendons[291] for the favour of Hektor and the Trojans, but the sudden evil[292] came to him, and none for all their desire could defend him.[293] The son of Telamon, sweeping in through the mass of the fighters,[294] struck him at close quarters through the brazen cheeks of his helmet  p 212  [295] and the helm crested with horse-hair was riven about the spearhead[296] to the impact of the huge spear and the weight of the hand behind it[297] and the brain ran from the wound along the spear by the eye-hole,[298] bleeding. There his strength was washed away, and from his hands[299] he let fall to the ground the foot of great-hearted Patroklos[300] to lie there, and himself collapsed prone over the dead man[301] far away from generous Larisa, and he could not[302] render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,[303] beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Aias.[304] Again Hektor threw at Aias with the shining javelin,[305] but Aias with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear[306] by a little, and Hektor struck Schedios, the son of high-hearted[307] Iphitos and far the best of the Phokians, one who lived[308] in his home in famous Panopeus and was lord over many people.[309] He struck him fair beneath the collar-bone, and the pointed[310] bronze head tore clean through and came out by the base of the shoulder.[311] He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.[312] But Aias in turn cut at Phorkys, the wise son of Phainops,[313] in the middle of the belly as he stood over fallen Hippothoös,[314] and broke the hollow of the corselet, so that the entrails spurted[315] from the bronze, and he went down clawing the dust in his fingers.[316] The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor,[317] and the Argives gave a great cry and dragged back the bodies[318] of Hippothoös and Phorkys, and eased the armour from their shoulders.[319] Then, once more, might the Trojans have climbed back into Ilion’s[320] wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians,[321] and the Argives, even beyond Zeus’ destiny, might have won glory[322] by their own force and strength, had not Apollo in person[323] stirred on Aineias; he had assumed the form of the herald[324] Periphas, Epytos’ son, growing old in his herald’s office[325] by Aineias’ aged father, and a man whose thoughts were of kindness.[326] In the likeness of this man Zeus’ son Apollo spoke to him:[327] “Aineias, how could you be the men to defend sheer Ilion[328] even against a god’s will, as I have seen other men do it[329] in the confidence of their own force and strength, their own manhood[330] and their own numbers, though they had too few people for it?[331] But now Zeus wishes the victory far rather for our side[332] than the Danaans’, only yourselves keep blenching and will not fight them.”[333] So he spoke, but Aineias knew far-striking Apollo[334] as he looked him straight in the face, and called in a great voice to Hektor:[335] “Hektor, and you other lords of the Trojans and their companions,[336] here is a shameful thing! We are climbing back into Ilion’s[337] wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians.[338] Yet see, some one of the gods is standing beside me, and tells me[339] that Zeus the supreme counsellor lends his weight to our fighting.[340] Therefore we must go straight for the Danaans, so that they may not[341] carry thus easily back to their ships the fallen Patroklos.”[342] He spoke, and with a long leap stood far before the front fighters,[343] and the Trojans turned and held their ground against the Achaians.[344] And now Aineias killed Leiokritos, with a spear-thrust,[345] the son of Arisbas and noble companion of Lykomedes;[346] but as he fell the warrior Lykomedes pitied him,  p 213  [347] and stood close in, and made a cast with the shining javelin[348] and struck Apisaon, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the people,[349] in the liver under the midriff, and the strength of his knees was broken.[350] He was one who had come from Paionia of the rich soil[351] and was best of her men in fighting next to Asteropaios.[352] As this man fell, warlike Asteropaios pitied him[353] and he in turn drove forward eager to fight with the Danaans,[354] but was not able to do it, for they, standing about Patroklos,[355] fenced him behind their shields on all sides, and held their spears out-thrust.[356] For Aias ranged their whole extent with his numerous orders,[357] and would not let any man give back from the body, nor let one[358] go out and fight by himself far in front of the other Achaians,[359] but made them stand hard and fast about him and fight at close quarters.[360] Such were the orders of gigantic Aias. The ground ran[361] with red blood, the dead men dropped one after another[362] from the ranks alike of Trojans and their mighty companions[363] and Danaans also, since these fought not without bloodletting,[364] but far fewer of them went down, since they ever remembered[365] always to stand massed and beat sudden death from each other.[366] So they fought on in the likeness of fire, nor would you have thought[367] the sun was still secure in his place in the sky, nor the moon, since[368] the mist was closed over all that part of the fight where the bravest[369] stood about Patroklos, the fallen son of Menoitios.[370] Now elsewhere the rest of the Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians[371] fought naturally in the bright air, with the sun’s sharp glitter[372] everywhere about them, no cloud was showing anywhere[373] on earth nor on the mountains. They fought their battle by intervals[374] standing each well off at a distance, avoiding the painful[375] shots from the other side; but they in the middle were suffering[376] distress in the mist and the fighting, with the cruel bronze wearing them.[377] These men were the bravest, but there were two men of glory,[378] Thrasymedes and Antilochos, who had not yet heard[379] how Patroklos the blameless had been killed, but still thought[380] he was alive and fighting in the first shock with the Trojans.[381] But these two, watching against death or flight in their company,[382] fought their separate battle, since such was their order from Nestor[383] as he was urging them forth from the black ships into the fighting.[384] So for these daylong the hard bitterness of the wearing[385] battle rose. With the ever-relentless sweat and the weariness[386] knees, legs, and feet that supported from underneath each fighter,[387] their hands and eyes also were running wet as they fought on[388] over the brave henchman of swift-footed Aiakides.[389] As when a man gives the hide of a great ox, a bullock,[390] drenched first deep in fat, to all his people to stretch out;[391] the people take it from him and stand in a circle about it[392] and pull, and presently the moisture goes and the fat sinks[393] in, with so many pulling, and the bull’s hide is stretched out level;[394] so the men of both sides in a cramped space tugged at the body[395] in both directions; and the hearts of the Trojans were hopeful[396] to drag him away to Ilion, those of the Achaians[397] to get him back to the hollow ships. And about him a savage[398] struggle arose. Not Ares who rallies men, not Athene,  p 214  [399] watching this fight could have scorned it, not even in some strong anger,[400] such was the wicked work of battle for men and for horses[401] Zeus strained tight above Patroklos that day. But the brilliant[402] Achilleus did not yet know at all that Patroklos had fallen.[403] Since now the men were fighting far away from the fast ships[404] under the Trojan wall, and Achilleus had no expectation[405] that Patroklos was dead, but thought he was alive and close under[406] the gates, and would come back. He had not thought that Patroklos[407] would storm the city without himself, nor with himself either;[408] for often he had word from his mother, not known to mortals;[409] she was ever telling him what was the will of great Zeus; but this time[410] his mother did not tell Achilleus of all the evil[411] that had been done, nor how his dearest companion had perished.[412] So they about the body gripping their headed spears kept[413] inexorably close together, and slaughtered on both sides.[414] And such would be the saying of some bronze-armoured Achaian:[415] “Friends, there is no glory for us if we go back again[416] to our hollow ships, but here and now let the black earth open[417] gaping for all; this would soon be far better for us[418] if we give up this man to the Trojans, breakers of horses,[419] to take away to their own city and win glory from him.”[420] And such in turn would be the cry of some high-hearted Trojan:[421] “O friends, though it be destined for all of us to be killed here[422] over this man, still none of us must give ground from the fighting.”[423] Thus a man would speak, and stir the spirit in each one[424] of his fellowship. So they fought on, and the iron tumult[425] went up into the brazen sky through the barren bright air.[426] But the horses of Aiakides standing apart from the battle[427] wept, as they had done since they heard how their charioteer[428] had fallen in the dust at the hands of murderous Hektor.[429] In truth Automedon, the powerful son of Diores,[430] hit them over and over again with the stroke of the flying[431] lash, or talked to them, sometimes entreating them, sometimes threatening.[432] They were unwilling to go back to the wide passage of Helle[433] and the ships, or back into the fighting after the Achaians,[434] but still as stands a grave monument which is set over[435] the mounded tomb of a dead man or lady, they stood there[436] holding motionless in its place the fair-wrought chariot,[437] leaning their heads along the ground, and warm tears were running[438] earthward from underneath the lids of the mourning horses[439] who longed for their charioteer, while their bright manes were made dirty[440] as they streamed down either side of the yoke from under the yoke pad.[441] As he watched the mourning horses the son of Kronos pitied them,[442] and stirred his head and spoke to his own spirit: “Poor wretches,[443] why then did we ever give you to the lord Peleus,[444] a mortal man, and you yourselves are immortal and ageless?[445] Only so that among unhappy men you also might be grieved?[446] Since among all creatures that breathe on earth and crawl on it[447] there is not anywhere a thing more dismal than man is.[448] At least the son of Priam, Hektor, shall not mount behind you[449] in the carefully wrought chariot. I will not let him. Is it not[450] enough for him that he has the armour and glories in wearing it?  p 215  [451] But now I will put vigour into your knees and your spirits[452] so that you bring back Automedon out of the fighting[453] safe to the hollow ships; since I shall still give the Trojans[454] the glory of killing, until they win to the strong-benched vessels,[455] until the sun goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.”[456] So spoke Zeus, and breathed great vigour into the horses,[457] and they shaking the dust from their manes to the ground lightly[458] carried the running chariot among the Achaians and Trojans.[459] Automedon fought from them, though grieving for his companion.[460] He would dash in, like a vulture among geese, with his horses,[461] and lightly get away out of the Trojans’ confusion[462] and lightly charge in again in pursuit of a great multitude,[463] and yet could kill no men when he swept in in chase of them.[464] He had no way while he was alone in a separate chariot[465] to lunge with the spear and still keep in hand his fast-running horses.[466] But at last there was one of his companions who laid eyes upon him:[467] Alkimedon, the son of Laerkes, descended from Haimon.[468] He stood behind the chariot and called to Automedon:[469] “Automedon, what god put this unprofitable purpose[470] into your heart, and has taken away the better wits, so that[471] you are trying to fight the Trojans in the first shock of encounter[472] by yourself, since your companion has been killed, and Hektor[473] glories in wearing Aiakides’ armour on his own shoulders?”[474] In turn Automedon answered him, the son of Diores:[475] “Alkimedon, which other of the Achaians could handle[476] the management and the strength of immortal horses as you can,[477] were it not Patroklos, the equal of the immortals in counsel,[478] while he lived? Now death and fate have closed in upon him.[479] Therefore take over from me the whip and the glittering guide reins[480] while I dismount from behind the horses, so I may do battle.”[481] He spoke, and Alkimedon vaulted up to the charging chariot[482] and quickly gathered up the reins and the lash in his hands, while[483] Automedon sprang down. But glorious Hektor saw them[484] and immediately spoke to Aineias, who stood close beside him:[485] “Aineias, lord of the counsels of the bronze-armoured Trojans,[486] I see before us the horses of swift-footed Aiakides[487] who appear now in the fighting with weak charioteers. Therefore[488] I could be hopeful of their capture, if you were willing[489] in heart to go with me. If we two went forth against them[490] they would not dare to stand their ground and do battle against us.”[491] He spoke, and the strong son of Anchises did not disobey him.[492] The two went strongly forward, hooding their shoulders in well-tanned[493] and stubborn hides of oxen with deep bronze beaten upon them.[494] Along with these went Chromios and godlike Aretos[495] both together, and the spirit within each had high hopes[496] of killing the men and driving away the strong-necked horses;[497] poor fools, who were not going to come back from Automedon[498] without the shedding of blood; and he with a prayer to Zeus father[499] was filled about the darkening heart with war-strength and courage,[500] and spoke now to Alkimedon his trusted companion:[501] “Alkimedon, no longer check the horses back from me[502] but keep them breathing right against my back. I have no thought  p 216  [503] that I can stand up to the strength of Hektor the son of Priam.[504] Sooner, I think, he will kill us and mount behind the mane-floating[505] horses of Achilleus, and scatter the ranks of the Argive[506] fighting men; or else himself go down in the first rush.”[507] He spoke, and called to the two Aiantes and Menelaos:[508] “Aiantes, lords of the Argives, and Menelaos, we call you[509] to leave the dead man in the care of those who are fittest[510] to stand bestriding him and fend off the ranks of the Trojans[511] while you beat back the day without pity from us who are living.[512] For Hektor and Aineias, the greatest men of the Trojans,[513] are leaning the weight of their charge this way through the sorrowful battle.[514] Yet all these are things that are lying upon the gods’ knees.[515] I myself will cast; and Zeus will look after the issue.”[516] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,[517] and struck the shield of Aretos on its perfect circle,[518] nor could the shield hold off the spear, but the bronze smashed clean through[519] and was driven on through the belt to the deep of the belly.[520] As when a strong-grown man with sharp axe in his hands chops[521] at an ox, ranger of the fields, behind the horns, cutting[522] all the way through the sinew, and the ox springing forward topples,[523] so Aretos sprang forward, then toppled back, and sharp-driven[524] into the depth of his belly the quivering spear unstrung him.[525] Then Hektor made a cast with the shining spear at Automedon,[526] but he, keeping his eyes straight on him, avoided the bronze spear.[527] For he bent forward, and behind his back the long spearshaft[528] was driven into the ground so that the butt end was shaken[529] on the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took the force from it.[530] And now they would have gone for each other with swords at close quarters,[531] had not the two Aiantes driven strongly between them,[532] who came on through the battle at the call of their companion,[533] and in fear before them Hektor and Aineias and godlike[534] Chromios gave ground back and away once more, leaving[535] Aretos lying there where he was with a wound in his vitals.[536] Then Automedon, a match for the running god of battles,[537] stripped the armour, and spoke a word of boasting above him:[538] “Now I have put a little sorrow from my heart for Patroklos’[539] death, although the man I killed was not great as he was.”[540] So he spoke, and took up the bloody war spoils and laid them[541] inside the chariot, and himself mounted it, the blood running[542] from hands and feet, as on some lion who has eaten a bullock.[543] Once again over Patroklos was close drawn a strong battle[544] weary and sorrowful, and Athene from the sky descending[545] waked the bitter fighting, since Zeus of the wide brows sent her[546] down to stir the Danaans, for now his purpose had shifted.[547] As when in the sky Zeus strings for mortals the shimmering[548] rainbow, to be a portent and sign of war, or of wintry[549] storm, when heat perishes, such storm as stops mortals’[550] work upon the face of the earth, and afflicts their cattle,[551] so Athene shrouded in the shimmering cloud about her[552] merged among the swarming Achaians, and wakened each man.[553] And first she spoke, stirring him on, to the son of Atreus,  p 217  [554] strong Menelaos, since he was the one who was standing close to her.[555] She likened herself in form and weariless voice to Phoinix:[556] “Menelaos, this will be a thing of shame, a reproach said[557] of you, if under the wall of the Trojans the dogs in their fury[558] can mutilate the staunch companion of haughty Achilleus.[559] But hold strongly on, and stir up all the rest of your people.”[560] Then in turn Menelaos of the great war cry answered her:[561] “Phoinix, my father, aged and honoured, if only Athene[562] would give me such strength, and hold the volleying missiles off from me![563] So for my part I would be willing to stand by Patroklos[564] and defend him, since in his death he hurt my heart greatly.[565] Yet Hektor holds still the awful strength of a fire, nor falters[566] in raging with the bronze spear, since Zeus is giving him glory.”[567] So he spoke, and the goddess grey-eyed Athene was happy[568] that first among all the divinities his prayer had bespoken her.[569] She put strength into the man’s shoulders and knees, inspiring[570] in his breast the persistent daring of that mosquito[571] who though it is driven hard away from a man’s skin, even[572] so, for the taste of human blood, persists in biting him.[573] With such daring she darkened to fullness the heart inside him.[574] He stood over Patroklos, and made a cast with the shining[575] spear. There was one among the Trojans, Podes, Eëtion’s[576] son, a rich man and good, whom Hektor prized above others[577] in the countryside, since he was his friend and ate at his table.[578] Now fair-haired Menelaos struck this man, at the war belt[579] as he swept away in flight, and drove the bronze spear clean through it.[580] He fell, thunderously, and Atreus’ son Menelaos[581] dragged the body away from the Trojans among his companions.[582] But now Apollo came and stood beside Hektor, and stirred him,[583] assuming the shape of Phainops, Asios’ son, who among all[584] guest friends was dearest to Hektor, and lived at home in Abydos.[585] In the likeness of this man far-striking Apollo spoke to him:[586] “Hektor, what other Achaian now shall be frightened before you?[587] See, you have shrunk before Menelaos, who in times before this[588] was a soft spearfighter; and now he has gone taking off single-handed[589] a body from among the Trojans. He has killed your trusted companion,[590] valiant among the champions, Podes, the son of Eëtion.”[591] He spoke, and the dark cloud of sorrow closed over Hektor.[592] He took his way among the champions helmed in the shining[593] bronze. And now the son of Kronos caught up the betasselled[594] glaring aegis, and shrouded Ida in mists. He let go[595] a lightning flash and a loud thunderstroke, shaking the mountain,[596] gave victory to the Trojans, and terrified the Achaians.[597] First to begin the flight was Peneleos the Boiotian.[598] For he, turning always toward the attack, was hit in the shoulder’s[599] end, a slight wound, but the spear of Poulydamas, who had thrown it[600] from a stance very close to him, had grated the bone’s edge.[601] Then Hektor wounded in the hand by the wrist Leïtos,[602] the son of great-hearted Alektryon, and halted his warcraft,[603] and he drew back staring about him since his spirit had hope no longer[604] of holding a spear steady in his hand to fight with the Trojans.[605] Now as Hektor made a rush for Leïtos, Idomeneus  p 218  [606] struck him on the corselet over the chest by the nipple,[607] but the long shaft was broken behind the head, and the Trojans[608] shouted. Now Hektor made a cast at Deukalian Idomeneus[609] as he stood in his chariot, and missed him by only a little,[610] but struck the follower and charioteer of Meriones,[611] Koiranos, who had come with him from strong-founded Lyktos.[612] Now Idomeneus at the first had come on foot, leaving the oarswept[613] ships, and now would have given the Trojans a mighty triumph,[614] had not Koiranos swiftly come up with the fast-running horses;[615] came as light to the other and beat from him the day without pity,[616] but himself lost his life at the hands of manslaughtering Hektor,[617] who hit him under the jaw by the ear, and the spearshaft pushed out[618] his teeth by the roots from the base, and split the tongue through the middle.[619] He toppled from the chariot, with the reins on the ground scattered,[620] but Meriones leaning down caught these up in his own hands[621] from the surface of the plain, and called aloud to Idomeneus:[622] “Lash them now, until you can get back to our fast ships.[623] You see yourself there is no more strength left in the Achaians.”[624] So he spoke, and Idomeneus whipped the mane-floating horses[625] back to the hollow ships, with fear fallen upon his spirit.[626] Nor was it unseen by great-hearted Aias how Zeus shifted[627] the strength of the fighting toward the Trojans, nor by Menelaos.[628] First of the two to speak was huge Telamonian Aias:[629] “Shame on it! By now even one with a child’s innocence[630] could see how father Zeus himself is helping the Trojans.[631] The weapons of each of these take hold, no matter who throws them,[632] good fighter or bad, since Zeus is straightening all of them equally,[633] while ours fall to the ground and are utterly useless. Therefore[634] let us deliberate with ourselves upon the best counsel,[635] how at the same time to rescue the dead body, and also[636] win back ourselves, and bring joy to our beloved companions[637] who look our way and sorrow for us, and believe no longer[638] that the fury of manslaughtering Hektor, his hands irresistible,[639] can be held, but must be driven on to the black ships.[640] But there should be some companion who could carry the message[641] quickly to Peleus’ son, since I think he has not yet heard[642] the ghastly news, how his beloved companion has fallen.[643] Yet I cannot make out such a man among the Achaians,[644] since they are held in the mist alike, the men and their horses.[645] Father Zeus, draw free from the mist the sons of the Achaians,[646] make bright the air, and give sight back to our eyes; in shining[647] daylight destroy us, if to destroy us be now your pleasure.”[648] He spoke thus, and as he wept the father took pity upon him,[649] and forthwith scattered the mist and pushed the darkness back from them,[650] and the sun blazed out, and all the battle was plain before them.[651] Now Aias spoke to him of the great war cry, Menelaos:[652] “Look hard, illustrious Menelaos, if you can discover[653] Antilochos still living, the son of great-hearted Nestor,[654] and send him out to run with a message to wise Achilleus[655] how one who was far the dearest of his companions has fallen.”[656] He spoke, and Menelaos of the great war cry obeyed him,[657] and went on his way, as from a mid-fenced ground some lion  p 219  [658] who has been harrying dogs and men, but his strength is worn out;[659] they will not let him tear out the fat of the oxen, watching[660] nightlong against him, and he in his hunger for meat closes in[661] but can get nothing of what he wants, for the raining javelins[662] thrown from the daring hands of the men beat ever against him,[663] and the flaming torches, and these he balks at for all of his fury,[664] and with the daylight goes away, disappointed of desire;[665] so Menelaos of the great war cry went from Patroklos[666] much unwilling, and was afraid for him, lest the Achaians[667] under pressure of fear might leave him as spoil for the enemy,[668] and had much to urge on Meriones and the Aiantes:[669] “Aiantes, o lords of the Argives, and you, Meriones,[670] now let each one of you remember unhappy Patroklos[671] who was gentle, and understood how to be kindly toward all men[672] while he lived. Now death and fate have closed in upon him.”[673] So spoke fair-haired Menelaos, and went away from them[674] peering about on all sides, like an eagle, who, as men say,[675] sees most sharply of all winged creatures under the heaven,[676] and lofty though he hover the cowering hare, the swift-footed,[677] escapes not his sight as he crouches in the shaggy bush, but the eagle[678] plunges suddenly to grab him and tear the life from him.[679] So now in you, Menelaos, illustrious, the eyes shining[680] circled everywhere your swarming hordes of companions,[681] if the man might see anywhere Nestor’s son, still living,[682] and saw soon where he was, at the left of the entire battle,[683] encouraging his companions and urging them into the fighting.[684] Menelaos the fair-haired stood beside him and spoke to him:[685] “Antilochos, turn this way, illustrious, and hear from me[686] the ghastly message of a thing I wish never had happened.[687] You can see for yourself, I think, already, from watching,[688] how the god is wheeling disaster against the Danaans[689] and how the Trojans are winning. The best of the Achaians has fallen,[690] Patroklos, and a huge loss is inflicted upon the Danaans.[691] Run then quickly to Achilleus, by the ships of the Achaians,[692] and tell him. He might in speed win back to his ship the dead body[693] which is naked. Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.”[694] So he spoke, and Antilochos hated his word as he listened.[695] He stayed for a long time without a word, speechless, and his eyes[696] filled with tears, the springing voice was held still within him,[697] yet even so he neglected not Menelaos’ order[698] but went on the run, handing his war gear to a blameless companion,[699] Laodokos, who had turned nearby his single-foot horses.[700] Now as his feet carried him, weeping, out of the battle,[701] with his message of evil for the son of Peleus, Achilleus,[702] so now, Menelaos, the spirit in you, illustrious,[703] wished not to defend his stricken companions, after Antilochos[704] was gone from them, and his loss wrought greatly upon the Pylians;[705] rather he sent Thrasymedes the brilliant over to help them,[706] while he himself went back again to the hero Patroklos[707] running, and took his place beside the Aiantes, and spoke to them:[708] “Now I have sent the man you spoke of back to the fast ships[709] on his way to swift-footed Achilleus, yet think not even  p 220  [710] he can come now, for all his great anger with Hektor the brilliant.[711] There is no way he could fight bare of armour against the Trojans.[712] We by ourselves must deliberate upon the best counsel[713] how at the same time to rescue the dead body, and also[714] ourselves escape death and destiny from the clamouring Trojans.”[715] Then in turn huge Telamonian Aias answered him:[716] “All you have said, renowned Menelaos, is fair and orderly.[717] But come: you and Meriones stoop and shoulder the body[718] at once, and carry it out of the hard fighting. Behind you[719] we two shall fight off the Trojans and glorious Hektor,[720] we, who have the same name, the same spirit, and who in times past[721] have stood fast beside each other in the face of the bitter war god.”[722] He spoke, and they caught the body from ground in their arms, lifting[723] him high with a great heave, and the Trojan people behind them[724] shouted aloud as they saw the Achaians lifting the dead man,[725] and made a rush against them like dogs, who sweep in rapidly[726] on a wounded wild boar, ahead of the young men who hunt him,[727] and for the moment race in raging to tear him to pieces[728] until in the confidence of his strength he turns on them, at bay,[729] and they give ground and scatter for fear one way and another;[730] so the Trojans until that time kept always in close chase[731] assembled, stabbing at them with swords and leaf-headed spears,[732] but every time the two Aiantes would swing round to face them[733] and stand fast, the colour of their skin changed, and no longer[734] could any endure to sweep in further and fight for the body.[735] So these, straining, carried the dead man out of the battle[736] and back to the hollow ships, and the fight that was drawn fast between them[737] was wild as fire which, risen suddenly, storming a city[738] of men sets it ablaze, and houses diminish before it[739] in the high glare, and the force of the wind on it roars it to thunder;[740] so, as the Danaans made their way back, the weariless roaring[741] of horses, chariots, and spearmen was ever upon them.[742] But they, as mules who have put the on-drive of strength upon them[743] drag down from the high ground along a steep stony trail either[744] a beam or some big timber for a ship, and the heart in them[745] wearies under the hard work and sweat of their urgent endeavour;[746] so these, straining, carried the dead man away, and behind them[747] the two Aiantes held them off, as a timbered rock ridge[748] holds off water, one that is placed to divide an entire plain,[749] which, though flood-currents of strong rivers drive sorely against it,[750] holds them off and beats back the waters of them all to be scattered[751] over the plain, and all the strength of their streams cannot break it;[752] so behind the Achaians the Aiantes held off forever[753] the Trojan attack. But these stayed close, and two beyond others,[754] Aineias, who was son of Anchises, and glorious Hektor.[755] But before these, as goes a cloud of daws or of starlings[756] screaming terror when they have seen coming forth against them[757] the hawk, whose coming is murder for the little birds, so now[758] before Aineias and Hektor the young Achaian warriors[759] went, screaming terror, all the delight of battle forgotten.  p 221  [760] Many fine pieces of armour littered the ground on both sides[761] of the ditch, as the Danaans fled. There was no check in the fighting.book eighteen[1] So these fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. Meanwhile,[2] Antilochos came, a swift-footed messenger, to Achilleus,[3] and found him sitting in front of the steep-horned ships, thinking[4] over in his heart of things which had now been accomplished.[5] Disturbed, Achilleus spoke to the spirit in his own great heart:[6] “Ah me, how is it that once again the flowing-haired Achaians[7] are driven out of the plain on their ships in fear and confusion?[8] May the gods not accomplish vile sorrows upon the heart in me[9] in the way my mother once made it clear to me, when she told me[10] how while I yet lived the bravest of all the Myrmidons[11] must leave the light of the sun beneath the hands of the Trojans.[12] Surely, then, the strong son of Menoitios has perished.[13] Unhappy! and yet I told him, once he had beaten the fierce fire[14] off, to come back to the ships, not fight in strength against Hektor.”[15] Now as he was pondering this in his heart and his spirit,[16] meanwhile the son of stately Nestor was drawing near him[17] and wept warm tears, and gave Achilleus his sorrowful message:[18] “Ah me, son of valiant Peleus; you must hear from me[19] the ghastly message of a thing I wish never had happened.[20] Patroklos has fallen, and now they are fighting over his body[21] which is naked. Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.”[22] He spoke, and the black cloud of sorrow closed on Achilleus.[23] In both hands he caught up the grimy dust, and poured it[24] over his head and face, and fouled his handsome countenance,[25] and the black ashes were scattered over his immortal tunic.[26] And he himself, mightily in his might, in the dust lay[27] at length, and took and tore at his hair with his hands, and defiled it.[28] And the handmaidens Achilleus and Patroklos had taken[29] captive, stricken at heart cried out aloud, and came running[30] out of doors about valiant Achilleus, and all of them[31] beat their breasts with their hands, and the limbs went slack in each of them.[32] On the other side Antilochos mourned with him, letting the tears fall,[33] and held the hands of Achilleus as he grieved in his proud heart,[34] fearing Achilleus might cut his throat with the iron. He cried out[35] terribly, aloud, and the lady his mother heard him[36] as she sat in the depths of the sea at the side of her aged father,[37] and she cried shrill in turn, and the goddesses gathered about her,[38] all who along the depth of the sea were daughters of Nereus.[39] For Glauke was there, Kymodoke and Thaleia,[40] Nesaie and Speio and Thoë, and ox-eyed Halia;[41] Kymothoë was there, Aktaia and Limnoreia,[42] Melite and Iaira, Amphithoë and Agauë,[43] Doto and Proto, Dynamene and Pherousa,[44] Dexamene and Amphinome and Kallianeira;[45] Doris and Panope and glorious Galateia,  p 222  [46] Nemertes and Apseudes and Kallianassa;[47] Klymene was there, Ianeira and Ianassa,[48] Maira and Oreithyia and lovely-haired Amatheia,[49] and the rest who along the depth of the sea were daughters of Nereus.[50] The silvery cave was filled with these, and together all of them[51] beat their breasts, and among them Thetis led out the threnody:[52] “Hear me, Nereids, my sisters; so you may all know[53] well all the sorrows that are in my heart, when you hear of them from me.[54] Ah me, my sorrow, the bitterness in this best of child-bearing,[55] since I gave birth to a son who was without fault and powerful,[56] conspicuous among heroes; and he shot up like a young tree,[57] and I nurtured him, like a tree grown in the pride of the orchard.[58] I sent him away with the curved ships into the land of Ilion[59] to fight with the Trojans; but I shall never again receive him[60] won home again to his country and into the house of Peleus.[61] Yet while I see him live and he looks on the sunlight, he has[62] sorrows, and though I go to him I can do nothing to help him.[63] Yet I shall go, to look on my dear son, and to listen[64] to the sorrow that has come to him as he stays back from the fighting.”[65] So she spoke, and left the cave, and the others together[66] went with her in tears, and about them the wave of the water[67] was broken. Now these, when they came to the generous Troad,[68] followed each other out on the sea-shore, where close together[69] the ships of the Myrmidons were hauled up about swift Achilleus.[70] There as he sighed heavily the lady his mother stood by him[71] and cried out shrill and aloud, and took her son’s head in her arms, then[72] sorrowing for him she spoke to him in winged words: “Why then,[73] child, do you lament? What sorrow has come to your heart now?[74] Speak out, do not hide it. These things are brought to accomplishment[75] through Zeus: in the way that you lifted your hands and prayed for,[76] that all the sons of the Achaians be pinned on their grounded vessels[77] by reason of your loss, and suffer things that are shameful.”[78] Then sighing heavily Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:[79] “My mother, all these things the Olympian brought to accomplishment.[80] But what pleasure is this to me, since my dear companion has perished,[81] Patroklos, whom I loved beyond all other companions,[82] as well as my own life. I have lost him, and Hektor, who killed him,[83] has stripped away that gigantic armour, a wonder to look on[84] and splendid, which the gods gave Peleus, a glorious present,[85] on that day they drove you to the marriage bed of a mortal.[86] I wish you had gone on living then with the other goddesses[87] of the sea, and that Peleus had married some mortal woman.[88] As it is, there must be on your heart a numberless sorrow[89] for your son’s death, since you can never again receive him[90] won home again to his country; since the spirit within does not drive me[91] to go on living and be among men, except on condition[92] that Hektor first be beaten down under my spear, lose his life[93] and pay the price for stripping Patroklos, the son of Menoitios.”[94] Then in turn Thetis spoke to him, letting the tears fall:[95] “Then I must lose you soon, my child, by what you are saying,[96] since it is decreed your death must come soon after Hektor’s.”[97] Then deeply disturbed Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:  p 223  [98] “I must die soon, then; since I was not to stand by my companion[99] when he was killed. And now, far away from the land of his fathers,[100] he has perished, and lacked my fighting strength to defend him.[101] Now, since I am not going back to the beloved land of my fathers,[102] since I was no light of safety to Patroklos, nor to my other[103] companions, who in their numbers went down before glorious Hektor,[104] but sit here beside my ships, a useless weight on the good land,[105] I, who am such as no other of the bronze-armoured Achaians[106] in battle, though there are others also better in council—[107] why, I wish that strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals,[108] and gall, which makes a man grow angry for all his great mind,[109] that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man’s heart[110] and becomes a thing sweeter to him by far than the dripping of honey.[111] So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.[112] Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our[113] sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.[114] Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,[115] Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever[116] time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.[117] For not even the strength of Herakles fled away from destruction,[118] although he was dearest of all to lord Zeus, son of Kronos,[119] but his fate beat him under, and the wearisome anger of Hera.[120] So I likewise, if such is the fate which has been wrought for me,[121] shall lie still, when I am dead. Now I must win excellent glory,[122] and drive some one of the women of Troy, or some deep-girdled[123] Dardanian woman, lifting up to her soft cheeks both hands[124] to wipe away the close bursts of tears in her lamentation,[125] and learn that I stayed too long out of the fighting. Do not[126] hold me back from the fight, though you love me. You will not persuade me.”[127] In turn the goddess Thetis of the silver feet answered him:[128] “Yes, it is true, my child, this is no cowardly action,[129] to beat aside sudden death from your afflicted companions.[130] Yet, see now, your splendid armour, glaring and brazen,[131] is held among the Trojans, and Hektor of the shining helmet[132] wears it on his own shoulders, and glories in it. Yet I think[133] he will not glory for long, since his death stands very close to him.[134] Therefore do not yet go into the grind of the war god,[135] not before with your own eyes you see me come back to you.[136] For I am coming to you at dawn and as the sun rises[137] bringing splendid armour to you from the lord Hephaistos.”[138] So she spoke, and turned, and went away from her son,[139] and turning now to her sisters of the sea she spoke to them:[140] “Do you now go back into the wide fold of the water[141] to visit the ancient of the sea and the house of our father,[142] and tell him everything. I am going to tall Olympos[143] and to Hephaistos, the glorious smith, if he might be willing[144] to give me for my son renowned and radiant armour.”[145] She spoke, and they plunged back beneath the wave of the water,[146] while she the goddess Thetis of the silver feet went onward[147] to Olympos, to bring back to her son the glorious armour.[148] So her feet carried her to Olympos; meanwhile the Achaians  p 224  [149] with inhuman clamour before the attack of manslaughtering Hektor[150] fled until they were making for their own ships and the Hellespont;[151] nor could the strong-greaved Achaians have dragged the body[152] of Patroklos, henchman of Achilleus, from under the missiles,[153] for once again the men and the horses came over upon him,[154] and Hektor, Priam’s son, who fought like a flame in his fury.[155] Three times from behind glorious Hektor caught him[156] by the feet, trying to drag him, and called aloud on the Trojans.[157] Three times the two Aiantes with their battle-fury upon them[158] beat him from the corpse, but he, steady in the confidence of his great strength,[159] kept making, now a rush into the crowd, or again at another time[160] stood fast, with his great cry, but gave not a bit of ground backward.[161] And as herdsmen who dwell in the fields are not able to frighten[162] a tawny lion in his great hunger away from a carcass,[163] so the two Aiantes, marshals of men, were not able[164] to scare Hektor, Priam’s son, away from the body.[165] And now he would have dragged it away and won glory forever[166] had not swift wind-footed Iris come running from Olympos[167] with a message for Peleus’ son to arm. She came secretly[168] from Zeus and the other gods, since it was Hera who sent her.[169] She came and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:[170] “Rise up, son of Peleus, most terrifying of all men.[171] Defend Patroklos, for whose sake the terrible fighting[172] stands now in front of the ships. They are destroying each other;[173] the Achaians fight in defence over the fallen body[174] while the others, the Trojans, are rushing to drag the corpse off[175] to windy Ilion, and beyond all glorious Hektor[176] rages to haul it away, since the anger within him is urgent[177] to cut the head from the soft neck and set it on sharp stakes.[178] Up, then, lie here no longer; let shame come into your heart, lest[179] Patroklos become sport for the dogs of Troy to worry,[180] your shame, if the body goes from here with defilement upon it.”[181] Then in turn Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:[182] “Divine Iris, what god sent you to me with a message?”[183] Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris spoke to him:[184] “Hera sent me, the honoured wife of Zeus; but the son of[185] Kronos, who sits on high, does not know this, nor any other[186] immortal, of all those who dwell by the snows of Olympos.”[187] Then in answer to her spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[188] “How shall I go into the fighting? They have my armour.[189] And my beloved mother told me I must not be armoured,[190] not before with my own eyes I see her come back to me.[191] She promised she would bring magnificent arms from Hephaistos.[192] Nor do I know of another whose glorious armour I could wear[193] unless it were the great shield of Telamonian Aias.[194] But he himself wears it, I think, and goes in the foremost[195] of the spear-fight over the body of fallen Patroklos.”[196] Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris spoke to him:[197] “Yes, we also know well how they hold your glorious armour.[198] But go to the ditch, and show yourself as you are to the Trojans,[199] if perhaps the Trojans might be frightened, and give way  p 225  [200] from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind[201] again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.”[202] So speaking Iris of the swift feet went away from him;[203] but Achilleus, the beloved of Zeus, rose up, and Athene[204] swept about his powerful shoulders the fluttering aegis;[205] and she, the divine among goddesses, about his head circled[206] a golden cloud, and kindled from it a flame far-shining.[207] As when a flare goes up into the high air from a city[208] from an island far away, with enemies fighting about it[209] who all day long are in the hateful division of Ares[210] fighting from their own city, but as the sun goes down signal[211] fires blaze out one after another, so that the glare goes[212] pulsing high for men of the neighbouring islands to see it,[213] in case they might come over in ships to beat off the enemy;[214] so from the head of Achilleus the blaze shot into the bright air.[215] He went from the wall and stood by the ditch, nor mixed with the other[216] Achaians, since he followed the close command of his mother.[217] There he stood, and shouted, and from her place Pallas Athene[218] gave cry, and drove an endless terror upon the Trojans.[219] As loud as comes the voice that is screamed out by a trumpet[220] by murderous attackers who beleaguer a city,[221] so then high and clear went up the voice of Aiakides.[222] But the Trojans, when they heard the brazen voice of Aiakides,[223] the heart was shaken in all, and the very floating-maned horses[224] turned their chariots about, since their hearts saw the coming afflictions.[225] The charioteers were dumbfounded as they saw the unwearied dangerous[226] fire that played above the head of great-hearted Peleion[227] blazing, and kindled by the goddess grey-eyed Athene.[228] Three times across the ditch brilliant Achilleus gave his great cry,[229] and three times the Trojans and their renowned companions were routed.[230] There at that time twelve of the best men among them perished[231] upon their own chariots and spears. Meanwhile the Achaians[232] gladly pulled Patroklos out from under the missiles[233] and set him upon a litter, and his own companions about him[234] stood mourning, and along with them swift-footed Achilleus[235] went, letting fall warm tears as he saw his steadfast companion[236] lying there on a carried litter and torn with the sharp bronze,[237] the man he had sent off before with horses and chariot[238] into the fighting; who never again came home to be welcomed.[239] Now the lady Hera of the ox eyes drove the unwilling[240] weariless sun god to sink in the depth of the Ocean,[241] and the sun went down, and the brilliant Achaians gave over[242] their strong fighting, and the doubtful collision of battle.[243] The Trojans on the other side moved from the strong encounter[244] in their turn, and unyoked their running horses from under the chariots,[245] and gathered into assembly before taking thought for their supper.[246] They stood on their feet in assembly, nor did any man have the patience[247] to sit down, but the terror was on them all, seeing that Achilleus[248] had appeared, after he had stayed so long from the difficult fighting.[249] First to speak among them was the careful Poulydamas,[250] Panthoös’ son, who alone of them looked before and behind him.[251] He was companion to Hektor, and born on the same night with him,  p 226  [252] but he was better in words, the other with the spear far better.[253] He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:[254] “Now take careful thought, dear friends; for I myself urge you[255] to go back into the city and not wait for the divine dawn[256] in the plain beside the ships. We are too far from the wall now.[257] While this man was still angry with great Agamemnon,[258] for all that time the Achaians were easier men to fight with.[259] For I also used then to be one who was glad to sleep out[260] near their ships, and I hoped to capture the oarswept vessels.[261] But now I terribly dread the swift-footed son of Peleus.[262] So violent is the valour in him, he will not be willing[263] to stay here in the plain, where now Achaians and Trojans[264] from either side sunder between them the wrath of the war god.[265] With him, the fight will be for the sake of our city and women.[266] Let us go into the town; believe me; thus it will happen.[267] For this present, immortal night has stopped the swift-footed[268] son of Peleus, but if he catches us still in this place[269] tomorrow, and drives upon us in arms, a man will be well[270] aware of him, be glad to get back into sacred Ilion,[271] the man who escapes; there will be many Trojans the vultures[272] and dogs will feed on. But let such a word be out of my hearing![273] If all of us will do as I say, though it hurts us to do it,[274] this night we will hold our strength in the market place, and the great walls[275] and the gateways, and the long, smooth-planed, close-joined gate timbers[276] that close to fit them shall defend our city. Then, early[277] in the morning, under dawn, we shall arm ourselves in our war gear[278] and take stations along the walls. The worse for him, if he endeavours[279] to come away from the ships and fight us here for our city.[280] Back he must go to his ships again, when he wears out the strong necks[281] of his horses, driving them at a gallop everywhere by the city.[282] His valour will not give him leave to burst in upon us[283] nor sack our town. Sooner the circling dogs will feed on him.”[284] Then looking darkly at him Hektor of the shining helm spoke:[285] “Poulydamas, these things that you argue please me no longer[286] when you tell us to go back again and be cooped in our city.[287] Have you not all had your glut of being fenced in our outworks?[288] There was a time when mortal men would speak of the city[289] of Priam as a place with much gold and much bronze. But now[290] the lovely treasures that lay away in our houses have vanished,[291] and many possessions have been sold and gone into Phrygia[292] and into Maionia the lovely, when great Zeus was angry.[293] But now, when the son of devious-devising Kronos has given[294] me the winning of glory by the ships, to pin the Achaians[295] on the sea, why, fool, no longer show these thoughts to our people.[296] Not one of the Trojans will obey you. I shall not allow it.[297] Come, then, do as I say and let us all be persuaded.[298] Now, take your supper by positions along the encampment,[299] and do not forget your watch, and let every man be wakeful.[300] And if any Trojan is strongly concerned about his possessions,[301] let him gather them and give them to the people, to use them in common.[302] It is better for one of us to enjoy them than for the Achaians.[303] In the morning, under dawn, we shall arm ourselves in our war gear  p 227  [304] and waken the bitter god of war by the hollow vessels.[305] If it is true that brilliant Achilleus is risen beside their[306] ships, then the worse for him if he tries it, since I for my part[307] will not run from him out of the sorrowful battle, but rather[308] stand fast, to see if he wins the great glory, or if I can win it.[309] The war god is impartial. Before now he has killed the killer.”[310] So spoke Hektor, and the Trojans thundered to hear him;[311] fools, since Pallas Athene had taken away the wits from them.[312] They gave their applause to Hektor in his counsel of evil,[313] but none to Poulydamas, who had spoken good sense before them.[314] They took their supper along the encampment. Meanwhile the Achaians[315] mourned all night in lamentation over Patroklos.[316] Peleus’ son led the thronging chant of their lamentation,[317] and laid his manslaughtering hands over the chest of his dear friend[318] with outbursts of incessant grief. As some great bearded lion[319] when some man, a deer hunter, has stolen his cubs away from him[320] out of the close wood; the lion comes back too late, and is anguished,[321] and turns into many valleys quartering after the man’s trail[322] on the chance of finding him, and taken with bitter anger;[323] so he, groaning heavily, spoke out to the Myrmidons:[324] “Ah me. It was an empty word I cast forth on that day[325] when in his halls I tried to comfort the hero Menoitios.[326] I told him I would bring back his son in glory to Opous[327] with Ilion sacked, and bringing his share of war spoils allotted.[328] But Zeus does not bring to accomplishment all thoughts in men’s minds.[329] Thus it is destiny for us both to stain the same soil[330] here in Troy; since I shall never come home, and my father,[331] Peleus the aged rider, will not welcome me in his great house,[332] nor Thetis my mother, but in this place the earth will receive me.[333] But seeing that it is I, Patroklos, who follow you underground,[334] I will not bury you till I bring to this place the armour[335] and the head of Hektor, since he was your great-hearted murderer.[336] Before your burning pyre I shall behead twelve glorious[337] children of the Trojans, for my anger over your slaying.[338] Until then, you shall lie where you are in front of my curved ships[339] and beside you women of Troy and deep-girdled Dardanian women[340] shall sorrow for you night and day and shed tears for you, those whom[341] you and I worked hard to capture by force and the long spear[342] in days when we were storming the rich cities of mortals.”[343] So speaking brilliant Achilleus gave orders to his companions[344] to set a great cauldron across the fire, so that with all speed[345] they could wash away the clotted blood from Patroklos.[346] They set up over the blaze of the fire a bath-water cauldron[347] and poured water into it and put logs underneath and kindled them.[348] The fire worked on the swell of the cauldron, and the water heated.[349] But when the water had come to a boil in the shining bronze, then[350] they washed the body and anointed it softly with olive oil[351] and stopped the gashes in his body with stored-up unguents[352] and laid him on a bed, and shrouded him in a thin sheet[353] from head to foot, and covered that over with a white mantle.[354] Then all night long, gathered about Achilleus of the swift feet,[355] the Myrmidons mourned for Patroklos and lamented over him.  p 228  [356] But Zeus spoke to Hera, who was his wife and his sister:[357] “So you have acted, then, lady Hera of the ox eyes.[358] You have roused up Achilleus of the swift feet. It must be then[359] that the flowing-haired Achaians are born of your own generation.”[360] Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered him:[361] “Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?[362] Even one who is mortal will try to accomplish his purpose[363] for another, though he be a man and knows not such wisdom as we do.[364] As for me then, who claim I am highest of all the goddesses,[365] both ways, since I am eldest born and am called your consort,[366] yours, and you in turn are lord over all the immortals,[367] how could I not weave sorrows for the men of Troy, when I hate them?”[368] Now as these two were saying things like this to each other,[369] Thetis of the silver feet came to the house of Hephaistos,[370] imperishable, starry, and shining among the immortals,[371] built in bronze for himself by the god of the dragging footsteps.[372] She found him sweating as he turned here and there to his bellows[373] busily, since he was working on twenty tripods[374] which were to stand against the wall of his strong-founded dwelling.[375] And he had set golden wheels underneath the base of each one[376] so that of their own motion they could wheel into the immortal[377] gathering, and return to his house: a wonder to look at.[378] These were so far finished, but the elaborate ear handles[379] were not yet on. He was forging these, and beating the chains out.[380] As he was at work on this in his craftsmanship and his cunning[381] meanwhile the goddess Thetis the silver-footed drew near him.[382] Charis of the shining veil saw her as she came forward,[383] she, the lovely goddess the renowned strong-armed one had married.[384] She came, and caught her hand and called her by name and spoke to her:[385] “Why is it, Thetis of the light robes, you have come to our house now?[386] We honour you and love you; but you have not come much before this.[387] But come in with me, so I may put entertainment before you.”[388] She spoke, and, shining among divinities, led the way forward[389] and made Thetis sit down in a chair that was wrought elaborately[390] and splendid with silver nails, and under it was a footstool.[391] She called to Hephaistos the renowned smith and spoke a word to him:[392] “Hephaistos, come this way; here is Thetis, who has need of you.”[393] Hearing her the renowned smith of the strong arms answered her:[394] “Then there is a goddess we honour and respect in our house.[395] She saved me when I suffered much at the time of my great fall[396] through the will of my own brazen-faced mother, who wanted[397] to hide me, for being lame. Then my soul would have taken much suffering[398] had not Eurynome and Thetis caught me and held me,[399] Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, whose stream bends back in a circle.[400] With them I worked nine years as a smith, and wrought many intricate[401] things; pins that bend back, curved clasps, cups, necklaces, working[402] there in the hollow of the cave, and the stream of Ocean around us[403] went on forever with its foam and its murmur. No other[404] among the gods or among mortal men knew about us[405] except Eurynome and Thetis. They knew, since they saved me.[406] Now she has come into our house; so I must by all means[407] do everything to give recompense to lovely-haired Thetis  p 229  [408] for my life. Therefore set out before her fair entertainment[409] while I am putting away my bellows and all my instruments.”[410] He spoke, and took the huge blower off from the block of the anvil[411] limping; and yet his shrunken legs moved lightly beneath him.[412] He set the bellows away from the fire, and gathered and put away[413] all the tools with which he worked in a silver strongbox.[414] Then with a sponge he wiped clean his forehead, and both hands,[415] and his massive neck and hairy chest, and put on a tunic,[416] and took up a heavy stick in his hand, and went to the doorway[417] limping. And in support of their master moved his attendants.[418] These are golden, and in appearance like living young women.[419] There is intelligence in their hearts, and there is speech in them[420] and strength, and from the immortal gods they have learned how to do things.[421] These stirred nimbly in support of their master, and moving[422] near to where Thetis sat in her shining chair, Hephaistos[423] caught her by the hand and called her by name and spoke a word to her:[424] “Why is it, Thetis of the light robes, you have come to our house now?[425] We honour you and love you; but you have not come much before this.[426] Speak forth what is in your mind. My heart is urgent to do it[427] if I can, and if it is a thing that can be accomplished.”[428] Then in turn Thetis answered him, letting the tears fall:[429] “Hephaistos, is there among all the goddesses on Olympos[430] one who in her heart has endured so many grim sorrows[431] as the griefs Zeus, son of Kronos, has given me beyond others?[432] Of all other sisters of the sea he gave me to a mortal,[433] to Peleus, Aiakos’ son, and I had to endure mortal marriage[434] though much against my will. And now he, broken by mournful[435] old age, lies away in his halls. Yet I have other troubles.[436] For since he has given me a son to bear and to raise up[437] conspicuous among heroes, and he shot up like a young tree,[438] I nurtured him, like a tree grown in the pride of the orchard.[439] I sent him away in the curved ships to the land of Ilion[440] to fight with the Trojans; but I shall never again receive him[441] won home again to his country and into the house of Peleus.[442] Yet while I see him live and he looks on the sunlight, he has[443] sorrows, and though I go to him I can do nothing to help him.[444] And the girl the sons of the Achaians chose out for his honour[445] powerful Agamemnon took her away again out of his hands.[446] For her his heart has been wasting in sorrow; but meanwhile the Trojans[447] pinned the Achaians against their grounded ships, and would not[448] let them win outside, and the elders of the Argives entreated[449] my son, and named the many glorious gifts they would give him.[450] But at that time he refused himself to fight the death from them;[451] nevertheless he put his own armour upon Patroklos[452] and sent him into the fighting, and gave many men to go with him.[453] All day they fought about the Skaian Gates, and on that day[454] they would have stormed the city, if only Phoibos Apollo[455] had not killed the fighting son of Menoitios there in the first ranks[456] after he had wrought much damage, and given the glory to Hektor.[457] Therefore now I come to your knees; so might you be willing[458] to give me for my short-lived son a shield and a helmet  p 230  [459] and two beautiful greaves fitted with clasps for the ankles[460] and a corselet. What he had was lost with his steadfast companion[461] when the Trojans killed him. Now my son lies on the ground, heart sorrowing.”[462] Hearing her the renowned smith of the strong arms answered her:[463] “Do not fear. Let not these things be a thought in your mind.[464] And I wish that I could hide him away from death and its sorrow[465] at that time when his hard fate comes upon him, as surely[466] as there shall be fine armour for him, such as another[467] man out of many men shall wonder at, when he looks on it.”[468] So he spoke, and left her there, and went to his bellows.[469] He turned these toward the fire and gave them their orders for working.[470] And the bellows, all twenty of them, blew on the crucibles,[471] from all directions blasting forth wind to blow the flames high[472] now as he hurried to be at this place and now at another,[473] wherever Hephaistos might wish them to blow, and the work went forward.[474] He cast on the fire bronze which is weariless, and tin with it[475] and valuable gold, and silver, and thereafter set forth[476] upon its standard the great anvil, and gripped in one hand[477] the ponderous hammer, while in the other he grasped the pincers.[478] First of all he forged a shield that was huge and heavy,[479] elaborating it about, and threw around it a shining[480] triple rim that glittered, and the shield strap was cast of silver.[481] There were five folds composing the shield itself, and upon it[482] he elaborated many things in his skill and craftsmanship.[483] He made the earth upon it, and the sky, and the sea’s water,[484] and the tireless sun, and the moon waxing into her fullness,[485] and on it all the constellations that festoon the heavens,[486] the Pleiades and the Hyades and the strength of Orion[487] and the Bear, whom men give also the name of the Wagon,[488] who turns about in a fixed place and looks at Orion[489] and she alone is never plunged in the wash of the Ocean.[490] On it he wrought in all their beauty two cities of mortal[491] men. And there were marriages in one, and festivals.[492] They were leading the brides along the city from their maiden chambers[493] under the flaring of torches, and the loud bride song was arising.[494] The young men followed the circles of the dance, and among them[495] the flutes and lyres kept up their clamour as in the meantime[496] the women standing each at the door of her court admired them.[497] The people were assembled in the market place, where a quarrel[498] had arisen, and two men were disputing over the blood price[499] for a man who had been killed. One man promised full restitution[500] in a public statement, but the other refused and would accept nothing.[501] Both then made for an arbitrator, to have a decision;[502] and people were speaking up on either side, to help both men.[503] But the heralds kept the people in hand, as meanwhile the elders[504] were in session on benches of polished stone in the sacred circle[505] and held in their hands the staves of the heralds who lift their voices.[506] The two men rushed before these, and took turns speaking their cases,[507] and between them lay on the ground two talents of gold, to be given[508] to that judge who in this case spoke the straightest opinion.  p 231  [509] But around the other city were lying two forces of armed men[510] shining in their war gear. For one side counsel was divided[511] whether to storm and sack, or share between both sides the property[512] and all the possessions the lovely citadel held hard within it.[513] But the city’s people were not giving way, and armed for an ambush.[514] Their beloved wives and their little children stood on the rampart[515] to hold it, and with them the men with age upon them, but meanwhile[516] the others went out. And Ares led them, and Pallas Athene.[517] These were gold, both, and golden raiment upon them, and they were[518] beautiful and huge in their armour, being divinities,[519] and conspicuous from afar, but the people around them were smaller.[520] These, when they were come to the place that was set for their ambush,[521] in a river, where there was a watering place for all animals,[522] there they sat down in a place shrouding themselves in the bright bronze.[523] But apart from these were sitting two men to watch for the rest of them[524] and waiting until they could see the sheep and the shambling cattle,[525] who appeared presently, and two herdsmen went along with them[526] playing happily on pipes, and took no thought of the treachery.[527] Those others saw them, and made a rush, and quickly thereafter[528] cut off on both sides the herds of cattle and the beautiful[529] flocks of shining sheep, and killed the shepherds upon them.[530] But the other army, as soon as they heard the uproar arising[531] from the cattle, as they sat in their councils, suddenly mounted[532] behind their light-foot horses, and went after, and soon overtook them.[533] These stood their ground and fought a battle by the banks of the river,[534] and they were making casts at each other with their spears bronze-headed;[535] and Hate was there with Confusion among them, and Death the destructive;[536] she was holding a live man with a new wound, and another[537] one unhurt, and dragged a dead man by the feet through the carnage.[538] The clothing upon her shoulders showed strong red with the men’s blood.[539] All closed together like living men and fought with each other[540] and dragged away from each other the corpses of those who had fallen.[541] He made upon it a soft field, the pride of the tilled land,[542] wide and triple-ploughed, with many ploughmen upon it[543] who wheeled their teams at the turn and drove them in either direction.[544] And as these making their turn would reach the end-strip of the field,[545] a man would come up to them at this point and hand them a flagon[546] of honey-sweet wine, and they would turn again to the furrows[547] in their haste to come again to the end-strip of the deep field.[548] The earth darkened behind them and looked like earth that has been ploughed[549] though it was gold. Such was the wonder of the shield’s forging.[550] He made on it the precinct of a king, where the labourers[551] were reaping, with the sharp reaping hooks in their hands. Of the cut swathes[552] some fell along the lines of reaping, one after another,[553] while the sheaf-binders caught up others and tied them with bind-ropes.[554] There were three sheaf-binders who stood by, and behind them[555] were children picking up the cut swathes, and filled their arms with them[556] and carried and gave them always; and by them the king in silence[557] and holding his staff stood near the line of the reapers, happily.  p 232  [558] And apart and under a tree the heralds made a feast ready[559] and trimmed a great ox they had slaughtered. Meanwhile the women[560] scattered, for the workmen to eat, abundant white barley.[561] He made on it a great vineyard heavy with clusters,[562] lovely and in gold, but the grapes upon it were darkened[563] and the vines themselves stood out through poles of silver. About them[564] he made a field-ditch of dark metal, and drove all around this[565] a fence of tin; and there was only one path to the vineyard,[566] and along it ran the grape-bearers for the vineyard’s stripping.[567] Young girls and young men, in all their light-hearted innocence,[568] carried the kind, sweet fruit away in their woven baskets,[569] and in their midst a youth with a singing lyre played charmingly[570] upon it for them, and sang the beautiful song for Linos[571] in a light voice, and they followed him, and with singing and whistling[572] and light dance-steps of their feet kept time to the music.[573] He made upon it a herd of horn-straight oxen. The cattle[574] were wrought of gold and of tin, and thronged in speed and with lowing[575] out of the dung of the farmyard to a pasturing place by a sounding[576] river, and beside the moving field of a reed bed.[577] The herdsmen were of gold who went along with the cattle,[578] four of them, and nine dogs shifting their feet followed them.[579] But among the foremost of the cattle two formidable lions[580] had caught hold of a bellowing bull, and he with loud lowings[581] was dragged away, as the dogs and the young men went in pursuit of him.[582] But the two lions, breaking open the hide of the great ox,[583] gulped the black blood and the inward guts, as meanwhile the herdsmen[584] were in the act of setting and urging the quick dogs on them.[585] But they, before they could get their teeth in, turned back from the lions,[586] but would come and take their stand very close, and bayed, and kept clear.[587] And the renowned smith of the strong arms made on it a meadow[588] large and in a lovely valley for the glimmering sheepflocks,[589] with dwelling places upon it, and covered shelters, and sheepfolds.[590] And the renowned smith of the strong arms made elaborate on it[591] a dancing floor, like that which once in the wide spaces of Knosos[592] Daidalos built for Ariadne of the lovely tresses.[593] And there were young men on it and young girls, sought for their beauty[594] with gifts of oxen, dancing, and holding hands at the wrist. These[595] wore, the maidens long light robes, but the men wore tunics[596] of finespun work and shining softly, touched with olive oil.[597] And the girls wore fair garlands on their heads, while the young men[598] carried golden knives that hung from sword-belts of silver.[599] At whiles on their understanding feet they would run very lightly,[600] as when a potter crouching makes trial of his wheel, holding[601] it close in his hands, to see if it will run smooth. At another[602] time they would form rows, and run, rows crossing each other.[603] And around the lovely chorus of dancers stood a great multitude[604] happily watching, while among the dancers two acrobats[605] led the measures of song and dance revolving among them.[606] He made on it the great strength of the Ocean River[607] which ran around the uttermost rim of the shield’s strong structure.[608] Then after he had wrought this shield, which was huge and heavy,[609] he wrought for him a corselet brighter than fire in its shining,  p 233  [610] and wrought him a helmet, massive and fitting close to his temples,[611] lovely and intricate work, and laid a gold top-ridge along it,[612] and out of pliable tin wrought him leg-armour. Thereafter[613] when the renowned smith of the strong arms had finished the armour[614] he lifted it and laid it before the mother of Achilleus.[615] And she like a hawk came sweeping down from the snows of Olympos[616] and carried with her the shining armour, the gift of Hephaistos.book nineteen[1] Now Dawn the yellow-robed arose from the river of Ocean[2] to carry her light to men and to immortals. And Thetis[3] came to the ships and carried with her the gifts of Hephaistos.[4] She found her beloved son lying in the arms of Patroklos[5] crying shrill, and his companions in their numbers about him[6] mourned. She, shining among divinities, stood there beside them.[7] She clung to her son’s hand and called him by name and spoke to him:[8] “My child, now, though we grieve for him, we must let this man lie[9] dead, in the way he first was killed through the gods’ designing.[10] Accept rather from me the glorious arms of Hephaistos,[11] so splendid, and such as no man has ever worn on his shoulders.”[12] The goddess spoke so, and set down the armour on the ground[13] before Achilleus, and all its elaboration clashed loudly.[14] Trembling took hold of all the Myrmidons. None had the courage[15] to look straight at it. They were afraid of it. Only Achilleus[16] looked, and as he looked the anger came harder upon him[17] and his eyes glittered terribly under his lids, like sunflare.[18] He was glad, holding in his hands the shining gifts of Hephaistos.[19] But when he had satisfied his heart with looking at the intricate[20] armour, he spoke to his mother and addressed her in winged words:[21] “My mother, the god has given me these weapons; they are such[22] as are the work of immortals. No mortal man could have made them.[23] Therefore now I shall arm myself in them. Yet I am sadly[24] afraid, during this time, for the warlike son of Menoitios[25] that flies might get into the wounds beaten by bronze in his body[26] and breed worms in them, and these make foul the body, seeing[27] that the life is killed in him, and that all his flesh may be rotted.”[28] In turn the goddess Thetis the silver-footed answered him:[29] “My child, no longer let these things be a care in your mind.[30] I shall endeavour to drive from him the swarming and fierce things,[31] those flies, which feed upon the bodies of men who have perished;[32] and although he lie here till a year has gone to fulfilment,[33] still his body shall be as it was, or firmer than ever.[34] Go then and summon into assembly the fighting Achaians,[35] and unsay your anger against Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[36] and arm at once for the fighting, and put your war strength upon you.”[37] She spoke so, and drove the strength of great courage into him;[38] and meanwhile through the nostrils of Patroklos she distilled[39] ambrosia and red nectar, so that his flesh might not spoil.[40] But he, brilliant Achilleus, walked along by the sea-shore[41] crying his terrible cry, and stirred up the fighting Achaians.  p 234  [42] And even those who before had stayed where the ships were assembled,[43] they who were helmsmen of the ships and handled the steering oar,[44] they who were stewards among the ships and dispensers of rations,[45] even these came then to assembly, since now Achilleus[46] had appeared, after staying so long from the sorrowful battle.[47] And there were two who came limping among them, henchmen of Ares[48] both, Tydeus’ son the staunch in battle, and brilliant Odysseus,[49] leaning on spears, since they had the pain of their wounds yet upon them,[50] and came and took their seats in the front rank of those assembled.[51] And last of them came in the lord of men Agamemnon[52] with a wound on him, seeing that Koön, the son of Antenor,[53] had stabbed him with the bronze edge of the spear in the strong encounter.[54] But now, when all the Achaians were in one body together,[55] Achilleus of the swift feet stood up before them and spoke to them:[56] “Son of Atreus, was this after all the better way for[57] both, for you and me, that we, for all our hearts’ sorrow,[58] quarrelled together for the sake of a girl in soul-perishing hatred?[59] I wish Artemis had killed her beside the ships with an arrow[60] on that day when I destroyed Lyrnessos and took her.[61] For thus not all these too many Achaians would have bitten[62] the dust, by enemy hands, when I was away in my anger.[63] This way was better for the Trojans and Hektor; yet I think[64] the Achaians will too long remember this quarrel between us.[65] Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, though it hurts us,[66] and beat down by constraint the anger that rises inside us.[67] Now I am making an end of my anger. It does not become me[68] unrelentingly to rage on. Come, then! The more quickly[69] drive on the flowing-haired Achaians into the fighting,[70] so that I may go up against the Trojans, and find out[71] if they still wish to sleep out beside the ships. I think rather[72] they will be glad to rest where they are, whoever among them[73] gets away with his life from the fury of our spears’ onset.”[74] He spoke, and the strong-greaved Achaians were pleasured to hear him[75] and how the great-hearted son of Peleus unsaid his anger.[76] Now among them spoke forth the lord of men Agamemnon[77] from the place where he was sitting, and did not stand up among them:[78] “Fighting men and friends, o Danaans, henchmen of Ares:[79] it is well to listen to the speaker, it is not becoming[80] to break in on him. This will be hard for him, though he be able.[81] How among the great murmur of people shall anyone listen[82] or speak either? A man, though he speak very clearly, is baffled.[83] I shall address the son of Peleus; yet all you other[84] Argives listen also, and give my word careful attention.[85] This is the word the Achaians have spoken often against me[86] and found fault with me in it, yet I am not responsible[87] but Zeus is, and Destiny, and Erinys the mist-walking[88] who in assembly caught my heart in the savage delusion[89] on that day I myself stripped from him the prize of Achilleus.[90] Yet what could I do? It is the god who accomplishes all things.[91] Delusion is the elder daughter of Zeus, the accursed[92] who deludes all; her feet are delicate and they step not[93] on the firm earth, but she walks the air above men’s heads  p 235  [94] and leads them astray. She has entangled others before me.[95] Yes, for once Zeus even was deluded, though men say[96] he is the highest one of gods and mortals. Yet Hera[97] who is female deluded even Zeus in her craftiness[98] on that day when in strong wall-circled Thebe Alkmene[99] was at her time to bring forth the strength of Herakles. Therefore[100] Zeus spoke forth and made a vow before all the immortals:[101] ‘Hear me, all you gods and all you goddesses: hear me[102] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[103] This day Eileithyia of women’s child-pains shall bring forth[104] a man to the light who, among the men sprung of the generation[105] of my blood, shall be lord over all those dwelling about him.’[106] Then in guileful intention the lady Hera said to him:[107] ‘You will be a liar, not put fulfilment on what you have spoken.[108] Come, then, lord of Olympos, and swear before me a strong oath[109] that he shall be lord over all those dwelling about him[110] who this day shall fall between the feet of a woman,[111] that man who is born of the blood of your generation.’ So Hera[112] spoke. And Zeus was entirely unaware of her falsehood,[113] but swore a great oath, and therein lay all his deception.[114] But Hera in a flash of speed left the horn of Olympos[115] and rapidly came to Argos of Achaia, where she knew[116] was the mighty wife of Sthenelos, descended of Perseus.[117] And she was carrying a son, and this was the seventh month for her,[118] but she brought him sooner into the light, and made him premature,[119] and stayed the childbirth of Alkmene, and held back the birth pangs.[120] She went herself and spoke the message to Zeus, son of Kronos:[121] ‘Father Zeus of the shining bolt, I will tell you a message[122] for your heart. A great man is born, who will be lord over the Argives,[123] Eurystheus, son of Sthenelos, of the seed of Perseus,[124] your generation. It is not unfit that he should rule over[125] the Argives.’ She spoke, and the sharp sorrow struck at his deep heart.[126] He caught by the shining hair of her head the goddess Delusion[127] in the anger of his heart, and swore a strong oath, that never[128] after this might Delusion, who deludes all, come back[129] to Olympos and the starry sky. So speaking, he whirled her[130] about in his hand and slung her out of the starry heaven,[131] and presently she came to men’s establishments. But Zeus[132] would forever grieve over her each time that he saw his dear son[133] doing some shameful work of the tasks that Eurystheus set him.[134] So I in my time, when tall Hektor of the shining helm[135] was forever destroying the Argives against the sterns of their vessels,[136] could not forget Delusion, the way I was first deluded.[137] But since I was deluded and Zeus took my wits away from me,[138] I am willing to make all good and give back gifts in abundance.[139] Rise up, then, to the fighting and rouse the rest of the people.[140] Here am I, to give you all those gifts, as many[141] as brilliant Odysseus yesterday went to your shelter and promised.[142] Or if you will, hold back, though you lean hard into the battle,[143] while my followers take the gifts from my ship and bring them[144] to you, so you may see what I give to comfort your spirit.”[145] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:  p 236  [146] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[147] the gifts are yours to give if you wish, and as it is proper,[148] or to keep with yourself. But now let us remember our joy in warcraft,[149] immediately, for it is not fitting to stay here and waste time[150] nor delay, since there is still a big work to be done.[151] So can a man see once more Achilleus among the front fighters[152] with the bronze spear wrecking the Trojan battalions. Therefore[153] let each of you remember this and fight his antagonist.”[154] Then in answer to him spoke resourceful Odysseus:[155] “Not that way, good fighter that you are, godlike Achilleus.[156] Do not drive the sons of the Achaians on Ilion when they are hungry,[157] to fight against the Trojans, since not short will be the time[158] of battle, once the massed formations of men have encountered[159] together, with the god inspiring fury in both sides.[160] Rather tell the men of Achaia here by their swift ships,[161] to take food and wine, since these make fighting fury and warcraft.[162] For a man will not have strength to fight his way forward all day[163] long until the sun goes down if he is starved for food. Even[164] though in his heart he be very passionate for the battle,[165] yet without his knowing it his limbs will go heavy, and hunger[166] and thirst will catch up with him and cumber his knees as he moves on.[167] But when a man has been well filled with wine and with eating[168] and then does battle all day long against the enemy,[169] why, then the heart inside him is full of cheer, nor do his limbs[170] get weary, until all are ready to give over the fighting.[171] Come then, tell your men to scatter and bid them get ready[172] a meal; and as for the gifts, let the lord of men Agamemnon[173] bring them to the middle of our assembly so all the Achaians[174] can see them before their eyes, so your own heart may be pleasured.[175] And let him stand up before the Argives and swear an oath to you[176] that he never entered into her bed and never lay with her[177] as is natural for people, my lord, between men and women.[178] And by this let the spirit in your own heart be made gracious.[179] After that in his own shelter let him appease you[180] with a generous meal, so you will lack nothing of what is due you.[181] And you, son of Atreus, after this be more righteous to another[182] man. For there is no fault when even one who is a king[183] appeases a man, when the king was the first one to be angry.”[184] Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:[185] “Hearing what you have said, son of Laertes, I am pleased with you.[186] Fairly have you gone through everything and explained it.[187] And all this I am willing to swear to, and my heart urges me,[188] and I will not be foresworn before the gods. Let Achilleus[189] stay here the while, though he lean very hard toward the work of the war god,[190] and remain the rest of you all here assembled, until the gifts come[191] back from my shelter and while we cut our oaths of fidelity.[192] And for you yourself, Odysseus, I give you this errand, this order,[193] that you choose out excellent young men of all the Achaians[194] and bring the gifts back here from my ship, all that you promised[195] yesterday to Achilleus, and bring the women back also.  p 237  [196] And in the wide host of the Achaians let Talthybios make ready[197] a boar for me, and dedicate it to Zeus and Helios.”[198] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[199] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[200] at some other time rather you should busy yourself about these things,[201] when there is some stopping point in the fighting, at some time[202] when there is not so much fury inside of my heart. But now[203] as things are they lie there torn whom the son of Priam[204] Hektor has beaten down, since Zeus was giving him glory,[205] and then you urge a man to eating. No, but I would now[206] drive forward the sons of the Achaians into the fighting[207] starving and unfed, and afterwards when the sun sets[208] make ready a great dinner, when we have paid off our defilement.[209] But before this, for me at least, neither drink nor food shall[210] go down my very throat, since my companion has perished[211] and lies inside my shelter torn about with the cutting[212] bronze, and turned against the forecourt while my companions[213] mourn about him. Food and drink mean nothing to my heart[214] but blood does, and slaughter, and the groaning of men in the hard work.”[215] Then in answer to him spoke resourceful Odysseus:[216] “Son of Peleus, Achilleus, far greatest of the Achaians,[217] you are stronger than I am and greater by not a little[218] with the spear, yet I in turn might overpass you in wisdom[219] by far, since I was born before you and have learned more things.[220] Therefore let your heart endure to listen to my words.[221] When there is battle men have suddenly their fill of it[222] when the bronze scatters on the ground the straw in most numbers[223] and the harvest is most thin, when Zeus has poised his balance,[224] Zeus, who is administrator to men in their fighting.[225] There is no way the Achaians can mourn a dead man by denying[226] the belly. Too many fall day by day, one upon another,[227] and how could anyone find breathing space from his labour?[228] No, but we must harden our hearts and bury the man who[229] dies, when we have wept over him on the day, and all those[230] who are left about from the hateful work of war must remember[231] food and drink, so that afterwards all the more strongly[232] we may fight on forever relentless against our enemies[233] with the weariless bronze put on about our bodies. Let one not[234] wait longing for any other summons to stir on the people.[235] This summons now shall be an evil on anyone left behind[236] by the ships of the Argives. Therefore let us drive on together[237] and wake the bitter war god on the Trojans, breaker of horses.”[238] He spoke, and went away with the sons of glorious Nestor,[239] with Meges, the son of Phyleus, and Meriones, and Thoas,[240] and Lykomedes, the son of Kreion, and Melanippos. These went[241] on their way to the shelter of Atreus’ son Agamemnon.[242] No sooner was the order given than the thing had been done.[243] They brought back seven tripods from the shelter, those Agamemnon[244] had promised, and twenty shining cauldrons, twelve horses. They brought back[245] immediately the seven women the work of whose hands was  p 238  [246] blameless, and the eighth of them was Briseis of the fair cheeks.[247] Odysseus weighed out ten full talents of gold and led them[248] back, and the young men of the Achaians carried the other gifts.[249] They brought these into the midst of assembly, and Agamemnon[250] stood up, and Talthybios in voice like an immortal[251] stood beside the shepherd of the people with the boar in his hands.[252] Atreus’ son laid hands upon his work-knife, and drew it[253] from where it hung ever beside the great sheath of his war sword,[254] and cut first hairs away from the boar, and lifting his hands up[255] to Zeus, prayed, while all the Argives stayed fast at their places[256] in silence and in order of station, and listened to their king.[257] He spoke before them in prayer going into the wide sky:[258] “Let Zeus first be my witness, highest of the gods and greatest,[259] and Earth, and Helios the Sun, and Furies, who underground[260] avenge dead men, when any man has sworn to a falsehood,[261] that I have never laid a hand on the girl Briseis[262] on pretext to go to bed with her, or for any other[263] reason, but she remained, not singled out, in my shelter.[264] If any of this is falsely sworn, may the gods give me many[265] griefs, all that they inflict on those who swear falsely before them.”[266] So he spoke, and with pitiless bronze he cut the boar’s throat.[267] Talthybios whirled the body about, and threw it in the great reach[268] of the grey sea, to feed the fishes. Meanwhile Achilleus[269] stood up among the battle-fond Achaians, and spoke to them:[270] “Father Zeus, great are the delusions with which you visit men.[271] Without you, the son of Atreus could never have stirred so[272] the heart inside my breast, nor taken the girl away from me[273] against my will, and be in helplessness. No, but Zeus somehow[274] wished that death should befall great numbers of the Achaians.[275] Go now and take your dinner, so we may draw on the battle.”[276] So he spoke, and suddenly broke up the assembly.[277] Now these scattered away each man to his own ship. Meanwhile[278] the great-hearted Myrmidons disposed of the presents.[279] They went on their way carrying them to the ship of godlike Achilleus,[280] and stowed the gifts in the shelters, and let the women be settled,[281] while proud henchmen drove the horses into Achilleus’ horse-herd.[282] And now, in the likeness of golden Aphrodite, Briseis[283] when she saw Patroklos lying torn with sharp bronze, folding[284] him in her arms cried shrilly above him and with her hands tore[285] at her breasts and her soft throat and her beautiful forehead.[286] The woman like the immortals mourning for him spoke to him:[287] “Patroklos, far most pleasing to my heart in its sorrows,[288] I left you here alive when I went away from the shelter,[289] but now I come back, lord of the people, to find you have fallen.[290] So evil in my life takes over from evil forever.[291] The husband on whom my father and honoured mother bestowed me[292] I saw before my city lying torn with the sharp bronze,[293] and my three brothers, whom a single mother bore with me[294] and who were close to me, all went on one day to destruction.[295] And yet you would not let me, when swift Achilleus had cut down[296] my husband, and sacked the city of godlike Mynes, you would not[297] let me sorrow, but said you would make me godlike Achilleus’  p 239  [298] wedded lawful wife, that you would take me back in the ships[299] to Phthia, and formalize my marriage among the Myrmidons.[300] Therefore I weep your death without ceasing. You were kind always.”[301] So she spoke, lamenting, and the women sorrowed around her[302] grieving openly for Patroklos, but for her own sorrows[303] each. But the lords of Achaia were gathered about Achilleus[304] beseeching him to eat, but he with a groan denied them:[305] “I beg of you, if any dear companion will listen[306] to me, stop urging me to satisfy the heart in me[307] with food and drink, since this strong sorrow has come upon me.[308] I will hold out till the sun goes down and endure, though it be hard.”[309] So he spoke, and caused the rest of the kings to scatter;[310] but the two sons of Atreus stayed with him, and brilliant Odysseus,[311] and Nestor, and Idomeneus, and the aged charioteer, Phoinix,[312] comforting him close in his sorrow, yet his heart would not[313] be comforted, till he went into the jaws of the bleeding battle.[314] Remembering Patroklos he sighed much for him, and spoke aloud:[315] “There was a time, ill fated, o dearest of all my companions,[316] when you yourself would set the desirable dinner before me[317] quickly and expertly, at the time the Achaians were urgent[318] to carry sorrowful war on the Trojans, breakers of horses.[319] But now you lie here torn before me, and my heart goes starved[320] for meat and drink, though they are here beside me, by reason[321] of longing for you. There is nothing worse than this I could suffer,[322] not even if I were to hear of the death of my father[323] who now, I think, in Phthia somewhere lets fall a soft tear[324] for bereavement of such a son, for me, who now in a strange land[325] make war upon the Trojans for the sake of accursed Helen;[326] or the death of my dear son, who is raised for my sake in Skyros[327] now, if godlike Neoptolemos is still one of the living.[328] Before now the spirit inside my breast was hopeful[329] that I alone should die far away from horse-pasturing Argos[330] here in Troy; I hoped you would win back again to Phthia[331] so that in a fast black ship you could take my son back[332] from Skyros to Phthia, and show him all my possessions,[333] my property, my serving men, my great high-roofed house.[334] For by this time I think that Peleus must altogether[335] have perished, or still keeps a little scant life in sorrow[336] for the hatefulness of old age and because he waits ever from me[337] the evil message, for the day he hears I have been killed.”[338] So he spoke, mourning, and the elders lamented around him[339] remembering each those he had left behind in his own halls.[340] The son of Kronos took pity on them as he watched them mourning[341] and immediately spoke in winged words to Athene:[342] “My child, have you utterly abandoned the man of your choice?[343] Is there no longer deep concern in your heart for Achilleus?[344] Now he has sat down before the steep horned ships and is mourning[345] for his own beloved companion, while all the others[346] have gone to take their dinner, but he is fasting and unfed.[347] Go then to him and distil nectar inside his chest, and delicate[348] ambrosia, so the weakness of hunger will not come upon him.”[349] Speaking so, he stirred Athene, who was eager before this,  p 240  [350] and she in the likeness of a wide-winged, thin-crying[351] hawk plummeted from the sky through the bright air. Now the Achaians[352] were arming at once along the encampment. She dropped the delicate[353] ambrosia and the nectar inside the breast of Achilleus[354] softly, so no sad weakness of hunger would come on his knees,[355] and she herself went back to the close house of her powerful[356] father, while they were scattering out away from the fast ships.[357] As when in their thickness the snowflakes of Zeus come fluttering[358] cold beneath the blast of the north wind born in the bright sky,[359] so now in their thickness the pride of the helms bright shining[360] were carried out from the ships, and shields massive in the middle[361] and the corselets strongly hollowed and the ash spears were worn forth.[362] The shining swept to the sky and all earth was laughing about them[363] under the glitter of bronze and beneath their feet stirred the thunder[364] of men, within whose midst brilliant Achilleus helmed him.[365] A clash went from the grinding of his teeth, and his eyes glowed[366] as if they were the stare of a fire, and the heart inside him[367] was entered with sorrow beyond endurance. Raging at the Trojans[368] he put on the gifts of the god, that Hephaistos wrought him with much toil.[369] First he placed along his legs the fair greaves linked with[370] silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.[371] Afterward he girt on about his chest the corselet,[372] and across his shoulders slung the sword with the nails of silver,[373] a bronze sword, and caught up the great shield, huge and heavy[374] next, and from it the light glimmered far, as from the moon.[375] And as when from across water a light shines to mariners[376] from a blazing fire, when the fire is burning high in the mountains[377] in a desolate steading, as the mariners are carried unwilling[378] by storm winds over the fish-swarming sea, far away from their loved ones;[379] so the light from the fair elaborate shields of Achilleus[380] shot into the high air. And lifting the helm he set it[381] massive upon his head, and the helmet crested with horse-hair[382] shone like a star, the golden fringes were shaken about it[383] which Hephaistos had driven close along the horn of the helmet.[384] And brilliant Achilleus tried himself in his armour, to see[385] if it fitted close, and how his glorious limbs ran within it,[386] and the armour became as wings and upheld the shepherd of the people.[387] Next he pulled out from its standing place the spear of his father,[388] huge, heavy, thick, which no one else of all the Achaians[389] could handle, but Achilleus alone knew how to wield it,[390] the Pelian ash spear which Cheiron had brought to his father[391] from high on Pelion, to be death for fighters in battle.[392] Automedon and Alkimos, in charge of the horses,[393] yoked them, and put the fair breast straps about them, and forced the bits home[394] between their jaws, and pulled the reins back against the compacted[395] chariot seat, and one, Automedon, took up the shining[396] whip caught close in his hand and vaulted up to the chariot,[397] while behind him Achilleus helmed for battle took his stance[398] shining in all his armour like the sun when he crosses above us,[399] and cried in a terrible voice on the horses of his father:[400] “Xanthos, Balios, Bay and Dapple, famed sons of Podarge,  p 241  [401] take care to bring in another way your charioteer back[402] to the company of the Danaans, when we give over fighting,[403] not leave him to lie fallen there, as you did to Patroklos.”[404] Then from beneath the yoke the gleam-footed horse answered him,[405] Xanthos, and as he spoke bowed his head, so that all the mane[406] fell away from the pad and swept the ground by the cross-yoke;[407] the goddess of the white arms, Hera, had put a voice in him:[408] “We shall still keep you safe for this time, o hard Achilleus.[409] And yet the day of your death is near, but it is not we[410] who are to blame, but a great god and powerful Destiny.[411] For it was not because we were slow, because we were careless,[412] that the Trojans have taken the armour from the shoulders of Patroklos,[413] but it was that high god, the child of lovely-haired Leto,[414] who killed him among the champions and gave the glory to Hektor.[415] But for us, we two could run with the blast of the west wind[416] who they say is the lightest of all things; yet still for you[417] there is destiny to be killed in force by a god and a mortal.”[418] When he had spoken so the Furies stopped the voice in him,[419] but deeply disturbed, Achilleus of the swift feet answered him:[420] “Xanthos, why do you prophesy my death? This is not for you.[421] I myself know well it is destined for me to die here[422] far from my beloved father and mother. But for all that[423] I will not stop till the Trojans have had enough of my fighting.”[424] He spoke, and shouting held on in the foremost his single-foot horses.book twenty[1] So these now, the Achaians, beside the curved ships were arming[2] around you, son of Peleus, insatiate of battle,[3] while on the other side at the break of the plain the Trojans[4] armed. But Zeus, from the many-folded peak of Olympos,[5] told Themis to summon all the gods into assembly. She went[6] everywhere, and told them to make their way to Zeus’ house.[7] There was no river who was not there, except only Ocean,[8] there was not any one of the nymphs who live in the lovely[9] groves, and the springs of rivers and grass of the meadows, who came not.[10] These all assembling into the house of Zeus cloud gathering[11] took places among the smooth-stone cloister walks which Hephaistos[12] had built for Zeus the father by his craftsmanship and contrivance.[13] So they were assembled within Zeus’ house; and the shaker[14] of the earth did not fail to hear the goddess, but came up among them[15] from the sea, and sat in the midst of them, and asked Zeus of his counsel:[16] “Why, lord of the shining bolt, have you called the gods to assembly[17] once more? Are you deliberating Achaians and Trojans?[18] For the onset of battle is almost broken to flame between them.”[19] In turn Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him in answer:[20] “You have seen, shaker of the earth, the counsel within me,[21] and why I gathered you. I think of these men though they are dying.[22] Even so, I shall stay here upon the fold of Olympos[23] sitting still, watching, to pleasure my heart. Meanwhile all you others  p 242  [24] go down, wherever you may go among the Achaians and Trojans[25] and give help to either side, as your own pleasure directs you.[26] For if we leave Achilleus alone to fight with the Trojans[27] they will not even for a little hold off swift-footed Peleion.[28] For even before now they would tremble whenever they saw him,[29] and now, when his heart is grieved and angered for his companion’s[30] death, I fear against destiny he may storm their fortress.”[31] So spoke the son of Kronos and woke the incessant battle,[32] and the gods went down to enter the fighting, with purposes opposed.[33] Hera went to the assembled ships with Pallas Athene[34] and with Poseidon who embraces the earth, and with generous[35] Hermes, who within the heart is armed with astute thoughts.[36] Hephaistos went the way of these in the pride of his great strength[37] limping, and yet his shrunken legs moved lightly beneath him.[38] But Ares of the shining helm went over to the Trojans,[39] and with him Phoibos of the unshorn hair, and the lady of arrows[40] Artemis, and smiling Aphrodite, Leto, and Xanthos.[41] Now in the time when the gods were still distant from the mortals,[42] so long the Achaians were winning great glory, since now Achilleus[43] showed among them, who had stayed too long from the sorrowful fighting.[44] But the Trojans were taken every man in the knees with trembling[45] and terror, as they looked on the swift-footed son of Peleus[46] shining in all his armour, a man like the murderous war god.[47] But after the Olympians merged in the men’s company[48] strong Hatred, defender of people, burst out, and Athene bellowed[49] standing now beside the ditch dug at the wall’s outside[50] and now again at the thundering sea’s edge gave out her great cry,[51] while on the other side Ares in the likeness of a dark stormcloud[52] bellowed, now from the peak of the citadel urging the Trojans[53] sharply on, now running beside the sweet banks of Simoeis.[54] So the blessed gods stirring on the opponents drove them[55] together, and broke out among themselves the weight of their quarrel.[56] From high above the father of gods and men made thunder[57] terribly, while Poseidon from deep under them shuddered[58] all the illimitable earth, the sheer heads of the mountains.[59] And all the feet of Ida with her many waters were shaken[60] and all her crests, and the city of Troy, the ships of the Achaians.[61] Aïdoneus, lord of the dead below, was in terror[62] and sprang from his throne and screamed aloud, for fear that above him[63] he who circles the land, Poseidon, might break the earth open[64] and the houses of the dead lie open to men and immortals,[65] ghastly and mouldering, so the very gods shudder before them;[66] such was the crash that sounded as the gods came driving together[67] in wrath. For now over against the lord Poseidon[68] Phoibos Apollo took his stand with his feathered arrows,[69] and against Enyalios the goddess grey-eyed Athene.[70] Against Hera stood the lady of clamour, of the golden distaff,[71] of the showering arrows, Artemis, sister of the far striker.[72] Opposite Leto stood the strong one, generous Hermes,[73] and against Hephaistos stood the great deep-eddying river[74] who is called Xanthos by the gods, but by mortals Skamandros.[75] Thus gods went on to encounter gods; and meanwhile Achilleus  p 243  [76] was straining to plunge into the combat opposite Hektor[77] Priam’s son, since beyond all others his anger was driving him[78] to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield’s guard.[79] But it was Aineias whom Apollo defender of people[80] drove straight against Peleion, and inspired vast power within him.[81] Zeus’ son Apollo made his voice like that of Lykaon[82] Priam’s son, and assumed his appearance, and spoke to Aineias:[83] “Aineias, lord of the Trojans’ counsels. Where are those threats gone[84] which as you drank your wine you made before Troy’s kings, solemnly,[85] that you would match you battle strength with Peleian Achilleus?”[86] In turn Aineias spoke to him in answer: “Lykaon[87] son of Priam, why do you urge me on against my will[88] to fight in the face of Peleus’ son and his too great fury?[89] Since this will not be the first time I stand up against swift-footed[90] Achilleus, but another time before now he drove me[91] with the spear from Ida, when he came there after our cattle[92] the time he sacked Lyrnessos and Pedasos. But Zeus rescued me[93] when he put strength inside me and made my knees quick. Otherwise[94] I should have gone down at Achilleus’ hands, and those of Athene[95] who goes before him and makes light before him, who then was urging[96] him on with the brazen spear to destroy Leleges and Trojans.[97] Thereby it is not for any man to fight with Achilleus.[98] There is always some one of the gods with him to beat death from him.[99] Without this, even, his spear wings straight to its mark, nor gives out[100] until it has gone through a man’s body. But if the god only[101] would pull out even the issue of war, he would not so easily[102] win, not even though he claims to be made all of bronze.”[103] In turn the lord the son of Zeus Apollo spoke to him:[104] “Hero, then make your prayer, you also, to the everlasting[105] gods, since they say that you yourself are born of Zeus’ daughter[106] Aphrodite, but Achilleus was born of a lesser goddess,[107] Aphrodite being daughter of Zeus, Thetis of the sea’s ancient.[108] Carry your weariless bronze straight against him, let him by no means[109] turn you back by blustering words and his threats of terror.”[110] So speaking, he inspired enormous strength in the shepherd of the people,[111] who strode on his way among the champions helmed in the bright bronze,[112] nor did Hera of the white arms fail to see the son of Anchises[113] as he went through the thronging men to face the son of Peleus,[114] and drew the other immortals about her and spoke to them, saying:[115] “Poseidon and Athene, now take counsel between you[116] and within your hearts as to how these matters shall be accomplished.[117] Here is Aineias gone helmed in the shining bronze against[118] Peleus’ son, and it was Phoibos Apollo who sent him.[119] Come then, we must even go down ourselves and turn him[120] back from here, or else one of us must stand by Achilleus[121] and put enormous strength upon him, and let him not come short[122] in courage, but let him know that they love him who are the highest[123] of the immortals, but those who before now fended the fury[124] of war, as now, from the Trojans are as wind and nothing.[125] For all of us have come down from Olympos to take our part[126] in this battle, so nothing may be done to him by the Trojans[127] on this day. Afterwards he shall suffer such things as Destiny  p 244  [128] wove with the strand of his birth that day he was born to his mother.[129] But if Achilleus does not hear all this from gods’ voices[130] he will be afraid, when a god puts out his strength against him[131] in the fighting. It is hard for gods to be shown in their true shape.”[132] In turn Poseidon the shaker of the earth answered her:[133] “Hera, do not be angry without purpose. It does not[134] become you, since I at least would not have the rest of us gods[135] encounter in battle, since indeed we are far too strong for them.[136] Let us then go away and sit down together off the path[137] at a viewing place, and let the men take care of their fighting.[138] Only if Ares begins to fight, or Phoibos Apollo,[139] or if they hold Achilleus back and will not let him fight,[140] then at once they will have a quarrel with us on their hands[141] in open battle. But soon, I think, when they have fought with us[142] they will get back to Olympos and the throng of the other gods[143] beaten back by the overmastering strength of our hands.”[144] So he spoke, Poseidon of the dark hair, and led the way[145] to the stronghold of godlike Herakles, earth-piled on both sides,[146] a high place, which the Trojans and Pallas Athene had built him[147] as a place of escape where he could get away from the Sea Beast[148] when the charging monster drove him away to the plain from the sea shore.[149] There Poseidon and the gods who were with him sat down[150] and gathered a breakless wall of cloud to darken their shoulders;[151] while they of the other side sat down on the brows of the sweet bluffs[152] around you, lord Apollo, and Ares sacker of cities.[153] So they on either side took their places, deliberating[154] counsels, reluctant on both sides to open the sorrowful[155] attack. But Zeus sitting on high above urged them on.[156] But all the plain was filled and shining with bronze of the mortals,[157] their men and horses, and underneath their feet the earth staggered[158] as they swept together. Two men far greater than all the others[159] were coming to encounter, furious to fight with each other,[160] Aineias, the son of Anchises, and brilliant Achilleus.[161] First of the two Aineias had strode forth in menace, tossing[162] his head beneath the heavy helm, and he held the stark shield[163] in front of his chest, and shook the brazen spear. From the other[164] side the son of Peleus rose like a lion against him,[165] the baleful beast, when men have been straining to kill him, the county[166] all in the hunt, and he at the first pays them no attention[167] but goes his way, only when some one of the impetuous young men[168] has hit him with the spear he whirls, jaws open, over his teeth foam[169] breaks out, and in the depth of his chest the powerful heart groans;[170] he lashes his own ribs with his tail and the flanks on both sides[171] as he rouses himself to fury for the fight, eyes glaring,[172] and hurls himself straight onward on the chance of killing some one[173] of the men, or else being killed himself in the first onrush.[174] So the proud heart and fighting fury stirred on Achilleus[175] to go forward in the face of great-hearted Aineias.[176] Now as these in their advance had come close to each other[177] first of the two to speak was swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:[178] “Aineias, why have you stood so far forth from the multitude[179] against me? Does the desire in your heart drive you to combat  p 245  [180] in hope you will be lord of the Trojans, breakers of horses,[181] and of Priam’s honour. And yet even if you were to kill me[182] Priam would not because of that rest such honour on your hand.[183] He has sons, and he himself is sound, not weakened.[184] Or have the men of Troy promised you a piece of land, surpassing[185] all others, fine ploughland and orchard for you to administer[186] if you kill me? But I think that killing will not be easy.[187] Another time before this, I tell you, you ran from my spear.[188] Or do you not remember when, apart from your cattle, I caught you[189] alone, and chased you in the speed of your feet down the hills of Ida[190] headlong, and that time as you ran you did not turn to look back.[191] Then you got away into Lyrnessos, but I went after you[192] and stormed that place, with the help of Athene and of Zeus father,[193] and took the day of liberty away from their women[194] and led them as spoil, but Zeus and the other gods saved you.[195] I think they will not save you now, as your expectation[196] tells you they will. No, but I myself urge you to get back[197] into the multitude, not stand to face me, before you[198] take some harm. Once a thing has been done, the fool sees it.”[199] Then in turn Aineias spoke to him and made his answer:[200] “Son of Peleus, never hope by words to frighten me[201] as if I were a baby. I myself understand well enough[202] how to speak in vituperation and how to make insults.[203] You and I know each other’s birth, we both know our parents[204] since we have heard the lines of their fame from mortal men; only[205] I have never with my eyes seen your parents, nor have you seen mine.[206] For you, they say you are the issue of blameless Peleus[207] and that your mother was Thetis of the lovely hair, the sea’s lady;[208] I in turn claim I am the son of great-hearted Anchises[209] but that my mother was Aphrodite; and that of these parents[210] one group or the other will have a dear son to mourn for[211] this day. Since I believe we will not in mere words, like children,[212] meet, and separate and go home again out of the fighting.[213] Even so, if you wish to learn all this and be certain[214] of my genealogy: there are plenty of men who know it.[215] First of all Zeus who gathers the clouds had a son, Dardanos[216] who founded Dardania, since there was yet no sacred Ilion[217] made a city in the plain to be a centre of peoples,[218] but they lived yet in the underhills of Ida with all her waters.[219] Dardanos in turn had a son, the king, Erichthonios,[220] who became the richest of mortal men, and in his possession[221] were three thousand horses who pastured along the low grasslands,[222] mares in their pride with their young colts; and with these the North Wind[223] fell in love as they pastured there, and took on upon him[224] the likeness of a dark-maned stallion, and coupled with them,[225] and the mares conceiving of him bore to him twelve young horses.[226] Those, when they would play along the grain-giving tilled land[227] would pass along the tassels of corn and not break the divine yield,[228] but again, when they played across the sea’s wide ridges[229] they would run the edge of the wave where it breaks on the grey salt water.[230] Erichthonios had a son, Tros, who was lord of the Trojans,[231] and to Tros in turn there were born three sons unfaulted,  p 246  [232] Ilos and Assarakos and godlike Ganymedes[233] who was the loveliest born of the race of mortals, and therefore[234] the gods caught him away themselves, to be Zeus’ wine-pourer,[235] for the sake of his beauty, so he might be among the immortals.[236] Ilos in turn was given a son, the blameless Laomedon,[237] and Laomedon had sons in turn, Tithonos and Priam,[238] Lampos, Klytios and Hiketaon, scion of Ares;[239] but Assarakos had Kapys, and Kapys’ son was Anchises,[240] and I am Anchises’ son, and Priam’s is Hektor the brilliant.[241] Such is the generation and blood I claim to be born from.[242] Zeus builds up and Zeus diminishes the strength in men,[243] the way he pleases, since his power is beyond all others’.[244] But come, let us no longer stand here talking of these things[245] like children, here in the space between the advancing armies.[246] For there are harsh things enough that could be spoken against us[247] both, a ship of a hundred locks could not carry the burden.[248] The tongue of man is a twisty thing, there are plenty of words there[249] of every kind, the range of words is wide, and their variance.[250] The sort of thing you say is the thing that will be said to you.[251] But what have you and I to do with the need for squabbling[252] and hurling insults at each other, as if we were two wives[253] who when they have fallen upon a heart-perishing quarrel[254] go out in the street and say abusive things to each other,[255] much true, and much that is not, and it is their rage that drives them.[256] You will not by talking turn me back from the strain of my warcraft,[257] not till you have fought to my face with the bronze. Come on then[258] and let us try each other’s strength with the bronze of our spearheads.”[259] He spoke, and on the terrible grim shield drove the ponderous[260] pike, so that the great shield moaned as it took the spearhead.[261] The son of Peleus with his heavy hand held the shield away[262] from him, in fright, since he thought the far-shadowing spear[263] of great-hearted Aineias would lightly be driven through it.[264] Fool, and the heart and spirit in him could not understand[265] how the glorious gifts of the gods are not easily broken[266] by mortal men, how such gifts will not give away before them.[267] Nor this time could the ponderous spear of war-wise Aineias[268] smash the shield, since the gold stayed it, the god’s gift. Indeed[269] he did drive the spear through two folds, but there were three left[270] still, since the god of the dragging feet had made five folds on it,[271] two of bronze on the outside and on the inside two of tin[272] and between them the single gold, and in this the ash spear was held fast.[273] After him Achilleus let go his spear far-shadowing[274] and struck the shield of Aineias along its perfect circle[275] at the utter rim where the circle of bronze ran thinnest about it[276] and the oxhide was laid thinnest there. The Pelian ash spear[277] crashed clean through it there, and the shield cried out as it went through.[278] Aineias shrank down and held the shield away and above him[279] in fright, and the spear went over his back and crashed its way[280] to the ground, and fixed there, after tearing apart two circles[281] of the man-covering shield. But Aineias, free of the long spear,[282] stood still, and around his eyes gathered the enormous emotion[283] and fear, that the weapon had fixed so close to him. Now Achilleus  p 247  [284] drew his tearing sword and swept in fury upon him[285] crying a terrible cry, but Aineias now in his hand caught[286] up a stone, a huge thing which no two men could carry[287] such as men are now, but by himself he lightly hefted it.[288] And there Aineias would have hit him with the stone as he swept in,[289] on helm or shield, which would have fended the bitter death from him,[290] and Peleus’ son would have closed with the sword and stripped the life from him,[291] had not the shaker of the earth Poseidon sharply perceived all[292] and immediately spoken his word out among the immortals:[293] “Ah me; I am full of sorrow for great-hearted Aineias[294] who must presently go down to death, overpowered by Achilleus,[295] because he believed the words of Apollo, the far ranging;[296] poor fool, since Apollo will do nothing to keep grim death from him.[297] But why does this man, who is guiltless, suffer his sorrows[298] for no reason, for the sake of others’ unhappiness, and always[299] he gives gifts that please them to the gods who hold the wide heaven.[300] But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear[301] the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus[302] kills this man. It is destined that he shall be the survivor,[303] that the generation of Dardanos shall not die, without seed[304] obliterated, since Dardanos was dearest to Kronides[305] of all his sons that have been born to him from mortal women.[306] For Kronos’ son has cursed the generation of Priam,[307] and now the might of Aineias shall be lord over the Trojans,[308] and his sons’ sons, and those who are born of their seed hereafter.”[309] In turn the lady of the ox eyes, Hera, answered him:[310] “Shaker of the earth, you yourself must decide in your own heart[311] about Aineias, whether to rescue him or to let him[312] go down, for all his strength, before Peleus’ son, Achilleus.[313] For we two, Pallas Athene and I, have taken[314] numerous oaths and sworn them in the sight of all the immortals[315] never to drive the day of evil away from the Trojans,[316] not even when all the city of Troy is burned in the ravening[317] fire, on that day when the warlike sons of the Achaians burn it.”[318] When he had heard this, the shaker of the earth Poseidon[319] went on his way through the confusion of spears and the fighting,[320] and came to where Aineias was, and renowned Achilleus.[321] There quickly he drifted a mist across the eyes of one fighter,[322] Achilleus, Peleus’ son, and from the shield of Aineias[323] of the great heart pulled loose the strong bronze-headed ash spear[324] and laid it down again before the feet of Achilleus;[325] but Aineias he lifted high from the ground, and slung him through the air[326] so that many ranks of fighting men, many ranks of horses,[327] were overvaulted by Aineias, hurled by the god’s hand.[328] He landed at the uttermost edge of the tossing battle[329] where the Kaukonians were arming them for the order of fighting.[330] And Poseidon, shaker of the earth, came and stood very near him[331] and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: “Aineias,[332] which one of the gods is it who urges you to such madness[333] that you fight in the face of Peleus’ son, against his high courage[334] though he is both stronger than you and dearer to the immortals?  p 248  [335] Give back rather, whenever you find yourself thrown against him,[336] lest beyond your fate you go down into the house of the death god.[337] But once Achilleus has fulfilled his death and his destiny,[338] then take courage, and go on, and fight with their foremost,[339] since there shall be no other Achaian able to kill you.”[340] He spoke, and left him there, when he had told him all this,[341] and at once scattered the mist away from the eyes of Achilleus[342] that the gods had sent, and now he looked with his eyes, and saw largely,[343] and in disgust spoke then to his own great-hearted spirit:[344] “Can this be? Here is a strange thing I see with my own eyes.[345] Here is my spear lying on the ground, but I can no longer[346] see the man, whom I was charging in fury to kill him.[347] Aineias was then one beloved of the immortal[348] gods. I thought what he said was ineffectual boasting.[349] Let him go. He will not again have daring to try me[350] in battle, since even now he was glad to escape my onset.[351] Come! I must urge on the Danaans whose delight is in battle[352] and go on to face the rest of the Trojans, and see what they can do.”[353] He spoke, and leapt back into the ranks, and urged each man on:[354] “No longer stand away from the Trojans, o great Achaians,[355] but let each go to face his man, furious to fight him.[356] It is a hard thing for me, for all my great strength, to harry[357] the flight of men in such numbers or to fight with all of them.[358] Not Ares, who is a god immortal, not even Athene[359] could take the edge of such masses of men and fight a way through them.[360] But what I can do with hands and feet and strength I tell you[361] I will do, and I shall not hang back even a little[362] but go straight on through their formation, and I think that no man[363] of the Trojans will be glad when he comes within my spear’s range.”[364] He spoke, urging them on, but glorious Hektor called out[365] in a great voice to the Trojans, and was minded to face Achilleus:[366] “Do not be afraid of Peleion, o high-hearted Trojans.[367] I myself could fight in words against the immortals,[368] but with the spear it were hard, since they are far stronger than we are.[369] Even Achilleus will not win achievement of everything[370] he says. Part he will accomplish, but part shall be baulked halfway done.[371] I am going to stand against him now, though his hands are like flame,[372] and his heart like the shining of iron.”[373] He spoke, urging the Trojans, and they lifted their spears to face them.[374] Their fury gathered into bulk and their battle cry rose up.[375] But now Phoibos Apollo stood by Hektor and spoke to him:[376] “Hektor, do not go out all alone to fight with Achilleus,[377] but wait for him in the multitude and out of the carnage[378] lest he hit you with the spear or the stroke of the sword from close in.”[379] He spoke, and Hektor plunged back into the swarm of the fighting[380] men, in fear, when he heard the voice of the god speaking.[381] But Achilleus, gathering the fury upon him, sprang on the Trojans[382] with a ghastly cry, and the first of them he killed was Iphition[383] the great son of Otrynteus and a lord over numbers of people,[384] born of a naiad nymph to Otrynteus, sacker of cities,[385] under the snows of Tmolos in the rich countryside of Hydē.  p 249  [386] Great Achilleus struck him with the spear as he came in fury,[387] in the middle of the head, and all the head broke into two pieces.[388] He fell, thunderously. Great Achilleus vaunted above him:[389] “Lie there, Otrynteus’ son, most terrifying of all men.[390] Here is your death, but your generation was by the lake waters[391] of Gyge, where is the allotted land of your fathers[392] by fish-swarming Hyllos and the whirling waters of Hermos.”[393] He spoke, vaunting, but darkness shrouded the eyes of the other,[394] and the running-rims of Achaian chariots cut him to pieces[395] in the van of the onrush. Next, after him, facing Demoleon[396] lord defender of battle and son of Antenor, Achilleus[397] stabbed him in the temple through the brazen sides of the helmet,[398] and the brazen helmet could not hold, but the bronze spearhead[399] driven on through smashed the bone apart, and the inward[400] brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury.[401] Next he stabbed with a spear-stroke in the back Hippodamas[402] as he fled away before him and sprang from behind his horses.[403] He blew his life away, bellowing, as when a bull[404] bellows as he is dragged for Poseidon, lord of Helike,[405] and the young men drag him. In such bulls the earth shaker glories.[406] Such was his bellowing as the proud spirit flitted from his bones.[407] Next he went with the spear after godlike Polydoros,[408] Priam’s son, whom his father would not let go into battle[409] because he was youngest born of all his sons to him, and also[410] the most beloved, and in speed of his feet outpassed all the others.[411] But now, in his young thoughtlessness and display of his running[412] he swept among the champions until thus he destroyed his dear life.[413] For as he shot by swift-footed brilliant Achilleus hit him[414] with a spear thrown in the middle of the back where the clasps of the war belt[415] were golden and came together at the joining halves of the corselet.[416] The spearhead held its way straight on and came out by the navel,[417] and he dropped, moaning, on one knee as the dark mist gathered[418] about him, and sagged, and caught with his hands at his bowels in front of him.[419] But now when Hektor saw Polydoros, his own brother,[420] going limp to the ground and catching his bowels in his hands,[421] the mist closed about his eyes also, he could stand no longer[422] to turn there at a distance, but went out to face Achilleus[423] hefting his sharp spear, like a flame. Seeing him Achilleus[424] balanced his spear in turn, and called out to him, and challenged him:[425] “Here is the man who beyond all others has troubled my anger,[426] who slaughtered my beloved companion. Let us no longer[427] shrink away from each other along the edgeworks of battle.”[428] He spoke, and looking darkly at brilliant Hektor spoke to him:[429] “Come nearer, so that sooner you may reach your appointed destruction.”[430] But with no fear Hektor of the shining helm answered him:[431] “Son of Peleus, never hope by words to frighten me[432] as if I were a baby. I myself understand well enough[433] how to speak in vituperation and how to make insults.[434] I know that you are great and that I am far weaker than you are.  p 250  [435] Still, all this lies upon the knees of the gods; and it may be[436] that weaker as I am I might still strip the life from you[437] with a cast of the spear, since my weapon too has been sharp before this.”[438] He spoke, and balanced the spear and let it fly. But Athene[439] blew against it and turned it back from renowned Achilleus[440] with an easy blast. It came back again to glorious Hektor[441] and dropped to the ground in front of his feet. Meanwhile Achilleus[442] made a furious charge against him, raging to kill him[443] with a terrible cry, but Phoibos Apollo caught up Hektor[444] easily, since he was a god, and wrapped him in thick mist.[445] Three times swift-footed brilliant Achilleus swept in against him[446] with the brazen spear. Three times his stroke went into the deep mist.[447] But as a fourth time, like something more than a man, he charged in,[448] Achilleus with a terrible cry called in winged words after him:[449] “Once again now you escaped death, dog. And yet the evil[450] came near you, but now once more Phoibos Apollo has saved you,[451] he to whom you must pray when you go into the thunder of spears thrown.[452] Yet I may win you, if I encounter you ever hereafter,[453] if beside me also there is some god who will help me.[454] Now I must chase whoever I can overtake of the others.”[455] He spoke, and with the spear full in the neck stabbed Dryops[456] so that he dropped in front of his feet. He left him to lie there[457] and with a spear thrown against the knee stopped the charge of Demouchos,[458] Philetor’s son, a huge man and powerful. After the spearcast[459] with an inward plunge of the great sword he took the life from him.[460] Then Achilleus swooping on Dardanos and Laogonos, sons both[461] of Bias, dashed them to the ground from behind their horses,[462] one with a spearcast, one with a stroke of the sword from close up.[463] Now Tros, Alastor’s son: he had come up against Achilleus’[464] knees, to catch them and be spared and his life given to him[465] if Achilleus might take pity upon his youth and not kill him;[466] fool, and did not see there would be no way to persuade him,[467] since this was a man with no sweetness in his heart, and not kindly[468] but in a strong fury; now Tros with his hands was reaching[469] for the knees, bent on supplication, but he stabbed with his sword at the liver[470] so that the liver was torn from its place, and from it the black blood[471] drenched the fold of his tunic and his eyes were shrouded in darkness[472] as the life went. Next from close in he thrust at Moulios[473] with the pike at the ear, so the bronze spearhead pushed through and came out[474] at the other ear. Now he hit Echeklos the son of Agenor[475] with the hilted sword, hewing against his head in the middle[476] so all the sword was smoking with blood, and over both eyes[477] closed the red death and the strong destiny. Now Deukalion[478] was struck in the arm, at a place in the elbow where the tendons[479] come together. There through the arm Achilleus transfixed him[480] with the bronze spearhead, and he, arm hanging heavy, waited[481] and looked his death in the face. Achilleus struck with the sword’s edge[482] at his neck, and swept the helmed head far away, and the marrow[483] gushed from the neckbone, and he went down to the ground at full length.[484] Now he went on after the blameless son of Peires,[485] Rhigmos, who had come over from Thrace where the soil is rich. This man  p 251  [486] he stabbed in the middle with the spear, and the spear stuck fast in his belly.[487] He dropped from the chariot, but as Areïthoös his henchman[488] turned the horses away Achilleus stabbed him with the sharp spear[489] in the back, and thrust him from the chariot. And the horses bolted.[490] As inhuman fire sweeps on in fury through the deep angles[491] of a drywood mountain and sets ablaze the depth of the timber[492] and the blustering wind lashes the flame along, so Achilleus[493] swept everywhere with his spear like something more than a mortal[494] harrying them as they died, and the black earth ran blood.[495] Or as when a man yokes male broad-foreheaded oxen[496] to crush white barley on a strong-laid threshing floor, and rapidly[497] the barley is stripped beneath the feet of the bellowing oxen,[498] so before great-hearted Achilleus the single-foot horses[499] trampled alike dead man and shields, and the axle under[500] the chariot was all splashed with blood and the rails which encircled[501] the chariot, struck by flying drops from the feet of the horses,[502] from the running rims of the wheels. The son of Peleus was straining[503] to win glory, his invincible hands spattered with bloody filth.book twenty-one[1] But when they came to the crossing place of the fair-running river[2] of whirling Xanthos, a stream whose father was Zeus the immortal,[3] there Achilleus split them and chased some back over the flat land[4] toward the city, where the Achaians themselves had stampeded in terror[5] on the day before, when glorious Hektor was still in his fury.[6] Along this ground they were streaming in flight; but Hera let fall[7] a deep mist before them to stay them. Meanwhile the other half[8] were crowded into the silvery whirls of the deep-running river[9] and tumbled into it in huge clamour, and the steep-running water[10] sounded, and the banks echoed hugely about them, as they out-crying[11] tried to swim this way and that, spun about in the eddies.[12] As before the blast of a fire the locusts escaping[13] into a river swarm in air, and the fire unwearied[14] blazes from a sudden start, and the locusts huddle in water;[15] so before Achilleus the murmuring waters of Xanthos[16] the deep-whirling were filled with confusion of men and of horses.[17] But heaven-descended Achilleus left his spear there on the bank[18] leaning against the tamarisks, and leapt in like some immortal,[19] with only his sword, but his heart was bent upon evil actions,[20] and he struck in a circle around him. The shameful sound of their groaning[21] rose as they were struck with the sword, and the water was reddened[22] with blood. As before a huge-gaping dolphin the other fishes[23] escaping cram the corners of a deepwater harbour[24] in fear, for he avidly eats up any he can catch;[25] so the Trojans along the course of the terrible river[26] shrank under the bluffs. He, when his hands grew weary with killing,[27] chose out and took twelve young men alive from the river[28] to be vengeance for the death of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios.[29] These, bewildered with fear like fawns, he led out of the water[30] and bound their hands behind them with thongs well cut out of leather,  p 252  [31] with the very belts they themselves wore on their ingirt tunics,[32] and gave them to his companions to lead away to the hollow ships,[33] then himself whirled back, still in a fury to kill men.[34] And there he came upon a son of Dardanian Priam[35] as he escaped from the river, Lykaon, one whom he himself[36] had taken before and led him unwilling from his father’s gardens[37] on a night foray. He with the sharp bronze was cutting young branches[38] from a fig tree, so that they could make him rails for a chariot,[39] when an unlooked-for evil thing came upon him, the brilliant[40] Achilleus, who that time sold him as slave in strong-founded Lemnos[41] carrying him there by ship, and the son of Jason paid for him;[42] from there a guest and friend who paid a great price redeemed him,[43] Eëtion of Imbros, and sent him to shining Arisbe;[44] and from there he fled away and came to the house of his father.[45] For eleven days he pleasured his heart with friends and family[46] after he got back from Lemnos, but on the twelfth day once again[47] the god cast him into the hands of Achilleus, who this time[48] was to send him down unwilling on his way to the death god.[49] Now as brilliant swift-footed Achilleus saw him and knew him[50] naked and without helm or shield, and he had no spear left[51] but had thrown all these things on the ground, being weary and sweating[52] with the escape from the river, and his knees were beaten with weariness,[53] disturbed, Achilleus spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[54] “Can this be? Here is a strange thing that my eyes look on.[55] Now the great-hearted Trojans, even those I have killed already,[56] will stand and rise up again out of the gloom and the darkness[57] as this man has come back and escaped the day without pity[58] though he was sold into sacred Lemnos; but the main of the grey sea[59] could not hold him, though it holds back many who are unwilling.[60] But come now, he must be given a taste of our spearhead[61] so that I may know inside my heart and make certain[62] whether he will come back even from there, or the prospering[63] earth will hold him, she who holds back even the strong man.”[64] So he pondered, waiting, and the other in terror came near him[65] in an agony to catch at his knees, and the wish in his heart was[66] to get away from the evil death and the dark fate. By this[67] brilliant Achilleus held the long spear uplifted above him[68] straining to stab, but he under-ran the stroke and caught him[69] by the knees, bending, and the spear went over his back and stood fast[70] in the ground, for all its desire to tear a man’s flesh. Lykaon[71] with one hand had taken him by the knees in supplication[72] and with the other held and would not let go of the edged spear[73] and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words: “Achilleus,[74] I am at your knees. Respect my position, have mercy upon me.[75] I am in the place, illustrious, of a suppliant who must be honoured,[76] for you were the first beside whom I tasted the yield of Demeter[77] on that day you captured me in the strong-laid garden[78] and took me away from my father and those near me, and sold me[79] away into sacred Lemnos, and a hundred oxen I fetched you.[80] My release was ransom three times as great; and this is[81] the twelfth dawn since I came back to Ilion, after[82] much suffering. Now again cursed destiny has put me  p 253  [83] in your hands; and I think I must be hated by Zeus the father[84] who has given me once more to you, and my mother bore me[85] to a short life, Laothoë, daughter of aged Altes,[86] Altes, lord of the Leleges, whose delight is in battle,[87] and holds headlong Pedasos on the river Satnioeis.[88] His daughter was given to Priam, who had many wives beside her.[89] We are two who were born to her. You will have cut the throats[90] of both, since one you beat down in the forefront of the foot-fighters,[91] Polydoros the godlike, with a cast of the sharp spear. This time[92] the evil shall be mine in this place, since I do not think[93] I shall escape your hands, since divinity drove me against them.[94] Still, put away in your heart this other thing I say to you.[95] Do not kill me. I am not from the same womb as Hektor,[96] he who killed your powerful and kindly companion.”[97] So the glorious son of Priam addressed him, speaking[98] in supplication, but heard in turn the voice without pity:[99] “Poor fool, no longer speak to me of ransom, nor argue it.[100] In the time before Patroklos came to the day of his destiny[101] then it was the way of my heart’s choice to be sparing[102] of the Trojans, and many I took alive and disposed of them.[103] Now there is not one who can escape death, if the gods send[104] him against my hands in front of Ilion, not one[105] of all the Trojans and beyond others the children of Priam.[106] So, friend, you die also. Why all this clamour about it?[107] Patroklos also is dead, who was better by far than you are.[108] Do you not see what a man I am, how huge, how splendid[109] and born of a great father, and the mother who bore me immortal?[110] Yet even I have also my death and my strong destiny,[111] and there shall be a dawn or an afternoon or a noontime[112] when some man in the fighting will take the life from me also[113] either with a spearcast or an arrow flown from the bowstring.”[114] So he spoke, and in the other the knees and the inward[115] heart went slack. He let go of the spear and sat back, spreading[116] wide both hands; but Achilleus drawing his sharp sword struck him[117] beside the neck at the collar-bone, and the double-edged sword[118] plunged full length inside. He dropped to the ground, face downward,[119] and lay at length, and the black blood flowed, and the ground was soaked with it.[120] Achilleus caught him by the foot and slung him into the river[121] to drift, and spoke winged words of vaunting derision over him:[122] “Lie there now among the fish, who will lick the blood away[123] from your wound, and care nothing for you, nor will your mother[124] lay you on the death-bed and mourn over you, but Skamandros[125] will carry you spinning down to the wide bend of the salt water.[126] And a fish will break a ripple shuddering dark on the water[127] as he rises to feed upon the shining fat of Lykaon.[128] Die on, all; till we come to the city of sacred Ilion,[129] you in flight and I killing you from behind; and there will not[130] be any rescue for you from your silvery-whirled strong-running[131] river, for all the numbers of bulls you dedicate to it[132] and drown single-foot horses alive in its eddies. And yet[133] even so, die all an evil death, till all of you  p 254  [134] pay for the death of Patroklos and the slaughter of the Achaians[135] whom you killed beside the running ships, when I was not with them.”[136] He spoke, but the anger was rising now in the heart of the river[137] and he pondered in his heart as to how he could stop the labour[138] of brilliant Achilleus, and fend destruction a way from the Trojans.[139] And now with the spear far shadowing in his hands Peleus’ son[140] was springing, furious to kill him, on Asteropaios[141] the son of Pelegon; who in turn was born of the wide-running river[142] Axios, and of Periboia, eldest of the daughters[143] of Akessamenos, for she lay in love with the deep-whirling river.[144] Against this man Achilleus rose up, and he came out to face him[145] from the river, holding two spears, for Xanthos had inspired valour[146] into his heart, in anger for the slaughter of the young men[147] whom Achilleus had slain beside his waters and taken no pity.[148] Now as these two in their advance encountered together[149] first of the two to speak was swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:[150] “What man are you, and whence, who dare stand up to my onset?[151] Since unhappy are those whose sons match warcraft against me.”[152] Then in turn the glorious son of Pelegon answered him:[153] “High-hearted son of Peleus, why ask of my generation?[154] I am from Paionia far away, where the soil is generous,[155] and lead the men of Paionia with long spears; and this for me[156] is the eleventh day since I arrived in Ilion.[157] For my generation, it is from the broad waters of Axios,[158] Axios, who floods the land with the loveliest waters.[159] His son was Pelegon the spear-famed; but men say I am Pelegon’s[160] son; now, glorious Achilleus, we shall fight together.”[161] So he spoke, challenging, and brilliant Achilleus uplifted[162] the Pelian ash spear, but the warrior Asteropaios[163] threw with both spears at the same time, being ambidextrous.[164] With the one spear he hit the shield but could not altogether[165] break through the shield, since the gold stayed it that the god had given.[166] With the other spear he struck Achilleus on the right forearm[167] and grazed it so that the blood gushed out in a dark cloud, and the spear[168] overpassed him and fixed in the ground, straining to reach his body.[169] Throwing second Achilleus let fly at Asteropaios[170] with the straight-flying ash spear in a fury to kill him,[171] but missed his man and hit the high bank, so that the ash spear[172] was driven half its length and stuck in the bank of the river.[173] But the son of Peleus, drawing from beside his thigh the sharp sword,[174] sprang upon him in fury; and Asteropaios could not[175] with his heavy hand wrench Achilleus’ ash spear free of the river-bank.[176] Three times he struggled straining to wrench it clear, and three times[177] gave over the effort, and now for the fourth time he was bending[178] over the ash spear of Aiakides, trying to break it,[179] but before this Achilleus took his life with the sword from close up[180] for he struck him in the belly next the navel, and all his guts poured[181] out on the ground, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes[182] as he gasped life out, and springing upon his chest Achilleus[183] stripped his armour away and spoke in triumph above him:[184] “Lie so: it is hard even for those sprung of a river[185] to fight against the children of Kronos, whose strength is almighty.  p 255  [186] You said you were of the generation of the wide-running river,[187] but I claim that I am of the generation of great Zeus.[188] The man is my father who is lord over many Myrmidons,[189] Peleus, Aiakos’ son, but Zeus was the father of Aiakos.[190] And as Zeus is stronger than rivers that run to the sea, so[191] the generation of Zeus is made stronger than that of a river.[192] For here is a great river beside you, if he were able[193] to help; but it is not possible to fight Zeus, son of Kronos.[194] Not powerful Acheloios matches his strength against Zeus,[195] not the enormous strength of Ocean with his deep-running waters,[196] Ocean, from whom all rivers are and the entire sea[197] and all springs and all deep wells have their waters of him, yet[198] even Ocean is afraid of the lightning of great Zeus[199] and the dangerous thunderbolt when it breaks from the sky crashing.”[200] So he spoke, and pulled the bronze spear free of the river bluff[201] and left him there, when he had torn the heart of life from him,[202] sprawled in the sands and drenched in the dark water. And about[203] Asteropaios the eels and the other fish were busy[204] tearing him and nibbling the fat that lay by his kidneys.[205] But Achilleus went on after the Paionians crested with horse-hair[206] who had scattered in fear along the banks of the eddying river[207] when they had seen their greatest man in the strong encounter[208] gone down by force under the sword and the hands of Peleïdes.[209] There he killed Thersilochos and Astypylos and Mydon,[210] Mnesos and Thrasios, and Ainios and Ophelestes.[211] Now swift Achilleus would have killed even more Paionians[212] except that the deep-whirling river spoke to him in anger[213] and in mortal likeness, and the voice rose from the depth of the eddies:[214] “O Achilleus, your strength is greater, your acts more violent[215] than all men’s; since always the very gods are guarding you.[216] If the son of Kronos has given all Trojans to your destruction,[217] drive them at least out of me to the plain, and there work your havoc.[218] For the loveliness of my waters is crammed with corpses, I cannot[219] find a channel to cast my waters into the bright sea[220] since I am congested with the dead men you kill so brutally.[221] Let me alone, then; lord of the people, I am confounded.”[222] Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:[223] “All this, illustrious Skamandros, shall be as you order.[224] But I will not leave off my killing of the proud Trojans[225] until I have penned them inside their city, and attempted Hektor[226] strength against strength, until he has killed me or I have killed him.”[227] He spoke, and like something more than mortal swept down on the Trojans.[228] And now the deep-whirling river called aloud to Apollo:[229] “Shame, lord of the silver bow, Zeus’ son; you have not kept[230] the counsels of Kronion, who very strongly ordered you[231] to stand by the Trojans and defend them, until the sun setting[232] at last goes down and darkens all the generous ploughland.”[233] He spoke: and spear-famed Achilleus leapt into the middle water[234] with a spring from the bluff, but the river in a boiling surge was upon him[235] and rose making turbulent all his waters, and pushed off[236] the many dead men whom Achilleus had killed piled in abundance  p 256  [237] in the stream; these, bellowing like a bull, he shoved out[238] on the dry land, but saved the living in the sweet waters[239] hiding them under the huge depths of the whirling current.[240] And about Achilleus in his confusion a dangerous wave rose[241] up, and beat against his shield and pushed it. He could not[242] brace himself with his feet, but caught with his hands at an elm tree[243] tall and strong grown, but this uptorn by the roots and tumbling[244] ripped away the whole cliff and with its dense tangle of roots stopped[245] the run of the lovely current and fallen full length in the water[246] dammed the very stream. Achilleus uprising out of the whirlpool[247] made a dash to get to the plain in the speed of his quick feet[248] in fear, but the great god would not let him be, but rose on him[249] in a darkening edge of water, minded to stop the labour[250] of brilliant Achilleus and fend destruction away from the Trojans.[251] The son of Peleus sprang away the length of a spearcast[252] running with the speed of the black eagle, the marauder[253] who is at once the strongest of flying things and the swiftest.[254] In the likeness of this he sped away, on his chest the bronze armour[255] clashed terribly, and bending away to escape from the river[256] he fled, but the river came streaming after him in huge noise.[257] And as a man running a channel from a spring of dark water[258] guides the run of the water among his plants and his gardens[259] with a mattock in his hand and knocks down the blocks in the channel;[260] in the rush of the water all the pebbles beneath are torn loose[261] from place, and the water that has been dripping suddenly jets on[262] in a steep place and goes too fast even for the man who guides it;[263] so always the crest of the river was overtaking Achilleus[264] for all his speed of foot, since gods are stronger than mortals.[265] And every time swift-footed brilliant Achilleus would begin[266] to turn and stand and fight the river, and try to discover[267] if all the gods who hold the wide heaven were after him, every[268] time again the enormous wave of the sky-fed river[269] would strike his shoulders from above. He tried, in his desperation,[270] to keep a high spring with his feet, but the river was wearing his knees out[271] as it ran fiercely beneath him and cut the ground from under[272] his feet. Peleïdes groaned aloud, gazing into the wide sky:[273] “Father Zeus, no god could endure to save me from the river[274] who am so pitiful. And what then shall become of me?[275] It is not so much any other Uranian god who has done this[276] but my own mother who beguiled me with falsehoods, who told me[277] that underneath the battlements of the armoured Trojans[278] I should be destroyed by the flying shafts of Apollo.[279] I wish now Hektor had killed me, the greatest man grown in this place.[280] A brave man would have been the slayer, as the slain was a brave man.[281] But now this is a dismal death I am doomed to be caught in,[282] trapped in a big river as if I were a boy and a swineherd[283] swept away by a torrent when he tries to cross in a rainstorm.”[284] So he spoke, and Poseidon and Athene swiftly came near him[285] and stood beside him with their shapes in the likeness of mortals[286] and caught him hand by hand and spoke to him in assurance.[287] First of them to speak was the shaker of the earth, Poseidon.[288] “Do not be afraid, son of Peleus, nor be so anxious,  p 257  [289] such are we two of the gods who stand beside you to help you,[290] by the consent of Zeus, myself and Pallas Athene.[291] Thereby it is not your destiny to be killed by the river,[292] but he shall be presently stopped, and you yourself shall behold it.[293] “But we also have close counsel to give you, if you will believe us.[294] Do not let stay your hands from the collision of battle[295] until you have penned the people of Troy, those who escape you,[296] inside the famed wall of Ilion. Then when you have taken Hektor’s life[297] go back again to the ships. We grant you the winning of glory.”[298] So speaking the two went back again among the immortals,[299] but Achilleus went on, and the urgency of the gods strongly stirred him,[300] into the plain. But the river filled with an outrush of water[301] and masses of splendid armour from the young men who had perished[302] floated there, and their bodies, but against the hard drive of the river[303] straight on he kept a high spring with his feet, and the river wide running[304] could not stop him now, since he was given great strength by Athene.[305] But Skamandros did not either abate his fury, but all the more[306] raged at Peleion, and high uplifting the wave of his waters[307] gathered it to a crest, and called aloud upon Simoeis:[308] “Beloved brother, let even the two of us join to hold back[309] the strength of a man, since presently he will storm the great city[310] of lord Priam. The Trojans cannot stand up to him in battle.[311] But help me beat him off with all speed, and make full your currents[312] with water from your springs, and rouse up all of your torrents[313] and make a big wave rear up and wake the heavy confusion[314] and sound of timbers and stones, so we can stop this savage man[315] who is now in his strength and rages in fury like the immortals.[316] For I say that this strength will not be enough for him nor his beauty[317] nor his arms in their splendour, which somewhere deep down under the waters[318] shall lie folded under the mud; and I will whelm his own body[319] deep, and pile it over with abundance of sands and rubble[320] numberless, nor shall the Achaians know where to look for[321] his bones to gather them, such ruin will I pile over him.[322] And there shall his monument be made, and he will have no need[323] of any funeral mound to be buried in by the Achaians.”[324] He spoke, and rose against Achilleus, turbulent, boiling[325] to a crest, muttering in foam and blood and dead bodies[326] until the purple wave of the river fed from the bright sky[327] lifted high and caught in its waters the son of Peleus.[328] But Hera, greatly fearing for Achilleus, cried in a loud voice[329] lest he be swept away in the huge deep-eddying river,[330] and at once thereafter appealed to her own dear son, Hephaistos:[331] “Rise up, god of the dragging feet, my child; for we believe[332] that whirling Xanthos would be fit antagonist for you in battle.[333] Go now quickly to the help of Achilleus, make shine a great flame[334] while I raise up and bring in out of the sea a troublesome[335] storm of the west wind and the whitening south wind, a storm[336] that will burn the heads of the Trojans and burn their armour[337] carrying the evil flame, while you by the banks of Xanthos[338] set fire to the trees and throw fire on the river himself, and do not[339] by any means let him turn you with winning words or revilements.  p 258  [340] Do not let your fury be stopped until such time as[341] I lift my voice and cry to you. Then stay your weariless burning.”[342] Hera spoke, and Hephaistos set on them an inhuman fire.[343] First he kindled a fire in the plain and burned the numerous[344] corpses that lay there in abundance, slain by Achilleus,[345] and all the plain was parched and the shining water was straitened.[346] As when the north wind of autumn suddenly makes dry[347] a garden freshly watered and makes glad the man who is tending it,[348] so the entire flat land was dried up with Hephaistos burning[349] the dead bodies. Then he turned his flame in its shining[350] into the river. The elms burned, the willows and tamarisks,[351] the clover burned and the rushes and the galingale, all those[352] plants that grew in abundance by the lovely stream of the river.[353] The eels were suffering and the fish in the whirl of the water[354] who leaped out along the lovely waters in every direction[355] in affliction under the hot blast of resourceful Hephaistos.[356] The strength of the river was burning away; he gave voice and called out[357] by name: “Hephaistos, not one of the gods could stand up against you.[358] I for one could not fight the flame of a fire like this one.[359] Leave your attack. Brilliant Achilleus can capture the city[360] of the Trojans, now, for me. What have I to do with this quarrel?”[361] He spoke, blazing with fire, and his lovely waters were seething.[362] And as a cauldron that is propped over a great fire boils up[363] dancing on its whole circle with dry sticks burning beneath it[364] as it melts down the fat of swine made tender, so Xanthos’[365] lovely streams were burned with the fire, and the water was boiling[366] and would not flow along but was stopped under stress of the hot blast[367] strongly blown by resourceful Hephaistos. And now the river[368] cried out to Hera in the winged words of strong supplication:[369] “Hera, why did your son assault me to trouble my waters[370] beyond others’? It is not so much I who have done anything against you[371] as all the rest of the gods who stand by to help the Trojans.[372] Now indeed I will leave off, if such is your order,[373] but let him leave off too, I will swear you a promise[374] not ever to drive the day of evil a way from the Trojans,[375] not even when all the city of Troy is burned in the ravening[376] fire, on that day when the warlike sons of the Achaians burn it.”[377] Now when the goddess of the white arms, Hera, had heard this[378] immediately she spoke to her own dear son, Hephaistos:[379] “Hephaistos, hold, my glorious child, since it is not fitting[380] to batter thus an immortal god for the sake of mortals.”[381] So she spoke, and Hephaistos quenched his inhuman fire. Now[382] the lovely waters ran their ripples back in the channel.[383] But when the strength of Xanthos had been beaten, these two gods[384] rested, since Hera, for all she was still angry, restrained them.[385] But upon the other gods descended the wearisome burden[386] of hatred, and the wind of their fury blew from division,[387] and they collided with a grand crash, the broad earth echoing[388] and the huge sky sounded as with trumpets. Zeus heard it[389] from where he sat on Olympos, and was amused in his deep heart[390] for pleasure, as he watched the gods’ collision in conflict.[391] Thereafter they stood not long apart from each other, for Ares  p 259  [392] began it, the shield-stabber, and rose up against Athene[393] with the brazen spear in his hand, and spoke a word of revilement:[394] “Why once more, you dogfly, have you stirred up trouble among the gods[395] with the blast of your blown fury, and the pride of your heart driving you?[396] Do you not remember how you set on Diomedes, Tydeus’[397] son, to spear me, and yourself laying hold of the far-seen pike[398] pushed it straight into me and tore my skin in its beauty.[399] So now I am minded to pay you back for all you have done me.”[400] He spoke, and stabbed against the ghastly aegis with fluttering[401] straps, which gives way not even before the bolt of Zeus’ lightning.[402] There blood-dripping Ares made his stab with the long spear,[403] but Athene giving back caught up in her heavy hand a stone[404] that lay in the plain, black and rugged and huge, one which men[405] of a former time had set there as boundary mark of the cornfield.[406] With this she hit furious Ares in the neck, and unstrung him.[407] He spread over seven acres in his fall, and his hair dragged[408] in the dust, and his armour clashed. But Pallas Athene laughing[409] stood above him and spoke to him in the winged words of triumph:[410] “You child; you did not think even this time how much stronger[411] I can claim I am than you, when you match your fury against me.[412] Therefore you are paying atonement to your mother’s furies[413] since she is angry and wishes you ill, because you abandoned[414] the Achaians, and have given your aid to the insolent Trojans.”[415] She spoke, and turned the shining of her eyes away. But taking[416] Ares by the hand the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite,[417] led him away, groaning always, his strength scarce gathered back into him.[418] But now, as the goddess of the white arms, Hera, noticed her[419] immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:[420] “For shame now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.[421] Here again is this dogfly leading murderous Ares[422] out of the fighting land through the confusion. Quick, go after her!”[423] She spoke, and Athene swept in pursuit, heart full of gladness,[424] and caught up with her and drove a blow at her breasts with her ponderous[425] hand, so that her knees went slack and the heart inside her.[426] Those two both lay sprawled on the generous earth. But Athene[427] stood above them and spoke to them in the winged words of triumph:[428] “Now may all who bring their aid to the Trojans be in[429] such case as these, when they do battle with the armoured Argives,[430] as daring and as unfortunate, as now Aphrodite[431] came companion in arms to Ares, and faced my fury.[432] So we should long ago have rested after our fighting[433] once having utterly stormed the strong-founded city of Ilion.”[434] She spoke, and the goddess of the white arms, Hera, smiled on her.[435] But now the powerful shaker of the earth spoke to Apollo:[436] “Phoibos, why do you and I stand yet apart. It does not suit[437] when the others have begun, and it were too shameful if without fighting[438] we go back to the brazen house of Zeus on Olympos.[439] Begin, you; you are younger born than I; it is not well[440] for me to, since I am elder born than you, and know more.[441] Young fool, what a mindless heart you have. Can you not even[442] now remember all the evils we endured here by Ilion,[443] you and I alone of the gods, when to proud Laomedon  p 260  [444] we came down from Zeus and for a year were his servants[445] for a stated hire, and he told us what to do, and to do it?[446] Then I built a wall for the Trojans about their city,[447] wide, and very splendid, so none could break into their city,[448] but you, Phoibos, herded his shambling horn-curved cattle[449] along the spurs of Ida with all her folds and her forests.[450] But when the changing seasons brought on the time for our labour[451] to be paid, then headstrong Laomedon violated and made void[452] all our hire, and sent us away, and sent threats after us.[453] For he threatened to hobble our feet and to bind our arms,[454] to carry us away for slaves in the far-lying islands.[455] He was even going to strip with bronze the ears from both of us.[456] Then you and I took our way back with hearts full of anger[457] and wrath for our hire which he promised us and would not accomplish it.[458] Yet to his people you give now your grace, and you will not[459] try with us to bring destruction on the insolent Trojans[460] evil and complete, with their honoured wives and their children.”[461] In turn the lord who strikes from afar, Apollo, answered him:[462] “Shaker of the earth, you would have me be as one without prudence[463] if I am to fight even you for the sake of insignificant[464] mortals, who are as leaves are, and now flourish and grow warm[465] with life, and feed on what the ground gives, but then again[466] fade away and are dead. Therefore let us with all speed[467] give up this quarrel and let the mortals fight their own battles.”[468] He spoke so and turned away, for he was too modest[469] to close and fight in strength of hand with his father’s brother.[470] But his sister, Artemis of the wild, the lady of wild beasts,[471] scolded him bitterly and spoke a word of revilement:[472] “You run from him, striker from afar. You have yielded Poseidon[473] the victory entire. He can brag, where nothing has happened.[474] Fool, then why do you wear that bow, which is wind and nothing.[475] Let me not hear you in the halls of my father boasting[476] ever again, as you did before among the immortals,[477] that you could match your strength in combat against Poseidon.”[478] So she spoke, but Apollo who strikes from afar said nothing[479] to her; but the august consort of Zeus, full of anger,[480] scolded the lady of showering arrows in words of revilement:[481] “How have you had the daring, you shameless hussy, to stand up[482] and face me? It will be hard for you to match your strength with mine[483] even if you wear a bow, since Zeus has made you a lion[484] among women, and given you leave to kill any at your pleasure.[485] Better for you to hunt down the ravening beasts in the mountains[486] and deer of the wilds, than try to fight in strength with your betters.[487] But if you would learn what fighting is, come on. You will find out[488] how much stronger I am when you try to match strength against me.”[489] She spoke, and caught both of her arms at the wrists in her left hand[490] and with her right hand stripped away the bow from her shoulders,[491] then with her own bow, smiling, boxed her ears as Artemis[492] tried to twist away, and the flying arrows were scattered.[493] She got under and free and fled in tears, as a pigeon[494] in flight from a hawk wings her way into some rock-hollow[495] and a cave, since it was not destiny for the hawk to catch her.  p 261  [496] So she left her archery on the ground, and fled weeping.[497] Meanwhile the Guide, Argeïphontes, addressed him to Leto:[498] “Leto, I will not fight with you; since it is a hard thing[499] to come to blows with the brides of Zeus who gathers the clouds. No,[500] sooner you may freely speak among the immortal[501] gods, and claim that you were stronger than I, and beat me.”[502] So he spoke, but Leto picked up the curved bow and the arrows[503] which had fallen in the turn of the dust one way and another.[504] When she had taken up the bow she went back to her daughter.[505] But the maiden came to the bronze-founded house on Olympos[506] of Zeus, and took her place kneeling at the knees of her father[507] and the ambrosial veil trembled about her. Her father[508] Kronides caught her against him, and laughed softly, and questioned her:[509] “Who now of the Uranian gods, dear child, has done such[510] things to you, rashly, as if you were caught doing something wicked?”[511] Artemis sweet-garlanded lady of clamours answered him:[512] “It was your wife, Hera of the white arms, who hit me,[513] father, since hatred and fighting have fastened upon the immortals.”[514] Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile[515] Phoibos Apollo went into the sacred city of Ilion,[516] since he was concerned for the wall of the strong-founded city[517] lest the Danaans storm it on that day, before they were fated.[518] The rest of the gods who live forever went back to Olympos,[519] some in anger and others glorying greatly, and sat down[520] at the side of their father the dark-misted. Meanwhile Achilleus[521] was destroying alike the Trojans themselves and their single-foot horses;[522] and as when smoke ascending goes up into the wide sky[523] from a burning city, with the anger of the gods let loose upon it[524] which inflicted labour upon them all, and sorrow on many,[525] so Achilleus inflicted labour and sorrow upon the Trojans.[526] The aged Priam had taken his place on the god-built bastion,[527] and looked out and saw gigantic Achilleus, where before him[528] the Trojans fled in the speed of their confusion, no war strength[529] left them. He groaned and descended to the ground from the bastion[530] and beside the wall set in motion the glorious guards of the gateway;[531] “Hold the gates wide open in your hands, so that our people[532] in their flight can get inside the city, for here is Achilleus[533] close by, stampeding them, and I think there will be disaster.[534] But once they are crowded inside the city and get wind again,[535] shut once more the door-leaves closely fitted together.[536] I am afraid this ruinous man may spring into our stronghold.”[537] He spoke, and they spread open the gates and shoved back the door bars[538] and the gates opening let in daylight. Meanwhile Apollo[539] sprang out to meet them, so that he could fend off destruction[540] from the Trojans, who, straight for the city and the lift of the rampart[541] dusty from the plain and throats rugged with thirst, fled[542] away, and Achilleus followed fiercely with the spear, strong madness[543] forever holding his heart and violent after his glory.[544] There the sons of the Achaians might have taken gate-towering Ilion[545] had not Phoibos Apollo sent on them brilliant Agenor,[546] a man who was the son of Antenor, blameless and powerful.[547] He drove courage into his heart, and stood there beside him  p 262  [548] in person, so as to beat the dragging death spirits from him,[549] and leaned there on an oak tree with close mist huddled about him.[550] When Agenor was aware of Achilleus, sacker of cities,[551] he stood fast, but the heart was a storm in him as he waited.[552] and deeply disturbed he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[553] “Ah me! if I run away before the strength of Achilleus[554] in the way that others are stampeded in terror before him,[555] he will catch me even so and cut my throat like a coward’s.[556] But if I leave these men to be driven in flight by Achilleus,[557] Peleus’ son, and run on my feet in another direction[558] away from the wall to the plain of Ilion, until I come to[559] the spurs of Ida, and take cover there within the undergrowth,[560] then in the evening, when I have bathed in the river, and washed off[561] the sweat, I could make my way back again to Ilion.[562] Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?[563] This way, he might see me as I started to the plain from the city,[564] and go in pursuit, and in the speed of his feet overtake me.[565] Then there will be no way to escape death and the death spirits.[566] He is too strong, his strength is beyond all others’. But then if[567] I go out in front of the city and stand fast against him,[568] I think even his body might be torn by the sharp bronze.[569] There is only one life in him, and people say he is mortal.[570] It is only that Zeus, the son of Kronos, is granting him glory.”[571] He spoke, and gathered himself to await Achilleus, and in him[572] the fighting heart was urgent for the encounter of battle.[573] But as a leopard emerges out of her timbered cover[574] to face the man who is hunting her, and takes no terror[575] in her heart nor thought of flight when she hears them baying against her;[576] and even though one be too quick for her with spear thrust or spear thrown[577] stuck with the shaft though she be she will not give up her fighting[578] fury, till she has closed with one of them or is overthrown;[579] so the son of proud Antenor, brilliant Agenor[580] was unwilling to run away until he had tested Achilleus,[581] but held the perfect circle of his shield in front of him,[582] and with the spear aimed at him and cried out in a great voice:[583] “You must have hoped within your heart, o shining Achilleus,[584] on this day to storm the city of the proud Trojans.[585] You fool! There is much hard suffering to be done for its winning,[586] since there are many of us inside, and men who are fighters,[587] who will stand before our beloved parents, our wives and our children,[588] to defend Ilion; but in this place you will find your destiny,[589] for all you are so headlong and so bold a warrior.”[590] He spoke, and from his heavy hand let fly with the sharp spear[591] and struck him in the leg below the knee, nor entirely[592] missed him, and taking the spear of greave of new-wrought tin clattered[593] horribly, and back from the struck greave the bronze rebounded[594] without getting through, but the gift of the god defended Achilleus.[595] After him Peleus’ son made his spring at godlike Agenor,[596] but Apollo would no further grant him the winning of glory[597] but caught Agenor away closing him in a dense mist[598] and sent him to make his way quietly out of the battle.[599] Then by deception he kept Peleion away from the people.  p 263  [600] The striker from afar likened himself in all ways to Agenor[601] and stood there before his feet, and Achilleus sprang in chase of him[602] in the speed of his feet; for the time he chased him across the wheat-bearing[603] plain, turning him toward the deep whirls of the river Skamandros[604] as he ran a little in front; with the trick Apollo beguiled him[605] so that he hoped ever by running to catch up with him;[606] all this time the rest of the Trojans fled in a body[607] gladly into the town, and the city was filled with their swarming.[608] They dared no longer outside the wall and outside the city[609] to wait for each other and find out which one had got away[610] and who had died in the battle, so hastily were they streaming[611] into the city, each man as his knees and feet could rescue him.book twenty-two[1] So along the city the Trojans, who had run like fawns, dried[2] the sweat off from their bodies and drank and slaked their thirst, leaning[3] along the magnificent battlements. Meanwhile the Achaians[4] sloping their shields across their shoulders came close to the rampart.[5] But his deadly fate held Hektor shackled, so that he stood fast[6] in front of Ilion and the Skaian gates. Now Phoibos[7] Apollo spoke aloud to Peleion: “Why, son of Peleus,[8] do you keep after me in the speed of your feet, being mortal[9] while I am an immortal god? Even yet you have not[10] seen that I am a god, but strain after me in your fury.[11] Now hard fighting with the Trojans whom you stampeded means nothing[12] to you. They are crowded in the city, but you bent away here.[13] You will never kill me. I am not one who is fated.”[14] Deeply vexed Achilleus of the swift feet spoke to him:[15] “You have balked me, striker from afar, most malignant of all gods,[16] when you turned me here away from the rampart, else many Trojans[17] would have caught the soil in their teeth before they got back into Ilion.[18] Now you have robbed me of great glory, and rescued these people[19] lightly, since you have no retribution to fear hereafter.[20] Else I would punish you, if only the strength were in me.”[21] He spoke, and stalked away against the city, with high thoughts[22] in mind, and in tearing speed, like a racehorse with his chariot[23] who runs lightly as he pulls the chariot over the flat land.[24] Such was the action of Achilleus in feet and quick knees.[25] The aged Priam was the first of all whose eyes saw him[26] as he swept across the flat land in full shining, like that star[27] which comes on in the autumn and whose conspicuous brightness[28] far outshines the stars that are numbered in the night’s darkening,[29] the star they give the name of Orion’s Dog, which is brightest[30] among the stars, and yet is wrought as a sign of evil[31] and brings on the great fever for unfortunate mortals.[32] Such was the flare of the bronze that girt his chest in his running.[33] The old man groaned aloud and with both hands high uplifted[34] beat his head, and groaned amain, and spoke supplicating[35] his beloved son, who there still in front of the gateway[36] stood fast in determined fury to fight with Achilleus.  p 264  [37] The old man stretching his hands out called pitifully to him:[38] “Hektor, beloved child, do not wait the attack of this man[39] alone, away from the others. You might encounter your destiny[40] beaten down by Peleion, since he is far stronger than you are.[41] A hard man: I wish he were as beloved of the immortal[42] as loved by me. Soon he would lie dead, and the dogs and the vultures[43] would eat him, and bitter sorrow so be taken from my heart.[44] He has made me desolate of my sons, who were brave and many.[45] He killed them, or sold them away among the far-lying islands.[46] Even now there are two sons, Lykaon and Polydoros,[47] whom I cannot see among the Trojans pent up in the city,[48] sons Laothoë a princess among women bore to me.[49] But if these are alive somewhere in the army, then I can[50] set them free for bronze and gold; it is there inside, since[51] Altes the aged and renowned gave much with his daughter.[52] But if they are dead already and gone down to the house of Hades,[53] it is sorrow to our hearts, who bore them, myself and their mother,[54] but to the rest of the people a sorrow that will be fleeting[55] beside their sorrow for you, if you go down before Achilleus.[56] Come then inside the wall, my child, so that you can rescue[57] the Trojans and the women of Troy, neither win the high glory[58] for Peleus’ son, and yourself be robbed of your very life. Oh, take[59] pity on me, the unfortunate still alive, still sentient[60] but ill-starred, whom the father, Kronos’ son, on the threshold of old age[61] will blast with hard fate, after I have looked upon evils[62] and seen my sons destroyed and my daughters dragged away captive[63] and the chambers of marriage wrecked and the innocent children taken[64] and dashed to the ground in the hatefulness of war, and the wives[65] of my sons dragged off by the accursed hands of the Achaians.[66] And myself last of all, my dogs in front of my doorway[67] will rip me raw, after some man with stroke of the sharp bronze[68] spear, or with spearcast, has torn the life out of my body;[69] those dogs I raised in my halls to be at my table, to guard my[70] gates, who will lap my blood in the savagery of their anger[71] and then lie down in my courts. For a young man all is decorous[72] when he is cut down in battle and torn with the sharp bronze, and lies there[73] dead, and though dead still all that shows about him is beautiful;[74] but when an old man is dead and down, and the dogs mutilate[75] the grey head and the grey beard and the parts that are secret,[76] this, for all sad mortality, is the sight most pitiful.”[77] So the old man spoke, and in his hands seizing the grey hairs[78] tore them from his head, but could not move the spirit in Hektor.[79] And side by side with him his mother in tears was mourning[80] and laid the fold of her bosom bare and with one hand held out[81] a breast, and wept her tears for him and called to him in winged words:[82] “Hektor, my child, look upon these and obey, and take pity[83] on me, if ever I gave you the breast to quiet your sorrow.[84] Remember all these things, dear child, and from inside the wall[85] beat off this grim man. Do not go out as champion against him,[86] o hard one; for if he kills you I can no longer[87] mourn you on the death-bed, sweet branch, o child of my bearing,  p 265  [88] nor can your generous wife mourn you, but a big way from us[89] beside the ships of the Argives the running dogs will feed on you.”[90] So these two in tears and with much supplication called out[91] to their dear son, but could not move the spirit in Hektor,[92] but he awaited Achilleus as he came on, gigantic.[93] But as a snake waits for a man by his hole, in the mountains,[94] glutted with evil poisons, and the fell venom has got inside him,[95] and coiled about the hole he stares malignant, so Hektor[96] would not give ground but kept unquenched the fury within him[97] and sloped his shining shield against the jut of the bastion.[98] Deeply troubled he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[99] “Ah me! If I go now inside the wall and the gateway,[100] Poulydamas will be first to put a reproach upon me,[101] since he tried to make me lead the Trojans inside the city[102] on that accursed night when brilliant Achilleus rose up,[103] and I would not obey him, but that would have been far better.[104] Now, since by my own recklessness I have ruined my people,[105] I feel shame before the Trojans and the Trojan women with trailing[106] robes, that someone who is less of a man than I will say of me:[107] ‘Hektor believed in his own strength and ruined his people.’[108] Thus they will speak; and as for me, it would be much better[109] at that time, to go against Achilleus, and slay him, and come back,[110] or else be killed by him in glory in front of the city.[111] Or if again I set down my shield massive in the middle[112] and my ponderous helm, and lean my spear up against the rampart[113] and go out as I am to meet Achilleus the blameless[114] and promise to give back Helen, and with her all her possessions,[115] all those things that once in the hollow ships Alexandros[116] brought back to Troy, and these were the beginning of the quarrel;[117] to give these to Atreus’ sons to take away, and for the Achaians[118] also to divide up all that is hidden within the city,[119] and take an oath thereafter for the Trojans in conclave[120] not to hide anything away, but distribute all of it,[121] as much as the lovely citadel keeps guarded within it;[122] yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?[123] I might go up to him, and he take no pity upon me[124] nor respect my position, but kill me naked so, as if I were[125] a woman, once I stripped my armour from me. There is no[126] way any more from a tree or a rock to talk to him gently[127] whispering like a young man and a young girl, in the way[128] a young man and a young maiden whisper together.[129] Better to bring on the fight with him as soon as it may be.[130] We shall see to which one the Olympian grants the glory.”[131] So he pondered, waiting, but Achilleus was closing upon him[132] in the likeness of the lord of battles, the helm-shining warrior,[133] and shaking from above his shoulder the dangerous Pelian[134] ash spear, while the bronze that closed about him was shining[135] like the flare of blazing fire or the sun in its rising.[136] And the shivers took hold of Hektor when he saw him, and he could no longer[137] stand his ground there, but left the gates behind, and fled, frightened,  p 266  [138] and Peleus’ son went after him in the confidence of his quick feet.[139] As when a hawk in the mountains who moves lightest of things flying[140] makes his effortless swoop for a trembling dove, but she slips away[141] from beneath and flies and he shrill screaming close after her[142] plunges for her again and again, heart furious to take her;[143] so Achilleus went straight for him in fury, but Hektor[144] fled away under the Trojan wall and moved his knees rapidly.[145] They raced along by the watching point and the windy fig tree[146] always away from under the wall and along the wagon-way[147] and came to the two sweet-running well springs. There there are double[148] springs of water that jet up, the springs of whirling Skamandros.[149] One of these runs hot water and the steam on all sides[150] of it rises as if from a fire that was burning inside it.[151] But the other in the summer-time runs water that is like hail[152] or chill snow or ice that forms from water. Beside these[153] in this place, and close to them, are the washing-hollows[154] of stone, and magnificent, where the wives of the Trojans and their lovely[155] daughters washed the clothes to shining, in the old days[156] when there was peace, before the coming of the sons of the Achaians.[157] They ran beside these, one escaping, the other after him.[158] It was a great man who fled, but far better he who pursued him[159] rapidly, since here was no festal beast, no ox-hide[160] they strove for, for these are prizes that are given men for their running.[161] No, they ran for the life of Hektor, breaker of horses.[162] As when about the turnposts racing single-foot horses[163] run at full speed, when a great prize is laid up for their winning,[164] a tripod or a woman, in games for a man’s funeral,[165] so these two swept whirling about the city of Priam[166] in the speed of their feet, while all the gods were looking upon them.[167] First to speak among them was the father of gods and mortals:[168] “Ah me, this is a man beloved whom now my eyes watch[169] being chased around the wall; my heart is mourning for Hektor[170] who has burned in my honour many thigh pieces of oxen[171] on the peaks of Ida with all her folds, or again on the uttermost[172] part of the citadel, but now the brilliant Achilleus[173] drives him in speed of his feet around the city of Priam.[174] Come then, you immortals, take thought and take counsel, whether[175] to rescue this man or whether to make him, for all his valour,[176] go down under the hands of Achilleus, the son of Peleus.”[177] Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:[178] “Father of the shining bolt, dark misted, what is this you said?[179] Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since[180] doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?[181] Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.”[182] Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds spoke to her in answer:[183] “Tritogeneia, dear daughter, do not lose heart; for I say this[184] not in outright anger, and my meaning toward you is kindly.[185] Act as your purpose would have you do, and hold back no longer.”[186] So he spoke, and stirred on Athene, who was eager before this,[187] and she went in an flash of speed down the pinnacles of Olympos.[188] But swift Achilleus kept unremittingly after Hektor,[189] chasing him, as a dog in the mountains who has flushed from his covert[190] a deer’s fawn follows him through the folding ways and the valleys,  p 267  [191] and though the fawn crouched down under a bush and be hidden[192] he keeps running and noses him out until he comes on him;[193] so Hektor could not lose himself from swift-footed Peleion.[194] If ever he made a dash right on for the gates of Dardanos[195] to get quickly under the strong-build bastions, endeavouring[196] that they from above with missiles thrown might somehow defend him,[197] each time Achilleus would get in front and force him to turn back[198] into the plain, and himself kept his flying course next the city.[199] As in a dream a man is not able to follow one who runs[200] from him, nor can the runner escape, nor the other pursue him,[201] so he could not run him down in his speed, nor the other get clear.[202] How then could Hektor have escaped the death spirits, had not[203] Apollo, for this last and uttermost time, stood by him[204] close, and driven strength into him, and made his knees light?[205] But brilliant Achilleus kept shaking his head at his own people[206] and would not let them throw their bitter projectiles at Hektor[207] for fear the thrower might win the glory, and himself come second.[208] But when for the fourth time they had come around to the well springs[209] then the Father balanced his golden scales, and in them[210] he set two fateful portions of death, which lays men prostrate,[211] one for Achilleus, and one for Hektor, breaker of horses,[212] and balanced it by the middle; and Hektor’s death-day was heavier[213] and dragged downward toward death, and Phoibos Apollo forsook him.[214] But the goddess grey-eyed Athene came now to Peleion[215] and stood close beside him and addressed him in winged words: “Beloved[216] of Zeus, shining Achilleus, I am hopeful now that you and I[217] will take back great glory to the ships of the Achaians, after[218] we have killed Hektor, for all his slakeless fury for battle.[219] Now there is no way for him to get clear away from us,[220] not though Apollo who strikes from afar should be willing to undergo[221] much, and wallow before our father Zeus of the aegis.[222] Stand you here then and get your wind again, while I go[223] to this man and persuade him to stand up to you in combat.”[224] So spoke Athene, and he was glad at heart, and obeyed her,[225] and stopped, and stood leaning on his bronze-barbed ash spear. Meanwhile[226] Athene left him there, and caught up with brilliant Hektor,[227] and likened herself in form and weariless voice to Deïphobos.[228] She came now and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:[229] “Dear brother, indeed swift-footed Achilleus is using you roughly[230] and chasing you on swift feet around the city of Priam.[231] Come on, then; let us stand fast against him beat him back from us.”[232] Then tall Hektor of the shining answered her: “Deïphobos,[233] before now you were dearest to me by far of my brothers,[234] of all those who were sons of Priam and Hekabe, and now[235] I am minded all the more within my heart to honour you,[236] you who dared for my sake, when your eyes saw me, to come forth[237] from the fortifications, while the others stand fast inside them.”[238] Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:[239] “My brother, it is true our father and the lady our mother, taking[240] my knees in turn, and my companions about me, entreated[241] that I stay within, such was the terror upon all of them.[242] But the heart within me was worn away by hard sorrow for you.[243] But now let us go straight on and fight hard, let there be no sparing  p 268  [244] of our spears, so that we can find out whether Achilleus[245] will kill us both and carry our bloody war spoils back[246] to the hollow ships, or will himself go down under your spear.”[247] So Athene spoke and led him on by beguilement.[248] Now as two in their advance were come close together,[249] first of the two to speak was tall helm-glittering Hektor:[250] “Son of Peleus, I will no longer run from you, as before this[251] I fled three times around the great city of Priam, and dared not[252] stand to your onfall. But now my spirit in turn has driven me[253] to stand and face you. I must take you now, or I must be taken.[254] Come then, shall we swear before the gods? For these are the highest[255] who shall be witnesses and watch over our agreements.[256] Brutal as you are I will not defile you, if Zeus grants[257] to me that I can wear you out, and take the life from you.[258] But after I have stripped your glorious armour, Achilleus,[259] I will give your corpse back to the Achaians. Do you do likewise.”[260] Then looking darkly at him swift-footed Achilleus answered:[261] “Hektor, argue me no agreements. I cannot forgive you.[262] As there are no trustworthy oaths between men and lions,[263] nor wolves and lambs have spirit that can be brought to agreement[264] but forever these hold feelings of hate for each other,[265] so there can be no love between you and me, nor shall there be[266] oaths between us, but one or the other must fall before then[267] to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield’s guard.[268] Remember every valour of yours, for now the need comes[269] hardest upon you to be a spearman and a bold warrior.[270] There shall be no more escape for you, but Pallas Athene[271] will kill you soon by my spear. You will pay in a lump for all those[272] sorrows of any companions you killed in your spear’s fury.”[273] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far shadowed, and threw it;[274] but glorious Hektor kept his eyes on him, and avoided it,[275] for he dropped, watchful, to his knee, and the bronze spear flew over his shoulder[276] and stuck in the ground, but Pallas Athene snatched it, and gave it[277] back to Achilleus, unseen by Hektor shepherd of the people.[278] But now Hektor spoke out to the blameless son of Peleus:[279] “You missed; and it was not, o Achilleus like the immortals,[280] from Zeus that you knew my destiny; but you thought so; or rather[281] you are someone clever in speech and spoke to swindle me,[282] to make me afraid of you and forget my valour and war strength.[283] You will not stick your spear in my back as I run away from you[284] but drive it into my chest as I storm straight in against you;[285] if the god gives you that; and now look out for my brazen[286] spear. I wish it might be taken full length in your body.[287] And indeed the war would be a lighter thing for the Trojans[288] if you were dead, seeing that you are their greatest affliction.”[289] So he spoke, and balanced the spear far shadowed, and threw it,[290] and struck the middle of Peleïdes’ shield, nor missed it,[291] but the spear was driven far back from the shield, and Hektor was angered[292] because his swift weapon had been loosed from his hand in a vain cast.[293] He stood discouraged, and had no other ash spear; but lifting[294] his voice he called aloud on Deïphobos of the pale shield,  p 269  [295] and asked him for a long spear, but Deïphobos was not near him.[296] And Hektor knew the truth inside his heart, and spoke aloud:[297] “No use. Here at last the gods have summoned me deathward.[298] I thought Deïphobos the hero was here close beside me,[299] but he is behind the wall and it was Athene cheating me,[300] and now evil death is close to me, and no longer far away,[301] and there is no way out. So it must long since have been pleasing[302] to Zeus, and Zeus’ son who strikes from afar, this way; though before this[303] they defended me gladly. But now my death is upon me.[304] Let me at least not die without a struggle, inglorious,[305] but do some big thing first, that men to come shall know of it.”[306] So he spoke, and pulling out the sharp sword that was slung[307] at the hollow of his side, huge and heavy, and gathering[308] himself together, he made his swoop, like a high-flown eagle[309] who launches himself out of the murk of the clouds on the flat land[310] to catch away a tender lamb or a shivering hare; so[311] Hektor made his swoop, swinging his sharp sword, and Achilleus[312] charged, the heart within him loaded with savage fury.[313] In front of his chest the beautiful elaborate great shield[314] covered him, and with the glittering helm with four horns[315] he nodded; the lovely golden fringes were shaken about it[316] which Hephaistos had driven close along the horn of the helmet.[317] And as a star moves among stars in the night’s darkening,[318] Hesper, who is the fairest star who stands in the sky, such[319] was the shining from the pointed spear Achilleus was shaking[320] in his right hand with evil intention toward brilliant Hektor.[321] He was eyeing Hektor’s splendid body, to see where it might best[322] give way, but all the rest of the skin was held in the armour,[323] brazen and splendid, he stripped when he cut down the strength of Patroklos;[324] yet showed where the collar-bones hold the neck from the shoulders,[325] the throat, where death of the soul comes most swiftly; in this place[326] brilliant Achilleus drove the spear as he came on in fury,[327] and clean through the soft part of the neck the spearpoint was driven.[328] Yet the ash spear heavy with bronze did not sever the windpipe,[329] so that Hektor could still make exchange of words spoken.[330] But he dropped in the dust, and brilliant Achilleus vaunted above him:[331] “Hektor, surely you thought as you killed Patroklos you would be[332] safe, and since I was far away you thought nothing of me,[333] o fool, for an avenger was left, far greater than he was,[334] behind him and away by the hollow ships. And it was I;[335] and I have broken your strength; on you the dogs and the vultures[336] shall feed and foully rip you; the Achaians will bury Patroklos.”[337] In his weakness Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him:[338] “I entreat you, by your life, by your knees, by your parents,[339] do not let the dogs feed on me by the ships of the Achaians,[340] but take yourself the bronze and gold that are there in abundance,[341] those gifts that my father and the lady my mother will give you,[342] and give my body to be taken home again, so that the Trojans[343] and the wives of the Trojans may give me in death my rite of burning.”[344] But looking darkly at him swift-footed Achilleus answered:[345] “No more entreating of me, you dog, by knees or parents.  p 270  [346] I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me[347] to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the things that[348] you have done to me. So there is no one who can hold the dogs off[349] from your head, not if they bring here and set before me ten times[350] and twenty times the ransom, and promise more in addition,[351] not if Priam son of Dardanos should offer to weigh out[352] your bulk in gold; not even so shall the lady your mother[353] who herself bore you lay you on the death-bed and mourn you:[354] no, but the dogs and the birds will have you all for their feasting.”[355] Then, dying, Hektor of the shining helmet spoke to him:[356] “I know you well as I look upon you, I know that I could not[357] persuade you, since indeed in your breast is a heart of iron.[358] Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods’ curse[359] upon you, on that day when Paris and Phoibos Apollo[360] destroy you in the Skaian gates, for all your valour.”[361] He spoke, and as he spoke the end of death closed in upon him,[362] and the soul fluttering free of the limbs went down into Death’s house[363] mourning her destiny, leaving youth and manhood behind her.[364] Now though he was a dead man brilliant Achilleus spoke to him:[365] “Die: and I will take my own death at whatever time[366] Zeus and the rest of the immortals choose to accomplish it.”[367] He spoke, and pulled the brazen spear from the body, and laid it[368] on one side, and stripped away from the shoulders the bloody[369] armour. And the other sons of the Achaians came running about him,[370] and gazed upon the stature and on the imposing beauty[371] of Hektor; and none stood beside him who did not stab him;[372] and thus they would speak to one another, each looking at his neighbour:[373] “See now, Hektor is much softer to handle than he was[374] when he set the ships ablaze with the burning firebrand.”[375] So as they stood beside him they would speak, and stab him.[376] But now, when he had despoiled the body, swift-footed brilliant[377] Achilleus stood among the Achaians and addressed them in winged words:[378] “Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:[379] since the gods have granted me the killing of this man[380] who has done us much damage, such as not all the others together[381] have done, come, let us go in armour about the city[382] to see if we can find out what purpose is in the Trojans,[383] whether they will abandon their high city, now that this man[384] has fallen, or are minded to stay, though Hektor lives no longer.[385] Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?[386] There is a dead man who lies by the ships, unwept, unburied:[387] Patroklos: and I will not forget him, never so long as[388] I remain among the living and my knees have their spring beneath me.[389] And though the dead forget the dead in the house of Hades,[390] even there I shall still remember my beloved companion.[391] But now, you young men of the Achaians, let us go back, singing[392] a victory song, to our hollow ships; and take this with us.[393] We have won ourselves enormous fame; we have killed the great Hektor[394] whom the Trojans glorified as if he were a god in their city.”[395] He spoke, and now thought of shameful treatment for glorious Hektor.[396] In both of his feet at the back he made holes by the tendons[397] in the space between ankle and heel, and drew thongs of ox-hide through them,  p 271  [398] and fastened them to the chariot so as to let the head drag,[399] and mounted the chariot, and lifted the glorious armour inside it,[400] then whipped the horses to run, and they winged their way unreluctant.[401] A cloud of dust rose where Hektor was dragged, his dark hair was falling[402] about him, and all that head that was once so handsome was tumbled[403] in the dust; since by this time Zeus had given him over[404] to his enemies, to be defiled in the land of his fathers.[405] So all his head was dragged in the dust; and now his mother[406] tore out her hair, and threw the shining veil far from her[407] and raised a great wail as she looked upon her son; and his father[408] beloved groaned pitifully, and all his people about him[409] were taken with wailing and lamentation all through the city.[410] It was most like what would have happened, if all lowering[411] Ilion had been burning top to bottom in fire.[412] His people could scarcely keep the old man in his impatience[413] from storming out of the Dardanian gates; he implored them[414] all, and wallowed in the muck before them calling on each man[415] and naming him by his name: “Give way, dear friends,[416] and let me alone though you care for me, leave me to go out[417] from the city and make my way to the ships of the Achaians.[418] I must be suppliant to this man, who is harsh and violent,[419] and he might have respect for my age and take pity upon it[420] since I am old, and his father also is old, as I am,[421] Peleus, who begot and reared him to be an affliction[422] on the Trojans. He has given us most sorrow, beyond all others,[423] such is the number of my flowering sons he has cut down.[424] But for all of these I mourn not so much, in spite of my sorrow,[425] as for one, Hektor, and the sharp grief for him will carry me downward[426] into Death’s house. I wish he had died in my arms, for that way[427] we two, I myself and his mother who bore him unhappy,[428] might so have glutted ourselves with weeping for him and mourning.”[429] So he spoke, in tears, and beside him mourned the citizens.[430] But for the women of Troy Hekabe led out the thronging[431] chant of sorrow: “Child, I am wretched. What shall my life be[432] in my sorrows, now you are dead, who by day and in the night[433] were my glory in the town, and to all of the Trojans[434] and the women of Troy a blessing throughout the city. They adored you[435] as if you were a god, since in truth you were their high honour[436] while you lived. Now death and fate have closed in upon you.”[437] So she spoke in tears but the wife of Hektor had not yet[438] heard: for no sure messenger had come to her and told her[439] how her husband had held his ground there outside the gates;[440] but she was weaving a web in the inner room of the high house,[441] a red folding robe, and inworking elaborate figures.[442] She called out through the house to her lovely-haired handmaidens[443] to set a great cauldron over the fire, so that there would be[444] hot water for Hektor’s bath as he came back out of the fighting;[445] poor innocent, nor knew how, far from waters for bathing,[446] Pallas Athene had cut him down at the hands of Achilleus.[447] She heard from the great bastion the noise of mourning and sorrow.[448] Her limbs spun, and the shuttle dropped from her hand to the ground. Then[449] she called aloud to her lovely-haired handmaidens: “Come here.  p 272  [450] Two of you come with me, so I can see what has happened.[451] I heard the voice of Hektor’s honoured mother; within me[452] my own heart rising beats in my mouth, my limbs under me[453] are frozen. Surely some evil is near for the children of Priam.[454] May what I say come never close to my ear; yet dreadfully[455] I fear that great Achilleus might have cut off bold Hektor[456] alone, away from the city, and be driving him into the flat land,[457] might put an end to that bitter pride of courage, that always[458] was on him, since he would never stay back where the men were in numbers[459] but break far out in front, and give way in his fury to no man.”[460] So she spoke, and ran out of the house like a raving woman[461] with pulsing heart, and her two handmaidens went along with her.[462] But when she came to the bastion and where the men were gathered[463] she stopped, staring, on the wall; and she saw him[464] being dragged in front of the city, and the running horses[465] dragged him at random toward the hollow ships of the Achaians.[466] The darkness of night misted over the eyes of Andromache.[467] She fell backward, and gasped the life breath from her, and far off[468] threw from her head the shining gear that ordered her headdress,[469] the diadem and the cap, and the holding-band woven together,[470] and the circlet, which Aphrodite the golden once had given her[471] on that day when Hektor of the shining helmet led her forth[472] from the house of Eëtion, and gave numberless gifts to win her.[473] And about her stood thronging her husband’s sisters and the wives of his brothers[474] and these, in her despair for death, held her up among them.[475] But she, when she breathed again and the life was gathered back into her,[476] lifted her voice among the women of Troy in mourning:[477] “Hektor, I grieve for you. You and I were born to a single[478] destiny, you in Troy in the house of Priam, and I[479] in Thebe, underneath the timbered mountain of Plakos[480] in the house of Eëtion, who cared for me when I was little,[481] ill-fated he, I ill-starred. I wish he had never begotten me.[482] Now you go down to the house of Death in the secret places[483] of the earth, and left me here behind in the sorrow of mourning,[484] a widow in your house, and the boy is only a baby[485] who was born to you and me, the unfortunate. You cannot help him,[486] Hektor, any more, since you are dead. Nor can he help you.[487] Though he escape the attack of the Achaians with all its sorrows,[488] yet all his days for your sake there will be hard work for him[489] and sorrows, for others will take his lands away from him. The day[490] of bereavement leaves a child with no agemates to befriend him.[491] He bows his head before every man, his cheeks are bewept, he[492] goes, needy, a boy among his father’s companions,[493] and tugs at this man by the mantle, that man by the tunic,[494] and they pity him, and one gives him a tiny drink from a goblet,[495] enough to moisten his lips, not enough to moisten his palate.[496] But one whose parents are living beats him out of the banquet[497] hitting him with his fists and in words also abuses him:[498] ‘Get out, you! Your father is not dining among us.’[499] And the boy goes away in tears to his widowed mother,  p 273  [500] Astyanax, who in days before on the knees of his father[501] would eat only the marrow or the flesh of sheep that was fattest.[502] And when sleep would come upon him and he was done with his playing,[503] he would go to sleep in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, in a soft[504] bed, with his heart given all its fill of luxury.[505] Now, with his dear father gone, he has much to suffer:[506] he, whom the Trojans have called Astyanax, lord of the city,[507] since it was you alone who defended the gates and the long walls.[508] But now, beside the curving ships, far away from your parents,[509] the writhing worms will feed, when the dogs have had enough of you,[510] on your naked corpse, though in your house there is clothing laid up[511] that is fine-textured and pleasant, wrought by the hands of women.[512] But all of these I will burn up in the fire’s blazing,[513] no use to you, since you will never be laid away in them;[514] but in your honour, from the men of Troy and the Trojan women.”[515] So she spoke, in tears; and the women joined in her mourning.book twenty-three[1] So they were mourning through the city. Meanwhile, the Achaians,[2] after they had made their way back to their ships and the Hellespont,[3] scattered, the rest of them, each man to his own ship. Except[4] Achilleus would not allow the Myrmidons to be scattered,[5] but called out to his companions whose delight was in battle:[6] “Myrmidons, you of the fast horses, my steadfast companions,[7] we must not yet slip free of the chariots our single-foot horses,[8] but with these very horses and chariots we must drive close up[9] to Patroklos and mourn him, since such is the privilege of the perished.[10] Then, when we have taken full satisfaction from the sorrowful[11] dirge, we shall set our horses free, and all of us eat here.”[12] He spoke, and all of them assembled moaned, and Achilleus led them.[13] Three times, mourning, they drove their horses with flowing manes about[14] the body, and among them Thetis stirred the passion for weeping.[15] The sands were wet, and the armour of men was wet with their tears. Such[16] was their longing after Patroklos, who drove men to thoughts of terror.[17] Peleus’ son led the thronging chant of their lamentation,[18] and laid his manslaughtering hands over the chest of his dear friend:[19] “Good-bye, Patroklos. I hail you even in the house of the death god.[20] All that I promised you in time past I am accomplishing,[21] that I would drag Hektor here and give him to the dogs to feed on[22] raw, and before your burning pyre to behead twelve glorious[23] children of the Trojans for my anger over your slaying.”[24] He spoke, and thought of shameful treatment for glorious Hektor.[25] He laid him on his face in the dust by the bier of Menoitios’[26] son. Meanwhile the others took off each man his glittering[27] brazen armour, and all unyoked their proud neighing horses[28] and sat down in their thousands beside the ship of swift-footed[29] Aiakides, who set the funeral feast in abundance[30] before them; and many shining oxen were slaughtered with the stroke[31] of the iron, and many sheep and bleating goats and numerous  p 274  [32] swine with shining teeth and the fat abundant upon them[33] were singed and stretched out across the flame of Hephaistos.[34] The blood ran and was caught in cups all around the dead man.[35] But now the kings of the Achaians brought the swift-footed[36] lord, the son of Peleus, to great Agamemnon, hardly[37] persuading him, since his heart was still angered for his companion.[38] When these had made their way to the shelter of Agamemnon[39] straightway they gave orders to the heralds, the clear crying,[40] to set a great cauldron over the fire, if so they might persuade[41] the son of Peleus to wash away the fifth of the bloodstains,[42] but he denied them stubbornly and swore an oath on it:[43] “No, before Zeus, who is greatest of gods and the highest,[44] there is no right in letting water come near my head, until[45] I have laid Patroklos on the burning pyre, and heaped the mound over him,[46] and cut my hair for him, since there will come no second sorrow[47] like this to my heart again while I am still one of the living.[48] Then let us now give way to the gloomy feast; and with the dawn[49] cause your people to rise, o lord of men Agamemnon,[50] and bring in timber and lay it by, with all that is fitting[51] for the dead man to have when he goes down under the gloom and the darkness,[52] so that with the more speed the unwearying fire may burn him[53] away from our eyes, and the people turn back to that which they must do.”[54] So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him,[55] and in speed and haste they got the dinner ready, and each man[56] feasted, nor was any men’s hunger denied a fair portion.[57] But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,[58] they went away to sleep, each man into his own shelter,[59] but along the beach of the thunderous sea the son of Peleus[60] lay down, groaning heavily, among the Myrmidon numbers[61] in a clear place where the waves washed over the beach; and at that time[62] sleep caught him and was drifted sweetly about him, washing[63] the sorrows out of his mind, for his shining limbs were grown weary[64] indeed, from running in chase of Hektor toward windy Ilion;[65] and there appeared to him the ghost of unhappy Patroklos[66] all in his likeness for stature, and the lovely eyes, and voice,[67] and wore such clothing as Patroklos had worn on his body.[68] The ghost came and stood over his head and spoke a word to him:[69] “You sleep, Achilleus; you have forgotten me; but you were not[70] careless of me when I lived, but only in death. Bury me[71] as quickly as may be, let me pass through the gates of Hades.[72] The souls, the images of dead men, hold me at a distance,[73] and will not let me cross the river and mingle among them,[74] but I wander as I am by Hades’ house of the wide gates.[75] And I call upon you in sorrow, give me your hand; no longer[76] shall I come back from death, once you give me my rite of burning.[77] No longer shall you and I, alive, sit apart from our other[78] beloved companions and make our plans, since the bitter destiny[79] that was given me when I was born has opened its jaws to take me.[80] And you, Achilleus like the gods, have your own destiny;[81] to be killed under the wall of the prospering Trojans. There is one[82] more thing I will say, and ask of you, if you will obey me:  p 275  [83] do not have my bones laid apart from yours, Achilleus,[84] but with them, just as we grew up together in your house,[85] when Menoitios brought me there from Opous, when I was little,[86] and into your house, by reason of a baneful manslaying,[87] on that day when I killed the son of Amphidamas. I was[88] a child only, nor intended it, but was angered over a dice game.[89] There the rider Peleus took me into his own house,[90] and brought me carefully up, and named me to be your henchman.[91] Therefore, let one single vessel, the golden two-handled[92] urn the lady your mother gave you, hold both our ashes.”[93] Then in answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilleus:[94] “How is it, o hallowed head of my brother, you have come back to me[95] here, and tell me all these several things? Yet surely[96] I am accomplishing all, and I shall do as you tell me.[97] But stand closer to me, and let us, if only for a little,[98] embrace, and take full satisfaction from the dirge of sorrow.”[99] So he spoke, and with his own arms reached for him, but could not[100] take him, but the spirit went underground, like vapour,[101] with a thin cry, and Achilleus started awake, staring,[102] and drove his hands together, and spoke, and his words were sorrowful:[103] “Oh, wonder! Even in the house of Hades there is left something,[104] a soul and an image, but there is no real heart of life in it.[105] For all night long the phantom of unhappy Patroklos[106] stood over me in lamentation and mourning, and the likeness[107] to him was wonderful, and it told me each thing I should do.”[108] So he spoke, and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning,[109] and Dawn of the rose fingers showed on them as still they mourned[110] about the forlorn body. Now powerful Agamemnon[111] gave order for men and mules to assemble from all the shelters[112] and bring in timber, and a great man led them in motion,[113] Meriones, the henchman of courtly Idomeneus. These then[114] went out and in their hands carried axes to cut wood[115] and ropes firmly woven, and their mules went on ahead of them.[116] They went many ways, uphill, downhill, sidehill and slantwise:[117] but when they came to the spurs of Ida with all her well springs,[118] they set to hewing with the thin edge of bronze and leaning[119] their weight to the strokes on towering-leafed oak trees that toppled[120] with huge crashing; then the Achaians splitting the timbers[121] fastened them to the mules and these with their feet tore up[122] the ground as they pulled through the dense undergrowth to the flat land.[123] All the woodcutters carried logs themselves; such was the order[124] of Meriones, the henchman of courtly Idomeneus. These then[125] threw down their burdens in order along the beach, where Achilleus[126] had chosen place for a huge grave mound, for himself and Patroklos.[127] Then when on all sides they had thrown down abundance of timber,[128] they sat down where they were, assembled. And now Achilleus[129] gave order at once to the Myrmidons, whose delight was in battle,[130] to belt themselves in bronze and each man to yoke his horses[131] to the chariot. And they rose up and got into their armour[132] and stepped up, charioteer and sideman, into the chariots[133] with the horsemen in front, and behind them came on a cloud of foot-soldiers  p 276  [134] by thousands; and in the midst his companions carried Patroklos.[135] They covered all the corpse under the locks of their hair, which they cut off[136] and dropped on him, and behind them brilliant Achilleus held the head[137] sorrowing, for this was his true friend he escorted toward Hades.[138] When these had come to the place Achilleus had spoken of to them[139] they laid him down, and quickly piled up abundant timber.[140] And now brilliant swift-footed Achilleus remembered one more thing.[141] He stood apart from the pyre and cut off a lock of fair hair[142] which he had grown long to give to the river Spercheios, and gazing[143] in deep distress out over the wine-blue water, he spoke forth:[144] “Spercheios, it was in vain that Peleus my father vowed to you[145] that there, when I had won home to the beloved land of my fathers,[146] I would cut my hair for you and make you a grand and holy[147] sacrifice of fifty rams consecrate to the waters[148] of your springs, where is your holy ground and your smoking altar.[149] So the old man vowed, but you did not accomplish his purpose.[150] Now, since I do not return to the beloved land of my fathers,[151] I would give my hair into the keeping of the hero Patroklos.”[152] He spoke, and laid his hair in the hands of his beloved[153] companion, and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning.[154] And now the light of the sun would have set on their lamentation[155] had not Achilleus soon stood by Agamemnon and spoken:[156] “Son of Atreus, beyond others the people of the Achaians[157] will obey your words. There can be enough, even in mourning.[158] Now cause them to scatter from the fire and bid them make ready[159] their dinner; and we, who are most nearly concerned with the dead man,[160] shall do this work; except only let the leaders stay near us.”[161] Then the lord of men, Agamemnon, when he had heard this,[162] at once caused the people to disperse among the balanced ships,[163] but the close mourners stayed by the place and piled up the timber,[164] and built a pyre a hundred feet long this way and that way,[165] and on the peak of the pyre they laid the body, sorrowful[166] at heart; and in front of it skinned and set in order numbers[167] of fat sheep and shambling horn-curved cattle; and from all[168] great-hearted Achilleus took the fat and wrapped the corpse in it[169] from head to foot, and piled up the skinned bodies about it.[170] Then he set beside him two-handled jars of oil and honey[171] leaning them against the bier, and drove four horses with strong necks[172] swiftly aloft the pyre with loud lamentation. And there were[173] nine dogs of the table that had belonged to the lord Patroklos.[174] Of these he cut the throats of two, and set them on the pyre;[175] and so also killed twelve noble of the great-hearted Trojans[176] with the stroke of bronze, and evil were the thoughts in his heart against them,[177] and let loose the iron fury of the fire to feed on them.[178] Then he groaned, and called by name on his beloved companion:[179] “Good-bye, Patroklos. I hail you even in the house of the death god[180] For all that I promised you in time past I am accomplishing.[181] Here are twelve noble sons of the great-hearted Trojans[182] whom the fire feeds on, all, as it feeds on you. But I will not[183] give Hektor, Priam’s son, to the fire, but the dogs, to feast on.”[184] So he spoke his threat. But the dogs did not deal with Hektor,  p 277  [185] for Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, drove the dogs back from him[186] by day and night, and anointed him with rosy immortal[187] oil, so Achilleus, when he dragged him about, might not tear him.[188] And Phoibos Apollo brought down a darkening mist about him[189] from the sky to the plain, and covered with it all the space that was taken[190] by the dead man, to keep the force of the sun from coming[191] first, and wither his body away by limbs and sinews.[192] But the pyre of the dead Patroklos would not light. Then swift-footed[193] brilliant Achilleus thought of one more thing that he must do.[194] He stood apart form the pyre and made his prayer to the two winds[195] Boreas and Zephyros, north wind and west, and promised them splendid[196] offerings, and much outpouring from a golden goblet entreated them[197] to come, so that the bodies might with best speed burn in the fire[198] and the timber burst into flame. And Iris, hearing his prayer,[199] went swiftly as messenger to the winds for him. Now the winds[200] assembled within the house of storm-blowing Zephyros[201] were taking part in a feast, and Iris paused in her running[202] and stood on the stone doorsill; but they, when their eyes saw her,[203] sprang to their feet, and each one asked her to sit beside him.[204] But she refused to be seated and spoke her word to them: “I must not[205] sit down. I am going back to the running waters of Ocean[206] and the Aithiopians’ land, where they are making grand sacrifice[207] to the immortals; there I, too, shall partake of the sacraments.[208] But Achilleus’ prayer is that Boreas and blustering Zephyros[209] may come to him, and he promises them splendid offerings,[210] so that you may set ablaze the funeral pyre, whereon lies[211] Patroklos, with all Achaians mourning about him.”[212] She spoke so, and went away, and they with immortal[213] clamour rose up, and swept the clouds in confusion before them.[214] They came with a sudden blast upon the sea, and the waves rose[215] under the whistling wind. They came to the generous Troad[216] and hit the pyre, and a huge inhuman blaze rose, roaring.[217] Nightlong they piled the flames on the funeral pyre together[218] and blew with a screaming blast, and nightlong swift-footed Achilleus[219] from a golden mixing-bowl, with a two-handled goblet in his hand,[220] drew the wine and poured it on the ground and drenched the ground with it,[221] and called upon the soul of unhappy Patroklos. And as[222] a father mourns as he burns the bones of a son, who was married[223] only now, and died to grieve his unhappy parents,[224] so Achilleus was mourning as he burned his companion’s[225] bones, and dragged himself by the fire in close lamentation.[226] At that time when the dawn star passes across earth, harbinger[227] of light, and after him dawn of the saffron mantle is scattered[228] across the sea, the fire died down and the flames were over.[229] The winds took their way back toward home again, crossing[230] the Thracian water, and it boiled with a moaning swell as they crossed it.[231] The son of Peleus turned aside and away from the burning[232] and lay down exhausted, and sweet sleep rose upon him. But now[233] they who were with the son of Atreus assembled together[234] and the sound and murmur of their oncoming wakened Achilleus,[235] who straightened himself and sat upright and spoke a word to him:[236] “Son of Atreus, and you other greatest of all the Achaians,  p 278  [237] first put out with gleaming wine the pyre that is burning,[238] all that still has on it the fury of fire; and afterwards[239] we shall gather up the bones of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios,[240] which we shall easily tell apart, since they are conspicuous[241] where he lay in the middle of the pyre and the others far from him[242] at the edge burned, the men indiscriminately with the horses.[243] And let us lay his bones in a golden jar and a double[244] fold of fat, until I myself enfold him in Hades.[245] And I would have you build a grave mound which is not very great[246] but such as will be fitting, for now; afterwards the Achaians[247] can make it broad and high—such of you Achaians as may be[248] left to survive me here by the benched ships, after I am gone.”[249] So he spoke, and they did as swift-footed Peleion told them.[250] First with gleaming wine they put out the pyre that was burning,[251] as much as was still aflame, and the ashes dropped deep from it.[252] Then they gathered up the white bones of their gentle companion,[253] weeping, and put them into a golden jar with a double[254] fold of fat, and laid it away in his shelter, and covered it[255] with a thin veil; then laid out the tomb and cast down the holding walls[256] around the funeral pyre, then heaped the loose earth over them[257] and piled the tomb, and turned to go away. But Achilleus[258] held the people there, and made them sit down in a wide assembly,[259] and brought prizes for games out of his ships, cauldrons and tripods,[260] and horses and mules and the powerful high heads of cattle[261] and fair-girdled women and grey iron. First of all[262] he set forth the glorious prizes for speed of foot for the horsemen:[263] a woman faultless in the work of her hands to lead away[264] and a tripod with ears and holding twenty-two measures[265] for the first prize; and for the second he set forth a six-year-old[266] unbroken mare who carried a mule foal within her.[267] Then for the third prize he set forth a splendid unfired[268] cauldron, which held four measures, with its natural gloss still upon it.[269] For the fourth place he set out two talents’ weight of gold, and for[270] the fifth place set forth an unfired jar with two handles.[271] He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:[272] “Son of Atreus and all you other strong-greaved Achaians,[273] these prizes are in the place of games and wait for the horsemen.[274] Now if we Achaians were contending for the sake of some other[275] hero, I myself should take the first prize away to my shelter.[276] You know how much my horses surpass in their speed all others;[277] yes, for they are immortal horses, and Poseidon gave them[278] to Peleus my father, who in turn gave them into my hands.[279] But I stay here at the side, and my single-foot horses stay with me;[280] such is the high glory of the charioteer they have lost,[281] the gentle one, who so many times anointed their manes with[282] soft olive oil, after he had washed them in shining water.[283] Therefore these two horses stand here and grieve, and their manes[284] are swept along the ground as they stand with hearts full of sorrow.[285] But take, the rest of you, places in the field, whichever Achaian[286] has confidence in his horses and his compacted chariot.”[287] So spoke the son of Peleus, and the swift riders gathered.[288] Far the first to rise up was the lord of men Eumelos,  p 279  [289] own son of Admetos, who surpassed in horsemanship. After[290] him rose up the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,[291] and led under the yoke the Trojan horses whom he had taken[292] by force from Aineias, but Aineias himself was saved by Apollo.[293] After him rose the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaos[294] the sky-descended, and led beneath the yoke the swift horses,[295] Aithe, Agamemnon’s mare, and his own Podargos.[296] Echepolos, son of Anchises, gave her to Agamemnon[297] as a gift, so as not to have to go with him to windy Ilion[298] but stay where he was and enjoy himself, since Zeus had given him[299] great wealth, and he made his home in the wide spaces of Sikyon.[300] This mare, who was straining hard for the race, Menelaos harnessed.[301] Fourth to order his horses with flowing manes was Antilochos,[302] the glorious son of Nestor, Neleus’ son, the high-hearted[303] lord, and fast-running horses out of the breed of Pylos[304] pulled his chariot, and his father standing close beside him[305] gave well-intentioned advice to his own good understanding:[306] “Antilochos, you are young indeed, but Zeus and Poseidon[307] have loved you and taught you horsemanship in all of its aspects.[308] Therefore there is no great need to instruct you; you yourself[309] know well how to double the turning-post. Yet in this race your horses[310] should run slowest. Therefore I think your work will be heavy.[311] The horses of these men are faster, but they themselves do not[312] understand any more than you of the science of racing.[313] Remember then, dear son, to have your mind full of every[314] resource of skill, so that the prizes may not elude you.[315] The woodcutter is far better for skill than he is for brute strength.[316] It is by skill that the sea captain holds his rapid ship[317] on its course, though torn by winds, over the wine-blue water.[318] By skill charioteer outpasses charioteer. He[319] who has put all his confidence in his horses and chariot[320] and recklessly makes a turn that is loose one way or another[321] finds his horses drifting out of the course and does not control them.[322] But the man, though he drive the slower horses, who takes his advantage,[323] keeps his eye always on the post and turns tight, ever watchful,[324] pulled with the ox-hide reins on the course, as in the beginning,[325] and holds his horses steady in hand, and watches the leader.[326] I will give you a clear mark and you cannot fail to notice it.[327] There is a dry stump standing up from the ground about six feet,[328] oak, it may be, or pine, and not rotted away by rain-water,[329] and two white stones are leaned against it, one on either side,[330] at the joining place of the ways, and there is smooth driving around it.[331] Either it is the grave-mark of someone who died long ago,[332] or was set as a racing goal by men who lived before our time.[333] Now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus has made it the turning-post.[334] You must drive your chariot and horses so as to hug this,[335] and yourself, in the strong-fabricated chariot, lean over[336] a little to the left of the course, and as for your right horse, whip him[337] and urge him along, slacking your hands to give him his full rein,[338] but make your left-hand horse keep hard against the turning-post[339] so that the hub’s edge of your fashioned wheel will seem to be[340] touching it, yet take care not really to brush against it,  p 280  [341] for, if so, you might damage your horses and break your chariot,[342] and that will be a thing of joy for the others, and a failure[343] for you. So, dear son, drive thoughtfully and be watchful.[344] For if you follow the others but get first by the turning-post,[345] there is none who could sprint to make it up, nor close you, nor pass you,[346] not if the man behind you were driving the great Arion,[347] the swift horse of Adrestos, whose birth is from the immortals,[348] or Laomedon’s horses, who were the pride of those raised in this country.”[349] So spoke Nestor the son of Neleus, and turned back to his place[350] and sat down, having talked to his son of each stage in the contest.[351] Fifth to order his horses with flowing manes was Meriones.[352] They climbed to the chariots and deposited the lots. Achilleus[353] shook them, and the first to fall out was that of Antilochos,[354] Nestor’s son, and strong Eumelos drew next after him,[355] and after him the son of Atreus, Menelaos the spear-famed.[356] Meriones drew the next lane to drive, and the last for the driving[357] of horses was drawn by far the best of them all, Diomedes.[358] They stood in line for the start, and Achilleus showed them the turn-post[359] far away on the level plain, and beside it he stationed[360] a judge, Phoinix the godlike, the follower of his father,[361] to mark and remember the running and bring back a true story.[362] Then all held their whips high-lifted above their horses,[363] then struck with the whip thongs and in words urged their horses onward[364] into speed. Rapidly they made their way over the flat land[365] and presently were far away from the ships. The dust lifting[366] clung beneath the horses’ chests like cloud or a stormwhirl.[367] Their manes streamed along the blast of the wind, the chariots[368] rocking now would dip to the earth who fosters so many[369] and now again would spring up clear of the ground, and the drivers[370] stood in the chariots, with the spirit beating in each man[371] with the strain to win, and each was calling aloud upon his own[372] horses, and the horses flew through the dust of the flat land.[373] But as the rapid horses were running the last of the race-course[374] back, and toward the grey sea, then the mettle of each began to[375] show itself, and the field of horses strung out, and before long[376] out in front was the swift-stepping team of the son of Pheres,[377] Eumelos, and after him the stallions of Diomedes,[378] the Trojan horses, not far behind at all, but close in him,[379] for they seemed forever on the point of climbing his chariot[380] and the wind of them was hot on the back and on the broad shoulders[381] of Eumelos. They lowered their heads and flew close after him.[382] And now he might have passed him or run to a doubtful decision,[383] had not Phoibos Apollo been angry with Diomedes,[384] Tydeus’ son, and dashed the shining whip from his hands, so[385] that the tears began to stream from his eyes, for his anger[386] as he watched how the mares of Eumelos drew far ahead of him[387] while his own horses ran without the whip and were slowed. Yet[388] Athene did not fail to see the foul play of Apollo[389] on Tydeus’ son. She swept in speed to the shepherd of the people[390] and gave him back his whip, and inspired strength into his horses.[391] Then in her wrath she went on after the son of Admetos  p 281  [392] and she, a goddess, smashed his chariot yoke, and his horses[393] ran on either side of the way, the pole dragged, and Eumelos[394] himself was sent spinning out beside the wheel of the chariot[395] so that his elbows were all torn, and his mouth, and his nostrils,[396] and his forehead was lacerated about the brows, and his eyes[397] filled with tears, and the springing voice was held fast within him.[398] Then the son of Tydeus, turning his single-foot horses to pass him,[399] went far out in front of the others, seeing that Athene[400] had inspired strength in his horses and to himself gave the glory.[401] After him came the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaos.[402] But Antilochos cried out aloud to his father’s horses:[403] “Come on, you two. Pull, as fast as you can! I am not[404] trying to make you match your speed with the speed of those others,[405] the horses of Tydeus’ valiant son, to whom now Athene[406] has granted speed and to their rider has given the glory.[407] But make your burst to catch the horses of the son of Atreus[408] nor let them leave you behind, for fear Aithe who is female[409] may shower you in mockery. Are you falling back, my brave horses?[410] For I will tell you this, and it will be a thing accomplished.[411] There will be no more care for you from the shepherd of the people,[412] Nestor, but he will slaughter you out of hand with the edge[413] of bronze, if we win the meaner prize because you are unwilling.[414] Keep on close after him and make all the speed you are able.[415] I myself shall know what to do and contrive it, so that[416] we get by in the narrow place of the way. He will not escape me.”[417] So he spoke, and they fearing the angry voice of their master[418] ran harder for a little while and presently after this[419] battle-stubborn Antilochos saw where the hollow way narrowed.[420] There was a break in the ground where winter water had gathered[421] and broken out of the road, and made a sunken place all about.[422] Menelaos shrinking from a collision of chariots steered there,[423] but Antilochos also turned out his single-foot horses[424] from the road, and bore a little way aside, and went after him;[425] and the son of Atreus was frightened and called out aloud to Antilochos:[426] “Antilochos, this is reckless horsemanship. Hold in your horses.[427] The way is narrow here, it will soon be wider for passing.[428] Be careful not to crash your chariot and wreck both of us.”[429] So he spoke, but Antilochos drove on all the harder[430] with a whiplash for greater speed, as if he had never heard him.[431] As far is the range of discus swung from the shoulder[432] and thrown by a stripling who tries out the strength of his young manhood,[433] so far they ran even, but then the mares of Atreides gave way[434] and fell back, for he of his own will slackened his driving[435] for fear that in the road the single-foot horses might crash[436] and overturn the strong-fabricated chariots, and the men[437] themselves go down in the dust through their hard striving for victory.[438] But Menelaos of the fair hair called to him in anger:[439] “Antilochos, there is no other man more cursed than you are.[440] Damn you. We Achaians lied when we said you had good sense.[441] Even so, you will not get this prize without having to take oath.”[442] He spoke, and lifted his voice and called aloud to his horses:  p 282  [443] “Never hold back now, never stop, for all your hearts are[444] sorrowful. The feet of these and their knees will weary[445] before yours do, seeing that the youth is gone from those horses.”[446] So he spoke, and they fearing the angry voice of their master[447] ran the harder, and soon were close up behind the others.[448] Now the Argives who sat in their assembly were watching[449] the horses, and the horses flew through the dust of the flat land.[450] Idomeneus, lord of the Kretans, was first to make out the horses,[451] for he sat apart from the others assembled, and higher up, where[452] he could see all ways, and from far off he heard Diomedes[453] calling, and knew him, and made out one horse ahead of the others[454] who was conspicuous, all red, except, on his forehead[455] there was a white mark, round, like the full moon. Idomeneus[456] rose to his feet upright and spoke his word out to the Argives:[457] “Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:[458] am I the only one who can see the horses, or can you[459] also? It seems to me there are other horses leading[460] and I make out another charioteer. The mares of Eumelos[461] must have come to grief somewhere in the plain, who led on the way out,[462] for those I saw running out in front as they made the turn-post[463] I can see no longer anywhere, though I watch and though my eyes[464] look everywhere about the plain of Troy. But it must be[465] that the reins got away from the charioteer, or he could not hold them[466] well in hand at the goal and failed to double the turn-post.[467] There I think he must have been thrown out and his chariot broken,[468] and the mares bolted away with the wildness upon their spirit.[469] But you also stand up and look for yourselves; I cannot[470] well make out, but it seems to me the man who is leading[471] is an Aitolian by birth, but lord of the Argives,[472] the son of Tydeus, breaker of horses, strong Diomedes.”[473] Swift Aias, son of Oïleus, spoke shamefully to him in anger:[474] “Idomeneus, what was all this windy talk? The light-footed[475] horses are still far where they sweep over the great plain.[476] You are not by so much the youngest among the Argives,[477] nor do the eyes in your head see so much sharper than others.[478] But forever you are windy with your words, and you should not[479] be a windy speaker. There are others here better than you are.[480] The horses who are in front are the same as before, and they are[481] those of Eumelos, and he stands holding the reins behind them.”[482] The lord of the Kretans answered him to his face in anger:[483] “Aias, surpassing in abuse, yet stupid, in all else[484] you are worst of the Argives with that stubborn mind of yours. Come then,[485] let us put up a wager of a tripod or cauldron[486] and make Agamemnon, son of Atreus, witness between us[487] as to which horses lead. And when you pay, you will find out.”[488] So he spoke, and swift Aias, son of Oïleus, was rising[489] up, angry in turn, to trade hard words with him. And now[490] the quarrel between the two of them would have gone still further,[491] had not Achilleus himself risen up and spoken between them:[492] “No longer now, Aias and Idomeneus, continue[493] to exchange this bitter and evil talk. It is not becoming.[494] If another acted so, you yourselves would be angry.  p 283  [495] Rather sit down again among those assembled and watch for[496] the horses, and they in their strain for victory will before long[497] be here. Then you each can see for himself, and learn which[498] of the Argives’ horses have run first and which have run second.”[499] He spoke, and now Tydeus’ son in his rapid course was close on them[500] and he lashed them always with the whipstroke from the shoulder. His horses[501] still lifted their feet light and high as they made their swift passage.[502] Dust flying splashed always the charioteer, and the chariot[503] that was overlaid with gold and tin still rolled hard after[504] the flying feet of the horses, and in their wake there was not much[505] trace from the running rims of the wheels left in the thin dust.[506] The horses came in running hard. Diomedes stopped them[507] in the middle of where the men were assembled, with the dense sweat starting[508] and dripping to the ground from neck and chest of his horses.[509] He himself vaulted down to the ground from his shining chariot[510] and leaned his whip against the yoke. Nor did strong Sthenelos[511] delay, but made haste to take up the prizes, and gave the woman[512] to his high-hearted companions to lead away and the tripod[513] with ears to carry, while Diomedes set free the horses.[514] After him Neleian Antilochos drove in his horses,[515] having passed Menelaos, not by speed but by taking advantage.[516] But even so Menelaos held his fast horses close on him.[517] As far as from the wheel stands the horse who is straining[518] to pull his master with the chariot over the flat land;[519] the extreme hairs in the tail of the horse brush against the running[520] rim of the wheel, and he courses very close, there is not much[521] space between as he runs a great way over the flat land;[522] by so much Menelaos was left behind by Antilochos[523] the blameless. At first he was left behind the length of a discus[524] thrown, but was overhauling him fast, with Aithe[525] of the fair mane, Agamemnon’s mare, putting on a strong burst.[526] If both of them had had to run the course any further,[527] Menelaos would have passed him, and there could have been no argument.[528] But Meriones, strong henchman of Idomeneus, was left[529] a spearcast’s length behind by glorious Menelaos.[530] For his horses with splendid manes were slowest of all, and likewise[531] he himself was of least account for the racing of chariots.[532] Last and behind them all came in the son of Admetos[533] dragging his fine chariot and driving his horses before him,[534] and seeing this, brilliant swift-footed Achilleus took pity upon him[535] and stood forth among the Argives and spoke to them all in winged words:[536] “The best man is driving his single-foot horses in last.[537] Come then, we must give some kind of prize, and well he deserves it;[538] second prize; let first place go to the son of Tydeus.”[539] So he spoke, and all gave approval to what he was urging,[540] and he would have given the horse, since all the Achaians[541] approved, had not Antilochos, son of great-hearted Nestor,[542] stood up to answer Peleïd Achilleus, and argue:[543] “Achilleus, I shall be very angry with you if you accomplish[544] what you have said. You mean to take my prize away from me,  p 284  [545] with the thought in mind that his chariot fouled and his running horses[546] but he himself is great. He should have prayed to the immortal[547] gods. That is why he came in last of all in the running.[548] But if you are sorry for him and he is dear to your liking,[549] there is abundant gold in your shelter, and there is bronze there[550] and animals, and there are handmaidens and single-foot horses.[551] You can take from these, and give him afterwards a prize still greater[552] than mine, or now at once, and have the Achaians applaud you.[553] But the mare I will not give up, and the man who wants her[554] must fight me for her with his hands before he can take her.”[555] So he spoke, but brilliant swift-footed Achilleus, favouring[556] Antilochos, smiled, since he was his beloved companion,[557] and answered him and addressed him in winged words: “Antilochos,[558] if you would have me bring some other thing out of my dwelling[559] as special gift for Eumelos, then for your sake I will do it.[560] I will give him that corselet I stripped from Asteropaios;[561] it is bronze, but there is an overlay circled about it[562] in shining tin. It will be a gift that will mean much to him.”[563] He spoke, and told Automedon, his beloved companion,[564] to bring it out of the shelter, and he went away, and brought it back,[565] and put it in Eumelos’ hands. And he accepted it joyfully.[566] But now Menelaos, heart full of bitterness, stood up among them[567] in relentless anger against Antilochos, and the herald[568] put the staff into his hand and gave the call for the Argives[569] to be silent. And he stood forth, a man like a god, and spoke to them:[570] “Antilochos, you had good sense once. See what you have done.[571] You have defiled my horsemanship, you have fouled my horses[572] by throwing your horses in their way, though yours were far slower.[573] Come then, o leaders of the Argives and their men of counsel:[574] judge between the two of us now; and without favour;[575] so that no man of the bronze-armoured Achaians shall say of us:[576] ‘Menelaos using lies and force against Antilochos[577] went off with the mare he won, for his horses were far slower[578] but he himself was greater in power and degree.’ Or rather[579] come, I myself will give the judgment, and I think no other[580] man of the Danaans can call it in question, for it will be right.[581] Antilochos, beloved of Zeus, come here. This is justice.[582] Stand in front of your horses and chariot, and in your hand take[583] up the narrow whip with which you drove them before, then[584] lay your hand on the horses and swear by him who encircles[585] the earth and shakes it you used no guile to baffle my chariot.”[586] Then in turn Antilochos of the good counsel answered him:[587] “Enough now. For I, my lord Menelaos, am younger[588] by far than you, and you are the greater and go before me.[589] You know how greedy transgressions flower in a young man, seeing[590] that his mind is the more active but his judgment is lightweight. Therefore[591] I would have your heart be patient with me. I myself will give you[592] the mare I won, and if there were something still greater you asked for[593] out of my house, I should still be willing at once to give it[594] to you, beloved of Zeus, rather than all my days[595] fall from your favour and be in the wrong before the divinities.”[596] He spoke, the son of Nestor the great-hearted, and leading  p 285  [597] the mare up gave her to Menelaos’ hands. But his anger[598] was softened, as with dew the ears of corn are softened[599] in the standing corn growth of a shuddering field. For you also[600] the heart, o Menelaos, was thus softened within you.[601] He spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words: “Antilochos,[602] I myself, who was angry, now will give way before you,[603] since you were not formerly loose-minded or vain. It is only[604] that this time your youth got the better of your intelligence.[605] Beware another time of playing tricks on your betters.[606] Any other man of the Achaians might not have appeased me.[607] But you have suffered much for me, and done much hard work,[608] and your noble father, too, and your brother for my sake. Therefore[609] I will be ruled by your supplication, I will even give you[610] the mare, though she is mine, so that these men too may be witnesses[611] that the heart is never arrogant nor stubborn within me.”[612] He spoke, and gave Antilochos’ companion, Noëmon,[613] the mare to lead away, and himself took the glittering cauldron.[614] Fourth, in the order he had driven, Meriones took up[615] the two talents’ weight of gold. But the fifth prize, the two-handled[616] jar, was left. Achilleus carried it through the assembly[617] of the Argives, and give it to Nestor, and stood by and spoke to him:[618] “This, aged sir, is yours to lay away as a treasure[619] in memory of the burial of Patroklos; since never[620] again will you see him among the Argives. I give you this prize[621] for the giving; since never again will you fight with your fists nor wrestle,[622] nor enter again the field for the spear-throwing, nor race[623] on your feet; since now the hardship of old age is upon you.”[624] He spoke, and put it in the hands of Nestor, who took it[625] joyfully and spoke in answer and addressed him in winged words:[626] “Yes, child: all this you said to me was true as you said it.[627] My limbs are no longer steady, dear friend; not my feet, neither[628] do my arms, as once they did, swing light from my shoulders.[629] I wish I were young again and the strength still unshaken within me[630] as once, when great Amaryngkeus was buried by the Epeians[631] at Bouprasion, and his sons gave games for a king’s funeral.[632] There there was no man like me, not among the Epeians[633] nor yet of the Pylians themselves or great-hearted Aitolians.[634] At boxing I won against Klytomedes, the son of Enops,[635] at wrestling against Angkaios of Pleuron, who stood up against me.[636] In the foot-race, for all his speed, I outran Iphiklos,[637] and with the spear I out-threw Polydoros and Phyleus.[638] It was only in the chariot-race that the sons of Aktor[639] defeated me, crossing me in the crowd, so intent on winning[640] were they, for the biggest prizes had been left for the horse-race.[641] Now these sons of Aktor were twins; one held the reins at his leisure,[642] held the reins at his leisure while the other lashed on the horses.[643] This was I, once. Now it is for the young men to encounter[644] in such actions, and for me to give way to the persuasion[645] of gloomy old age. But once I shone among the young heroes.[646] Go now, and honour the death of your companion with contents.[647] I accept this from you gratefully, and my heart is happy[648] that you have remembered me and my kindness, that I am not forgotten  p 286  [649] for the honour that should be my honour among the Achaians.[650] May the gods, for what you have done for me, give you great happiness.”[651] He spoke, and Peleïdes went back among the great numbers[652] of Achaians assembled, when he had listened to all the praise spoken[653] by Neleus’ son, and set forth the prizes for the painful boxing.[654] He led out into the field and tethered there a hard-working[655] six-year-old unbroken jenny, the kind that is hardest[656] to break; and for the loser set out a two-handled goblet.[657] He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:[658] “Son of Atreus, and all you other strong-greaved Achaians,[659] we invite two men, the best among you, to contend for these prizes[660] with their hands up for the blows of boxing. He whom Apollo[661] grants to outlast the other, and all the Achaians witness it,[662] let him lead away the hard-working jenny to his own shelter.[663] The beaten man shall take away the two-handled goblet.”[664] He spoke, and a man huge and powerful, well skilled in boxing,[665] rose up among them; the son of Panopeus, Epeios.[666] He laid his hand on the hard-working jenny, and spoke out:[667] “Let the man come up who will carry off the two-handled goblet.[668] I say no other of the Achaians will beat me at boxing[669] and lead off the jenny. I claim I am the champion. Is it not[670] enough that I fall short in the battle? Since it could not be[671] ever, that a man could be a master in every endeavour.[672] For I tell you this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished.[673] I will smash his skin apart and break his bones on each other.[674] Let those who care for him wait nearby in a huddle about him[675] to carry him out, after my fists have beaten him under.”[676] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.[677] Alone Euryalos stood up to face him, a godlike[678] man, son of lord Mekisteus of the seed of Talaos;[679] of him who came once to Thebes and the tomb of Oidipous after[680] his downfall, and there in boxing defeated all the Kadmeians.[681] The spear-famed son of Tydeus was his second, and talked to him[682] in encouragement, and much desired the victory for him.[683] First he pulled on the boxing belt about his waist, and then[684] gave him the thongs carefully cut from the hide of a ranging[685] ox. The two men, girt up, strode into the midst of the circle[686] and faced each other, and put up their ponderous hands at the same time[687] and closed, so that their heavy arms were crossing each other,[688] and there was a fierce grinding of teeth, the sweat began to run[689] everywhere from their bodies. Great Epeios came in, and hit him[690] as he peered out from his guard, on the cheek, and he could no longer[691] keep his feet, but where he stood the glorious limbs gave.[692] As in the water roughened by the north wind a fish jumps[693] in the weeds of the beach-break, then the dark water closes above him,[694] so Euryalos left the ground from the blow, but great-hearted Epeios[695] took him in his arms and set him upright, and his true companions[696] stood about him, and led him out of the circle, feet dragging[697] as he spat up the thick blood and rolled his head over on one side.[698] He was dizzy when they brought him back and set him among them.[699] But they themselves went and carried off the two-handled goblet.[700] Now Peleïdes set forth the prizes for the third contest,  p 287  [701] for the painful wrestling, at once, and displayed them before the Danaans.[702] There was a great tripod, to set over fire, for the winner.[703] The Achaians among themselves valued it at the worth of twelve oxen.[704] But for the beaten man he set in their midst a woman[705] skilled in much work of her hands, and they rated her at four oxen.[706] He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:[707] “Rise up, two who would endeavour this prize.” So he spoke[708] and presently there rose up huge Telamonian Aias,[709] and resourceful Odysseus rose, who was versed in every advantage.[710] The two men, girt up, strode out into the midst of the circle,[711] and grappled each other in the hook of their heavy arms, as when[712] rafters lock, when a renowned architect has fitted them[713] in the roof of as high house to keep out the force of the winds’ spite.[714] Their backs creaked under stress of violent hands that tugged them[715] stubbornly, and the running sweat broke out, and raw places[716] frequent all along their ribs and their shoulders broke out[717] bright red with blood, as both of them kept up their hard efforts[718] for success and the prize of the wrought tripod. Neither Odysseus[719] was able to bring Aias down or throw him to the ground, nor[720] could Aias, but the great strength of Odysseus held out against him.[721] But now as they made the strong-greaved Achaians begin to be restless,[722] at last great Telamonian Aias said to the other:[723] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:[724] lift me, or I will lift you. All success shall be as Zeus gives it.”[725] He spoke, and heaved; but not forgetting his craft Odysseus[726] caught him with a stroke behind the hollow of the knee, and unnerved[727] the tendons, and threw him over backward, so that Odysseus[728] fell on his chest as the people gazed upon them and wondered.[729] Next, brilliant much-enduring Odysseus endeavoured to lift him[730] and budged him a little from the ground, but still could not raise him[731] clear, then hooked a knee behind, so that both of them went down[732] together to the ground, and lay close, and were soiled in the dust. Then[733] they would have sprung to their feet once more and wrestled a third fall,[734] had not Achilleus himself stood up and spoken to stop them:[735] “Wrestle no more now; do not wear yourselves out and get hurt.[736] You have both won. Therefore take the prizes in equal division[737] and retire, so the rest of the Achaians can have their contests.”[738] So he spoke, and they listened close to him and obeyed him[739] and wiped the dust away from their bodies, and put on their tunics.[740] At once the son of Peleus set out prizes for the foot-race:[741] a mixing-bowl of silver, a work of art, which held only[742] six measures, but for its loveliness it surpassed all others[743] on earth by far, since skilled Sidonian craftsmen had wrought it[744] well, and Phoenicians carried it over the misty face of the water[745] and set it in the harbour, and gave it for a present to Thoas.[746] Euneos, son of Jason, gave it to the hero Patroklos[747] to buy Lykaon, Priam’s son, out of slavery, and now[748] Achilleus made it a prize in memory of his companion,[749] for that man who should prove in the speed of his feet to run lightest.[750] For second place he set out a great ox with fat deep upon him.[751] and for the last runner half a talent’s weight of gold. He stood[752] upright then and spoke his word out among the Argives:  p 288  [753] “Rise up, you who would endeavour this prize.” So he spoke[754] and presently there rose up swift Aias, the son of Oïleus,[755] and Odysseus the resourceful rose up, and after him Nestor’s[756] son, Antilochos, the best runner among all the young men.[757] They stood in line for the start, and Achilleus showed them the turn-post.[758] The field was strung out from the scratch, and not long afterwards[759] Oïleus’ son was out in front, but brilliant Odysseus[760] overhauled him close, as near as to the breast of a woman[761] fair-girdled is the rod she pulls in her hands carefully[762] as she draws the spool out and along the warp, and holds it[763] close to her chest. So Odysseus ran close up, but behind him,[764] and his feet were hitting the other’s tracks before the dust settled.[765] Great Odysseus was breathing on the back of the head of Aias[766] as he ran and held his speed, and all the Achaians were shouting[767] for his effort to win, and hallooed him hard along in his running.[768] But as they were running the last part of the race, then Odysseus[769] said a prayer inside his own mind to grey-eyed Athene:[770] “Hear me, goddess; be kind; and come with strength for my footsteps.”[771] So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.[772] She made his limbs light, both his feet and the hands above them.[773] Now as they were for making their final sprint for the trophy.[774] there Aias slipped in his running, for Athene unbalanced him,[775] where dung was scattered on the ground from the bellowing oxen slaughtered[776] by swift-footed Achilleus, those he slew to honour Patroklos;[777] and his mouth and nose were filled with the cow dung, so that Odysseus[778] the great and much enduring took off the mixing-bowl, seeing[779] he had passed him and come in first, and the ox went to glorious Aias.[780] He stood there holding in his hands the horn of the field-ox,[781] spitting the dung from his mouth, and spoke his word to the Argives:[782] “Ah, now! That goddess made me slip on my feet, who has always[783] stood over Odysseus like a mother, and taken good care of him.”[784] He spoke, and all the rest of them laughed happily at him.[785] In turn Antilochos took up prize for last place, and carried it[786] off, and grinning spoke his word out among the Argives:[787] “Friends, you all know well what I tell you, that still the immortals[788] continue to favour the elder men. For see now, Aias[789] is elder than I, if only by a little, but this man[790] is out of another age than ours and one of the ancients.[791] But his, they say, is a green old age. It would be a hard thing[792] for any Achaian to match his speed. Except for Achilleus.”[793] So he spoke, and glorified the swift-footed Peleion.[794] And Achilleus gave him an answer for what he said, and spoke to him:[795] “Antilochos, your good word for me shall not have been spoken[796] in vain. I shall give you another half-talent of gold in addition.”[797] He spoke, and put it in Antilochos’ hands, who received it joyfully.[798] Then the son of Peleus carried into the circle and set down[799] a far-shadowing spear, and set down beside it a shield and a helmet:[800] the armour of Sarpedon, that Patroklos stripped from his body.[801] He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:[802] “We invite two men, the best among you, to contend for these prizes.  p 289  [803] Let them draw their armour upon them and take up the rending bronze spears[804] and stand up to each other in the trial of close combat. The fighter[805] who is first of the two to get in a stroke at the other’s fair body,[806] to get through armour and dark blood and reach to the vitals,[807] to that man I will give this magnificent silver-nailed[808] sword of Thrace I stripped from the body of Asteropaios.[809] But let both men carry off this armour and have it in common;[810] and we shall set out a brave dinner before them both in our shelters.”[811] So he spoke, and there rose up huge Telamonian Aias,[812] and next the son of Tydeus rose up, strong Diomedes.[813] When these were in their armour on either side of the assembly,[814] they came together in the middle space, furious for the combat,[815] with dangerous looks, and wonder settled on all the Achaians.[816] Then as, moving forward, the two were closing in on each other,[817] there were three charges, three times they swept in close. Then Aias[818] stabbed at Diomedes’ shield on its perfect circle[819] but did not get through to the skin, for the corselet inside it guarded him.[820] The son of Tydeus, over the top of the huge shield, was always[821] menacing the neck of Aias with the point of the shining[822] spear, but when the Achaians saw it in fear for Aias[823] they called for them to stop and divide the prizes evenly.[824] But the hero Achilleus carried the great sword, with its scabbard[825] and carefully cut sword belt, and gave it to Diomedes.[826] Now the son of Peleus set in place a lump of pig-iron,[827] which had once been the throwing-weight of Eëtion in his great strength;[828] but now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus had slain him and taken[829] the weight away in the ships along with the other possessions.[830] He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:[831] “Rise up, you who would endeavour to win this prize also.[832] For although the rich demesnes of him who wins it lie far off[833] indeed, yet for the succession of five years he will have it[834] to use; for his shepherd for want of iron will not have to go in[835] to the city for it, nor his ploughman either. This will supply them.”[836] So he spoke, and up stood Polypoites the stubborn in battle,[837] and Leonteus in his great strength, a godlike man, and there rose up[838] Aias, the son of Telamon, and brilliant Epeios.[839] They stood in order to throw, and great Epeios took up the weight[840] and whirled and threw it, and all the Achaians laughed when they saw him.[841] Second to throw in turn was Leonteus, scion of Ares,[842] and third in turn huge Telamonian Aias threw it[843] from his ponderous hand, and overpassed the marks of all others.[844] But when Polypoites stubborn in battle caught up the iron,[845] he overthrew the entire field by as far as an ox-herd[846] can cast with his throwing stick which spins through the air and comes down[847] where the cattle graze in their herds, and all the Achaians applauded,[848] and the companions of powerful Polypoites uprising[849] carried the prize of the king away to the hollow vessels.[850] But Achilleus set gloomy iron forth once more, for the archers.[851] He set ten double-bladed axes forth, ten with single  p 290  [852] blades, and planted far away on the sands the mast pole[853] of a dark-prowed ship, and tethered a tremulous wild pigeon to it[854] by a thin string attached to her foot, then challenged the archers[855] to shoot at her: “Now let the man who hits the wild pigeon[856] take up and carry away home with him all the full axes.[857] But if one should miss the bird and still hit the string, that man,[858] seeing that he is the loser, still shall have the half-axes.”[859] So he spoke, and there rose up in his strength the lord Teukros,[860] and Meriones rose up, Idomeneus’ powerful henchman.[861] They chose their lots, and shook them up in a brazen helmet,[862] and Teukros was allotted first place to shoot. He let fly[863] a strong-shot arrow, but did not promise the lord of archery[864] that he would accomplish for him a grand sacrifice of lambs first born.[865] He missed the bird, for Apollo begrudged him that, but he did hit[866] the string beside the foot where the bird was tied, and the tearing[867] arrow went straight through and cut the string, and the pigeon[868] soared swift up toward the sky, while the string dropped and dangled[869] toward the ground. But still the Achaians thundered approval.[870] Meriones in a fury of haste caught the bow from his hand,[871] but had had out an arrow before, while Teukros was aiming,[872] and forthwith promised to the one who strikes from afar, Apollo,[873] that he would accomplish for him a grand sacrifice of lambs first born.[874] Way up under the clouds he saw the tremulous wild dove[875] and as she circled struck her under the wing in the body[876] and the shaft passed clean through and out of her, so that it dropped back[877] and stuck in the ground beside the foot of Meriones, but the bird[878] dropped and fell on top of the mast of the dark-prowed vessel[879] and drooped her neck and the beating wings went slack, and the spirit[880] of life fled swift away from her limbs. Far down from the mast peak[881] she dropped to earth. And the people gazed upon it and wondered.[882] Then Meriones gathered up all ten double axes,[883] but Teukros carried the half-axes back to the hollow ships.[884] Then the son of Peleus carried into the circle and set down[885] a far-shadowing spear and an unfired cauldron with patterns[886] of flowers on it, the worth of an ox. And the spear-throwers rose up.[887] The son of Atreus rose, wide-powerful Agamemnon,[888] and Meriones rose up, Idomeneus’ powerful henchman.[889] But now among them spoke swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:[890] “Son of Atreus, for we know how much you surpass all others,[891] by how much you are greatest for strength among the spear-throwers,[892] therefore take this prize and keep it and go back to your hollow[893] ships; but let us give the spear to the hero Meriones;[894] if your own heart would have it this way, for so I invite you.”[895] He spoke, nor did Agamemnon lord of men disobey him.[896] The hero gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and thereafter[897] handed his prize, surpassingly lovely, to the herald Talthybios.book twenty-four[1] And the games broke up, and the people scattered to go away, each man[2] to his fast-running ship, and the rest of them took thought of their dinner  p 291  [3] and of sweet sleep and its enjoyment; only Achilleus[4] wept still as he remembered his beloved companion, nor did sleep[5] who subdues all come over him, but he tossed from one side to the other[6] in longing for Patroklos, for his manhood and his great strength[7] and all the actions he had seen to the end with him, and the hardships[8] he had suffered; the wars of men; hard crossing of the big waters.[9] Remembering all these things he let fall the swelling tears, lying[10] sometimes along his side, sometimes on his back, and now again[11] prone on his face; then he would stand upright, and pace turning[12] in distraction along the beach of the sea, nor did dawn rising[13] escape him as she brightened across the sea and the beaches.[14] Then, when he had yoked running horses under the chariot[15] he would fasten Hektor behind the chariot, so as to drag him,[16] and draw him three times around the tomb of Menoitios’ fallen[17] son, then rest again in his shelter, and throw down the dead man[18] and leave him to lie sprawled on his face in the dust. But Apollo[19] had pity on him, though he was only a dead man, and guarded[20] the body from all ugliness, and hid all of it under the golden[21] aegis, so that it might not be torn when Achilleus dragged it.[22] So Achilleus in his standing fury outraged great Hektor.[23] The blessed gods as they looked upon him were filled with compassion[24] and kept urging clear-sighted Argeïphontes to steal the body.[25] There this was pleasing to all the others, but never to Hera[26] nor Poseidon, nor the girl of the grey eyes, who kept still[27] their hatred for sacred Ilion as in the beginning,[28] and for Priam and his people, because of the delusion of Paris[29] who insulted the goddesses when they came to him in his courtyard[30] and favoured her who supplied the lust that led to disaster.[31] But now, as it was the twelfth dawn after the death of Hektor,[32] Phoibos Apollo spoke his word out among the immortals:[33] “You are hard, you gods, and destructive. Now did not Hektor[34] burn thigh pieces of oxen and unblemished goats in your honour?[35] Now you cannot bring yourselves to save him, though he is only[36] a corpse, for his wife to look upon, his child and his mother[37] and Priam his father, and his people, who presently thereafter[38] would burn his body in the fire and give him his rites of burial.[39] No, you gods; your desire is to help this cursed Achilleus[40] within whose breast there are no feelings of justice, nor can[41] his mind be bent, but his purposes are fierce, like a lion[42] who when he has given way to his own great strength and his haughty[43] spirit, goes among the flocks of men, to devour them.[44] So Achilleus has destroyed pity, and there is not in him[45] any shame; which does much harm to men but profits them also.[46] For a man must some day lose one who was even closer[47] than this; a brother from the same womb, or a son. And yet[48] he weeps for him, and sorrows for him, and then it is over,[49] for the Destinies put in mortal men the heart of endurance.[50] But this man, now he has torn the heart of life from great Hektor,[51] ties him to his horses and drags him around his beloved companion’s[52] tomb; and nothing is gained thereby for his good, or his honour.[53] Great as he is, let him take care not to make us angry;[54] for see, he does dishonour to the dumb earth in his fury.”  p 292  [55] Then bitterly Hera of the white arms answered him, saying:[56] “What you have said could be true, lord of the silver bow, only[57] if you give Hektor such pride of place as you give to Achilleus.[58] But Hektor was mortal, and suckled at the breast of a woman,[59] while Achilleus is the child of a goddess, one whom I myself[60] nourished and brought up and gave her as bride to her husband[61] Peleus, one dear to the hearts of the immortals, for you all[62] went, you gods, to the wedding; and you too feasted among them[63] and held your lyre, o friend of the evil, faithless forever.”[64] In turn Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to her in answer:[65] “Hera, be not utterly angry with the gods, for there shall not[66] be the same pride of place given both. Yet Hektor also[67] was loved by the gods, best of all the mortals in Ilion.[68] I loved him too. He never failed of gifts to my liking.[69] Never yet has my altar gone without fair sacrifice,[70] the smoke and the savour of it, since that is our portion of honour.[71] The stealing of him we will dismiss, for it is not possible[72] to take bold Hektor secretly from Achilleus, since always[73] his mother is near him night and day; but it would be better[74] if one of the gods would summon Thetis here to my presence[75] so that I can say a close word to her, and see that Achilleus[76] is given gifts by Priam and gives back the body of Hektor.”[77] He spoke, and Iris storm-footed sprang away with the message,[78] and at a point between Samos and Imbros of the high cliffs[79] plunged in the dark water, and the sea crashed moaning about her.[80] She plummeted to the sea floor like a lead weight which, mounted[81] along the horn of an ox who ranges the fields, goes downward[82] and takes death with it to the raw-ravening fish. She found Thetis[83] inside the hollow of her cave, and gathered about her[84] sat the rest of the sea goddesses, and she in their midst[85] was mourning the death of her blameless son, who so soon was destined[86] to die in Troy of the rich soil, far from the land of his fathers.[87] Iris the swift-foot came close beside her and spoke to her:[88] “Rise, Thetis. Zeus whose purposes are infinite calls you.”[89] In turn Thetis the goddess, the silver-footed, answered her:[90] “What does he, the great god, want with me? I feel shamefast[91] to mingle with the immortals, and my heart is confused with sorrows.[92] But I will go. No word shall be in vain, if he says it.”[93] So she spoke, and shining among the divinities took up[94] her black veil, and there is no darker garment. She went[95] on her way, and in front of her rapid wind-footed Iris[96] guided her, and the wave of the water opened about them.[97] They stepped out on the dry land and swept to the sky. There they found[98] the son of Kronos of the wide brows, and gathered about him[99] sat all the rest of the gods, the blessed, who live forever.[100] She sat down beside Zeus father, and Athene made a place for her.[101] Hera put into her hand a beautiful golden goblet[102] and spoke to her to comfort her, and Thetis accepting drank from it.[103] The father of gods and men began the discourse among them:[104] “You have come to Olympos, divine Thetis, for all your sorrow,[105] with an unforgotten grief in your heart. I myself know this.[106] But even so I will tell you why I summoned you hither.  p 293  [107] For nine days there has risen a quarrel among the immortals[108] over the body of Hektor, and Achilleus, stormer of cities.[109] They keep urging clear-sighted Argeïphontes to steal the body,[110] but I still put upon Achilleus the honour that he has, guarding[111] your reverence and your love for me into time afterwards. Go then[112] in all speed to the encampment and give to your son this message:[113] tell him that the gods frown upon him, that beyond all other[114] immortals I myself am angered that in his heart’s madness[115] he holds Hektor beside the curved ships and did not give him[116] back. Perhaps in fear of me he will give back Hektor.[117] Then I will send Iris to Priam of the great heart, with an order[118] to ransom his dear son, going down to the ships of the Achaians[119] and bringing gifts to Achilleus which might soften his anger.”[120] He spoke and the goddess silver-foot Thetis did not disobey him[121] but descended in a flash of speed from the peaks of Olympos[122] and made her way to the shelter of her son, and there found him[123] in close lamentation, and his beloved companions about him[124] were busy at their work and made ready the morning meal, and there[125] stood a great fleecy sheep being sacrificed in the shelter.[126] His honoured mother came close to him and sat down beside him,[127] and stroked him with her hand and called him by name and spoke to him:[128] “My child, how long will you go on eating your heart out in sorrow[129] and lamentation, and remember neither your food nor going[130] to bed? It is a good thing even to lie with a woman[131] in love. For you will not be with me long, but already[132] death and powerful destiny stand closely above you.[133] But listen hard to me, for I come from Zeus with a message.[134] He says that the gods frown upon you, that beyond all other[135] immortals he himself is angered that in your heart’s madness[136] you hold Hektor beside the curved ships and did not redeem him.[137] Come, then, give him up and accept ransom for the body.”[138] Then in turn Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:[139] “So be it. He can bring the ransom and take off the body,[140] if the Olympian himself so urgently bids it.”[141] So, where the ships were drawn together, the son and his mother[142] conversed at long length in winged words. But the son of Kronos[143] stirred Iris to go down to sacred Ilion, saying:[144] “Go forth, Iris the swift, leaving your place for Olympos,[145] and go to Priam of the great heart within Ilion, tell him[146] to ransom his dear son, going down to the ships of the Achaians[147] and bringing gifts to Achilleus which might soften his anger:[148] alone, let no other man of the Trojans go with him, but only[149] let one elder herald attend him, one who can manage[150] the mules and the easily running wagon, so he can carry[151] the dead man, whom great Achilleus slew, back to the city.[152] Let death not be a thought in his heart, let him have no fear;[153] such an escort shall I send to guide him, Argeïphontes[154] who shall lead him until he brings him to Achilleus. And after[155] he has brought him inside the shelter of Achilleus, neither[156] will the man himself kill him, but will hold back all the others,[157] for he is no witless man nor unwatchful, nor is he wicked,[158] but will in all kindness spare one who comes to him as a suppliant.”  p 294  [159] He spoke, and storm-footed Iris swept away with the message[160] and came to the house of Priam. There she found outcry and mourning.[161] The sons sitting around their father inside the courtyard[162] made their clothes sodden with their tears, and among them the old man[163] sat veiled, beaten into his mantle. Dung lay thick[164] on the head and neck of the aged man, for he had been rolling[165] in it, he had gathered and smeared it on with his hands. And his daughters[166] all up and down the house and the wives of his sons were mourning[167] as they remembered all those men in their numbers and valour[168] who lay dead, their lives perished at the hands of the Argives.[169] The messenger of Zeus stood beside Priam and spoke to him[170] in a small voice, and yet the shivers took hold of his body:[171] “Take heart, Priam, son of Dardanos, do not be frightened.[172] I come to you not eyeing you with evil intention[173] but with the purpose of good toward you. I am a messenger[174] of Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.[175] The Olympian orders you to ransom Hektor the brilliant,[176] to bring gifts to Achilleus which may soften his anger:[177] alone, let no other man of the Trojans go with you, but only[178] let one elder herald attend you, one who can manage[179] the mules and the easily running wagon, so he can carry[180] the dead man, whom great Achilleus slew, back to the city.[181] Let death not be a thought in your heart, you need have no fear,[182] such an escort shall go with you to guide you, Argeïphontes[183] who will lead you till he brings you to Achilleus. And after[184] he has brought you inside the shelter of Achilleus, neither[185] will the man himself kill you but will hold back all the others;[186] for he is no witless man nor unwatchful, nor is he wicked[187] but will in all kindness spare one who comes to him as a suppliant.”[188] So Iris the swift-footed spoke and went away from him.[189] Thereupon he ordered his sons to make ready the easily rolling[190] mule wagon, and to fasten upon it the carrying basket.[191] He himself went into the storeroom, which was fragrant[192] and of cedar, and high-ceilinged, with many bright treasures inside it.[193] He called out to Hekabe his wife, and said to her:[194] “Dear wife, a messenger came to me from Zeus on Olympos,[195] that I must go to the ships of the Achaians and ransom my dear son,[196] bringing gifts to Achilleus which may soften his anger.[197] Come then, tell me. What does it seem best to your own mind[198] for me to do? My heart, my strength are terribly urgent[199] that I go there to the ships within the wide army of the Achaians.”[200] So he spoke, and his wife cried out loud, and answered him:[201] “Ah me, where has that wisdom gone for which you were famous[202] in time before, among outlanders and those you rule over?[203] How can you wish to go alone to the ships of the Achaians[204] before the eyes of a man who has slaughtered in such numbers[205] such brave sons of yours? The heart in you is iron. For if[206] he has you within his grasp and lays eyes upon you, that man[207] who is savage and not to be trusted will not take pity upon you[208] nor have the respect for your rights. Let us sit apart in our palace[209] now, and weep for Hektor, and the way at the first strong Destiny[210] spun with his life line when he was born, when I gave birth to him,  p 295  [211] that the dogs with their shifting feet should feed on him, far from his parents,[212] gone down before a stronger man; I wish I could set teeth[213] in the middle of his liver and eat it. That would be vengeance[214] for what he did to my son; for he slew him when he was no coward[215] but standing before the men of Troy and the deep-girdled women[216] of Troy, with no thought in his mind of flight or withdrawal.”[217] In turn the aged Priam, the godlike, answered her saying:[218] “Do not hold me back when I would be going, neither yourself be[219] a bird of bad omen in my palace. You will not persuade me.[220] If it had been some other who ordered me, one of the mortals,[221] one of those who are soothsayers, or priests, or diviners,[222] I might have called it a lie and we might rather have rejected it.[223] But now, for I myself heard the god and looked straight upon her,[224] I am going, and this word shall not be vain. If it is my destiny[225] to die there by the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians,[226] then I wish that. Achilleus can slay me at once, with my own son[227] caught in my arms, once I have my fill of mourning above him.”[228] He spoke, and lifted back the fair covering of his clothes-chest[229] and from inside took out twelve robes surpassingly lovely[230] and twelve mantles to be worn single, as many blankets,[231] as many great white cloaks, also the same number of tunics.[232] He weighed and carried out ten full talents of gold, and brought forth[233] two shining tripods, and four cauldrons, and brought out a goblet[234] of surpassing loveliness that the men of Thrace had given him[235] when he went to them with a message, but now the old man spared not[236] even this in his halls, so much was it his heart’s desire[237] to ransom back his beloved son. But he drove off the Trojans[238] all from his cloister walks, scolding them with words of revilement:[239] “Get out, you failures, you disgraces. Have you not also[240] mourning of your own at home that you come to me with your sorrows?[241] Is it not enough that Zeus, son of Kronos, has given me sorrow[242] in losing the best of my sons? You also shall be aware of this[243] since you will be all the easier for the Achaians to slaughter[244] now he is dead. But, for myself, before my eyes look[245] upon this city as it is destroyed and its people are slaughtered,[246] my wish is to go sooner down to the house of the death god.”[247] He spoke, and went after the men with a stick, and they fled outside[248] before the fury of the old man. He was scolding his children[249] and cursing Helenos, and Paris, Agathon the brilliant,[250] Pammon and Antiphonos, Polites of the great war cry,[251] Deïphobos and Hippothoös and proud Dios. There were nine[252] sons to whom now the old man gave orders and spoke to them roughly:[253] “Make haste, wicked children, my disgraces. I wish all of you[254] had been killed beside the running ships in the place of Hektor.[255] Ah me, for my evil destiny. I have had the noblest[256] of sons in Troy, but I say not one of them is left to me,[257] Mestor like a god and Troilos whose delight was in horses,[258] and Hektor, who was a god among men, for he did not seem like[259] one who was child of a mortal man, but of a god. All these[260] Ares has killed, and all that are left me are the disgraces,[261] the liars and the dancers, champions of the chorus, the plunderers  p 296  [262] of their own people in their land of lambs and kids. Well then,[263] will you not get my wagon ready and be quick about it,[264] and put all these things on it, so we can get on with our journey?”[265] So he spoke, and they in terror at the old man’s scolding[266] hauled out the easily running wagon for mules, a fine thing[267] new-fabricated, and fastened the carrying basket upon it.[268] They took away from its peg the mule yoke made of boxwood[269] with its massive knob, well fitted with guiding rings, and brought forth[270] the yoke lashing (together with the yoke itself) of nine cubits[271] and snugged it well into place upon the smooth-polished wagon-pole[272] at the foot of the beam, then slipped the ring over the peg, and lashed it[273] with three turns on either side to the knob, and afterwards[274] fastened it all in order and secured it under a hooked guard.[275] Then they carried out and piled into the smooth-polished mule wagon[276] all the unnumbered spoils to be given for the head of Hektor,[277] then yoked the powerful-footed mules who pulled in the harness[278] and whom the Mysians gave once as glorious presents to Priam;[279] but for Priam they led under the yoke those horses the old man[280] himself had kept, and cared for them at his polished manger.[281] Now in the high house the yoking was done for the herald[282] and Priam, men both with close counsels in their minds. And now came[283] Hekabe with sorrowful heart and stood close beside them[284] carrying in her right hand the kind, sweet wine in a golden[285] goblet, so that before they went they might pour a drink-offering.[286] She stood in front of the horses, called Priam by name and spoke to him:[287] “Here, pour a libation to Zeus father, and pray you may come back[288] home again from those who hate you, since it seems the spirit[289] within you drives you upon the ships, though I would not have it.[290] Make your prayer then to the dark-misted, the sons of Kronos[291] on Ida, who looks out on all the Troad, and ask him[292] for a bird of omen, a rapid messenger, which to his own mind[293] is dearest of all birds and his strength is the biggest, one seen[294] on the right, so that once your eyes have rested upon him[295] you can trust in him and go to the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans.[296] But if Zeus of the wide brows will not grant you his own messenger,[297] then I, for one, would never urge you on nor advise you[298] to go to the Argive ships, for all your passion to do it.”[299] Then in answer to her again spoke Priam the godlike:[300] “My lady, I will not disregard this wherein you urge me.[301] It is well to lift hands to Zeus and ask if he will have mercy.”[302] The old man spoke, and told the housekeeper who attended them[303] to pour unstained water over his hands. She standing beside them[304] and serving them held the washing-bowl in her hands, and a pitcher.[305] He washed his hands and took the cup from his wife. He stood up[306] in the middle of the enclosure, and prayed, and poured the wine out[307] looking up into the sky, and gave utterance and spoke, saying:[308] “Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured:[309] grant that I come to Achilleus for love and pity; but send me[310] a bird of omen, a rapid messenger which to your own mind[311] is dearest of all birds and his strength is biggest, one seen[312] on the right, so that once my eyes have rested upon him[313] I may trust in him and go to the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans.”  p 297  [314] So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels heard him.[315] Straightway he sent down the most lordly of birds, an eagle,[316] the dark one, the marauder, called as well the black eagle.[317] And as big as is the build of the door to a towering chamber[318] in the house of a rich man, strongly fitted with bars, of such size[319] was the spread of his wings on either side. He swept through the city[320] appearing on the right hand, and the people looking upon him[321] were uplifted and the hearts made glad in the breasts of all of them.[322] Now in urgent haste the old man mounted into his chariot[323] and drove out through the forecourt and the thundering close. Before him[324] the mules hauled the wagon on its four wheels, Idaios[325] the sober-minded driving them, and behind him the horses[326] came on as the old man laid the lash upon them and urged them[327] rapidly through the town, and all his kinsmen were following[328] much lamenting, as if he went to his death. When the two men[329] had gone down through the city, and out, and come to the flat land,[330] the rest of them turned back to go to Ilion, the sons[331] and the sons-in-law. And Zeus of the wide brows failed not to notice[332] the two as they showed in the plain. He saw the old man and took pity[333] upon him, and spoke directly to his beloved son, Hermes:[334] “Hermes, for to you beyond all other gods it is dearest[335] to be man’s companion, and you listen to whom you will, go now[336] on your way, and so guide Priam inside the hollow ships[337] of the Achaians, that no man shall see him, none be aware of him,[338] of the other Danaans, till he has come to the son of Peleus.”[339] He spoke, nor disobeyed him the courier, Argeïphontes.[340] Immediately he bound upon his feet the fair sandals[341] golden and immortal, that carried him over the water[342] as over the dry land of the main abreast of the wind’s blast.[343] He caught up the staff, with which he mazes the eyes of those mortals[344] whose eyes he would maze, or wakes again the sleepers. Holding[345] this in his hands, strong Argeïphontes winged his way onward[346] until he came suddenly to Troy and the Hellespont, and there[347] walked on, and there took the likeness of a young man, a noble,[348] with beard new grown, which is the most graceful time of young manhood.[349] Now when the two had driven past the great tomb of Ilos[350] they stayed their mules and horses to water them in the river,[351] for by this time darkness had descended on the land; and the herald[352] made out Hermes, who was coming toward them at a short distance.[353] He lifted his voice and spoke aloud to Priam: “Take thought,[354] son of Dardanos. Here is work for a mind that is careful.[355] I see a man; I think he will presently tear us to pieces.[356] Come then, let us run away with our horses, or if not, then[357] clasp his knees and entreat him to have mercy upon us.”[358] So he spoke, and the old man’s mind was confused, he was badly[359] frightened, and the hairs stood up all over his gnarled body[360] and he stood staring, but the kindly god himself coming closer[361] took the old man’s hand, and spoke to him and asked him a question[362] “Where, my father, are you thus guiding your mules and horses[363] through the immortal night while other mortals are sleeping?[364] Have you no fear of the Achaians whose wind is fury,[365] who hate you, who are your enemies, and are near? For if one  p 298  [366] of these were to see you, how you are conveying so many[367] treasures through the swift black night, what then could you think of?[368] You are not young yourself, and he who attends you is aged[369] for beating off any man who might pick a quarrel with you.[370] But I will do you no harm myself, I will even keep off[371] another who would. You seem to me like a beloved father.”[372] In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:[373] “Yes, in truth, dear child, all this is much as you tell me;[374] yet still there is some god who has held his hand above me,[375] who sent such a wayfarer as you to meet me, an omen[376] of good, for such you are by your form, your admired beauty[377] and the wisdom in your mind. Your parents are fortunate in you.”[378] Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:[379] “Yes, old sir, all this that you said is fair and orderly.[380] But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately.[381] Can it be you convey these treasures in all their numbers and beauty[382] to outland men, so that they can be still kept safe for you?[383] Or are all of you by now abandoning sacred Ilion[384] in fear, such a one was he who died, the best man among you,[385] your son; who was never wanting when you fought against the Achaians.”[386] In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:[387] “But who are you, o best of men, and who are your parents?[388] Since you spoke of my ill-starred son’s death, and with honour.”[389] Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:[390] “You try me out, aged sir. You ask me of glorious Hektor[391] whom many a time my eyes have seen in the fighting where men win[392] glory, as also on the time when he drove back the Argives[393] on their ships and kept killing them with the stroke of the sharp bronze,[394] and we stood by and wondered at him; for then Achilleus[395] would not let us fight by reason of his anger at Agamemnon.[396] For I am Achilleus’ henchman, and the same strong-wrought vessel[397] brought us here; and I am a Myrmidon, and my father[398] is Polyktor; a man of substance, but aged, as you are.[399] He has six sons beside, and I am the seventh, and I shook[400] lots with the others, and it was my lot to come on this venture.[401] But now I have come to the plain away from the ships, for at daybreak[402] the glancing-eyed Achaians will do battle around the city.[403] They chafe from sitting here too long, nor have the Achaians’[404] kings the strength to hold them back as they break for the fighting.”[405] In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:[406] “If then you are henchman to Peleïd Achilleus,[407] come, tell me the entire truth, and whether my son lies[408] still beside the ships, or whether by now he has been hewn[409] limb from limb and thrown before the dogs by Achilleus.”[410] Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:[411] “Aged sir, neither have any dogs eaten him, nor have[412] the birds, but he lies yet beside the ship of Achilleus[413] at the shelters, and as he was; now here is the twelfth dawn[414] he has lain there, nor does his flesh decay, nor do worms feed[415] on him, they who devour men who have fallen in battle.[416] It is true, Achilleus drags him at random around his beloved[417] companion’s tomb, as dawn on dawn appears, yet he cannot  p 299  [418] mutilate him; you yourself can see when you go there[419] how fresh with dew he lies, and the blood is all washed from him,[420] nor is there any corruption, all the wounds have been closed up[421] where he was struck, since many drove the bronze in his body.[422] So it is that the blessed immortals care for your son, though[423] he is nothing but a dead man; because in their hearts they loved him.”[424] He spoke, and the old man was made joyful and answered him, saying:[425] “My child, surely it is good to give the immortals[426] their due gifts; because my own son, if ever I had one,[427] never forgot in his halls the gods who live on Olympos.[428] Therefore they remembered him even in death’s stage. Come, then,[429] accept at my hands this beautiful drinking-cup, and give me[430] protection for my body, and with the gods’ grace be my escort[431] until I make my way to the shelter of the son of Peleus.”[432] In turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:[433] “You try me out, aged sir, for I am young, but you will not[434] persuade me, telling me to accept your gifts when Achilleus[435] does not know. I fear him at heart and have too much reverence[436] to rob him. Such a thing might be to my sorrow hereafter.[437] But I would be your escort and take good care of you, even[438] till I came to glorious Argos in a fast ship or following[439] on foot, and none would fight you because he despised your escort.”[440] The kind god spoke, and sprang up behind the horses and into[441] the chariot, and rapidly caught in his hands the lash and the guide reins,[442] and breathed great strength into the mules and horses. Now after[443] they had got to the fortifications about the ships, and the ditch, there[444] were sentries, who had just begun to make ready their dinner,[445] but about these the courier Argeïphontes drifted[446] sleep, on all, and quickly opened the gate, and shoved back[447] the door-bars, and brought in Priam and the glorious gifts on the wagon.[448] But when they had got to the shelter of Peleus’ son: a towering[449] shelter the Myrmidons had built for their king, hewing[450] the timbers of pine, and they made a roof of thatch above it[451] shaggy with grass that they had gathered out of the meadows;[452] and around it made a great courtyard for their king, with hedgepoles[453] set close together; the gate was secured by a single door-piece[454] of pine, and three Achaians could ram it home in its socket[455] and three could pull back and open the huge door-bar; three other[456] Achaians, that is, but Achilleus all by himself could close it.[457] At this time Hermes, the kind god, opened the gate for the old man[458] and brought in the glorious gifts for Peleus’ son, the swift-footed,[459] and dismounted to the ground from behind the horses, and spoke forth:[460] “Aged sir, I who came to you am a god immortal,[461] Hermes. My father sent me down to guide and go with you.[462] But now I am going back again, and I will not go in[463] before the eyes of Achilleus, for it would make others angry[464] for an immortal god so to face mortal men with favour.[465] But go you in yourself and clasp the knees of Peleion[466] and entreat him in the name of his father, the name of his mother[467] of the lovely hair, and his child, and so move the spirit within him.”[468] So Hermes spoke, and went away to the height of Olympos,[469] but Priam vaulted down to the ground from behind the horses  p 300  [470] and left Idaios where he was, for he stayed behind, holding[471] in hand the horses and mules. The old man made straight for the dwelling[472] where Achilleus the beloved of Zeus was sitting. He found him[473] inside, and his companions were sitting apart, as two only,[474] Automedon the hero and Alkimos, scion of Ares,[475] were busy beside him. He had just now got through with his dinner,[476] with eating and drinking, and the table still stood by. Tall Priam[477] came in unseen by the other men and stood close beside him[478] and caught the knees of Achilleus in his arms, and kissed the hands[479] that were dangerous and manslaughtering and had killed so many[480] of his sons. As when dense disaster closes on one who has murdered[481] a man in his own land, and he comes to the country of others,[482] to a man of substance, and wonder seizes on those who behold him,[483] so Achilleus wondered as he looked on Priam, a godlike[484] man, and the rest of them wondered also, and looked at each other.[485] But now Priam spoke to him in the words of a suppliant:[486] “Achilleus like the gods, remember your father, one who[487] is of years like mine, and on the door-sill of sorrowful old age.[488] And they who dwell nearby encompass him and afflict him,[489] nor is there any to defend him against the wrath, the destruction.[490] Yet surely he, when he hears of you and that you are still living,[491] is gladdened within his heart and all his days he is hopeful[492] that he will see his beloved son come home from the Troad.[493] But for me, my destiny was evil. I have had the noblest[494] of sons in Troy, but I say not one of them is left to me.[495] Fifty were my sons, when the sons of the Achaians came here.[496] Nineteen were born to me from the womb of a single mother,[497] and other women bore the rest in my palace; and of these[498] violent Ares broke the strength in the knees of most of them,[499] but one was left me who guarded my city and people, that one[500] you killed a few days since as he fought in defence of his country,[501] Hektor; for whose sake I come now to the ships of the Achaians[502] to win him back from you, and I bring you gifts beyond number.[503] Honour then the gods, Achilleus, and take pity upon me[504] remembering your father, yet I am still more pitiful;[505] I have gone through what no other mortal on earth has gone through;[506] I put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my children.”[507] So he spoke, and stirred in the other a passion of grieving[508] for his own father. He took the old man’s hand and pushed him[509] gently away, and the two remembered, as Priam sat huddled[510] at the feet of Achilleus and wept close for manslaughtering Hektor[511] and Achilleus wept now for his own father, now again[512] for Patroklos. The sound of their mourning moved in the house. Then[513] when great Achilleus had taken full satisfaction in sorrow[514] and the passion for it had gone from his mind and body, thereafter[515] he rose from his chair, and took the old man by the hand, and set him[516] on his feet again, in pity for the grey head and the grey beard,[517] and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: “Ah, unlucky,[518] surely you have had much evil to endure in your spirit.[519] How could you dare to come alone to the ships of the Achaians[520] and before my eyes, when I am one who have killed in such numbers[521] such brave sons of yours? The heart in you is iron. Come, then,  p 301  [522] and sit down upon this chair, and you and I will even let[523] our sorrows lie still in the heart for all our grieving. There is not[524] any advantage to be won from grim lamentation.[525] Such is the way the gods spun life for unfortunate mortals,[526] that we live in unhappiness, but the gods themselves have no sorrows.[527] There are two urns that on the door-sill of Zeus. They are unlike[528] for the gifts they bestow: an urn of evils, an urn of blessings.[529] If Zeus who delights in thunder mingles these and bestows them[530] on man, he shifts, and moves now in evil, again in good fortune.[531] But when Zeus bestows from the urn of sorrows, he makes a failure[532] of man, and the evil hunger drives him over the shining[533] earth, and he wanders respected neither of gods nor mortals.[534] Such were the shining gifts given by the gods to Peleus[535] from his birth, who outshone all men beside for his riches[536] and pride of possession, and was lord over the Myrmidons. Thereto[537] the gods bestowed an immortal wife on him, who was mortal.[538] But even on him the god piled evil also. There was not[539] any generation of strong sons born to him in his great house[540] but a single all-untimely child he had, and I give him[541] no care as he grows old, since far from the land of my fathers[542] I sit here in Troy, and bring nothing but sorrow to you and your children.[543] And you, old sir, we are told you prospered once; for as much[544] as Lesbos, Makar’s hold, confines to the north above it[545] and Phrygia from the north confines, and enormous Hellespont,[546] of these, old sir, you were lord once in your wealth and your children.[547] But now the Uranian gods brought us, an affliction upon you,[548] forever there is fighting about your city, and men killed.[549] But bear up, nor mourn endlessly in your heart, for there is not[550] anything to be gained from grief for your son; you will never[551] bring him back; sooner you must go through yet another sorrow.”[552] In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:[553] “Do not, beloved of Zeus, make me sit on a chair while Hektor[554] lies yet forlorn among the shelters; rather with all speed[555] give him back, so my eyes may behold him, and accept the ransom[556] we bring you, which is great. You may have joy of it, and go back[557] to the land of your own fathers, since once you have permitted me[558] to go on living myself and continue to look on the sunlight.”[559] Then looking darkly at him spoke swift-footed Achilleus:[560] “No longer stir me up, old sir. I myself am minded[561] to give Hektor back to you. A messenger came to me from Zeus,[562] my mother, she who bore me, the daughter of the sea’s ancient.[563] I know you, Priam, in my heart, and it does not escape me[564] that some god led you to the running ships of the Achaians.[565] For no mortal would dare come to our encampment, not even[566] one strong in youth. He could not get by the pickets, he could not[567] lightly unbar the bolt that secures our gateway. Therefore[568] you must not further make my spirit move in my sorrows,[569] for fear, old sir, I might not let you alone in my shelter,[570] suppliant as you are; and be guilty before the god’s orders.”[571] He spoke, and the old man was frightened and did as he told him.[572] The son of Peleus bounded to the door of the house like a lion,[573] nor went alone, but the two henchmen followed attending,  p 302  [574] the hero Automedon and Alkimos, those whom Achilleus[575] honoured beyond all companions after Patroklos dead. These two[576] now set free from under the yoke the mules and the horses,[577] and led inside the herald, the old king’s crier, and gave him[578] a chair to sit in, then from the smooth-polished mule wagon[579] lifted out the innumerable spoils for the head of Hektor,[580] but left inside it two great cloaks and a finespun tunic[581] to shroud the corpse in when they carried him home. Then Achilleus[582] called out to his serving-maids to wash the body and anoint it[583] all over; but take it first aside, since otherwise Priam[584] might see his son and in the heart’s sorrow not hold in his anger[585] at the sight, and the deep heart in Achilleus be shaken to anger;[586] that he might not kill Priam and be guilty before the god’s orders.[587] Then when the serving-maids had washed the corpse and anointed it[588] with olive oil, they threw a fair great cloak and tunic[589] about him, and Achilleus himself lifted him and laid him[590] on a litter, and his friends helped him lift it to the smooth-polished[591] mule wagon. He groaned then, and called by name on his beloved companion:[592] “Be not angry with me, Patroklos, if you discover,[593] though you be in the house of Hades, that I gave back great Hektor[594] to his loved father, for the ransom he gave me was not unworthy.[595] I will give you your share of the spoils, as much as is fitting.”[596] So spoke great Achilleus and went back into the shelter[597] and sat down on the elaborate couch from which he had risen,[598] against the inward wall, and now spoke his word to Priam:[599] “Your son is given back to you, aged sir, as you asked it.[600] He lies on a bier. When dawn shows you yourself shall see him[601] as you take him away. Now you and I must remember our supper.[602] For even Niobe, she of the lovely tresses, remembered[603] to eat, whose twelve children were destroyed in her palace,[604] six daughters, and six sons in the pride of their youth, whom Apollo[605] killed with arrows from his silver bow, being angered[606] with Niobe, and shaft-showering Artemis killed the daughters;[607] because Niobe likened herself to Leto of the fair colouring[608] and said Leto had borne only two, she herself had borne many;[609] but the two, though they were only two, destroyed all those others.[610] Nine days long they lay in their blood, nor was there anyone[611] to bury them, for the son of Kronos made stones out of[612] the people; but on the tenth day the Uranian gods buried them.[613] But she remembered to eat when she was worn out with weeping.[614] And now somewhere among the rocks, in the lonely mountains,[615] in Sipylos, where they say is the resting place of the goddesses[616] who are nymphs, and dance beside the waters of Acheloios,[617] there, stone still, she broods on the sorrows that the gods gave her.[618] Come then, we also, aged magnificent sir, must remember[619] to eat, and afterwards you may take your beloved son back[620] to Ilion, and mourn for him; and he will be much lamented.”[621] So spoke fleet Achilleus and sprang to his feet and slaughtered[622] a gleaming sheep, and his friends skinned it and butchered it fairly,[623] and cut up the meat expertly into small pieces, and spitted them,[624] and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.  p 303  [625] Automedon took the bread and set it out on the table[626] in fair baskets, while Achilleus served the meats. And thereon[627] they put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[628] But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,[629] Priam, son of Dardanos, gazed upon Achilleus, wondering[630] at his size and beauty, for he seemed like an outright vision[631] of gods. Achilleus in turn gazed on Dardanian Priam[632] and wondered, as he saw his brave looks and listened to him talking.[633] But when they had taken their fill of gazing one on the other,[634] first of the two to speak was the aged man, Priam the godlike:[635] “Give me, beloved of Zeus, a place to sleep presently, so that[636] we may even go to bed and take the pleasure of sweet sleep.[637] For my eyes have not closed underneath my lids since that time[638] when my son lost his life beneath your hands, but always[639] I have been grieving and brooding over my numberless sorrows[640] and wallowed in the muck about my courtyard’s enclosure.[641] Now I have tasted food again and have let the gleaming[642] wine go down my throat. Before, I had tasted nothing.”[643] He spoke, and Achilleus ordered his serving-maids and companions[644] to make a bed in the porch’s shelter and to lay upon it[645] fine underbedding of purple, and spread blankets above it[646] and fleecy robes to be an over-all covering. The maid-servants[647] went forth from the main house, and in their hands held torches,[648] and set to work, and presently had two beds made. Achilleus[649] of the swift feet now looked at Priam and said, sarcastic:[650] “Sleep outside, aged sir and good friend, for fear some Achaian[651] might come in here on a matter of counsel, since they keep coming[652] and sitting by me and making plans; as they are supposed to.[653] But if one of these come through the fleeting black night should notice you[654] he would go straight and tell Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[655] and there would be delay in the ransoming of the body.[656] But come, tell me this and count off for me exactly[657] how many days you intend for the burial of great Hektor.[658] Tell me, so I myself shall stay still and hold back the people.”[659] In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:[660] “If you are willing that we accomplish a complete funeral[661] for great Hektor, this, Achilleus, is what you could do and give[662] me pleasure. For you know surely how we are penned in our city,[663] and wood is far to bring in from the hills, and the Trojans are frightened[664] badly. Nine days we would keep him in our palace and mourn him,[665] and bury him on the tenth day, and the people feast by him,[666] and on the eleventh day we would make the grave-barrow for him,[667] and on the twelfth day fight again; if so we must do.”[668] Then in turn swift-footed brilliant Achilleus answered him:[669] “Then all this, aged Priam, shall be done as you ask it.[670] I will hold off our attack for as much time as you bid me.”[671] So he spoke, and took the aged king by the right hand[672] at the wrist, so that his heart might have no fear. Then these two,[673] Priam and the herald who were both men of close counsel,[674] slept in the place outside the house, in the porch’s shelter;[675] but Achilleus slept in the inward corner of the strong-built shelter,[676] and at his side lay Briseis of the fair colouring.  p 304  [677] Now the rest of the gods and men who were lords of chariots[678] slept nightlong, with the easy bondage of slumber upon them[679] only sleep had not caught Hermes the kind god, who pondered[680] now in his heart the problem of how to escort King Priam[681] from the ships and not be seen by the devoted gate-wardens.[682] He stood above his head and spoke a word to him, saying:[683] “Aged sir, you can have no thought of evil from the way[684] you sleep still among your enemies now Achilleus has left you[685] unharmed. You have ransomed now your dear son and given much for him.[686] But the sons you left behind would give three times as much ransom[687] for you, who are alive, were Atreus’ son Agamemnon[688] to recognize you, and all the other Achaians learn of you.”[689] He spoke, and the old man was afraid, and wakened his herald,[690] and lightly Hermes harnessed for them the mules and the horses[691] and himself drove them through the encampment. And no man knew of them.[692] But when they came to the crossing-place of the fair-running river,[693] of whirling Xanthos, a stream whose father was Zeus the immortal,[694] there Hermes left them and went away to the height of Olympos,[695] and dawn, she of the yellow robe, scattered over all earth,[696] and they drove their horses on to the city with lamentation[697] and clamour, while the mules drew the body. Nor was any other[698] aware of them at the first, no man, no fair-girdled woman,[699] only Kassandra, a girl like Aphrodite the golden,[700] who had gone up to the height of the Pergamos. She saw[701] her dear father standing in the chariot, his herald and crier[702] with him. She saw Hektor drawn by the mules on a litter.[703] She cried out then in sorrow and spoke to the entire city:[704] “Come, men of Troy and Trojan women; look upon Hektor[705] if ever before you were joyful when you saw him come back living[706] from battle; for he was a great joy to his city, and all his people.”[707] She spoke, and there was no man left there in all the city[708] nor woman, but all were held in sorrow passing endurance.[709] They met Priam beside the gates as he brought the dead in.[710] First among them were Hektor’s wife and his honoured mother[711] who tore their hair, and ran up beside the smooth-rolling wagon,[712] and touched his head. And the multitude, wailing, stood there about them.[713] And now and there in front of the gates they would have lamented[714] all day till the sun went down and let fall their tears for Hektor,[715] except that the old man spoke from the chariot to his people:[716] “Give me way to get through with my mules; then afterwards[717] you may sate yourselves with mourning, when I have him inside the palace.”[718] So he spoke, and they stood apart and made way for the wagon.[719] And when they had brought him inside the renowned house, they laid him[720] then on a carved bed, and seated beside him the singers[721] who were to lead the melody in the dirge, and the singers[722] chanted the song of sorrow, and the women were mourning beside them.[723] Andromache of the white arms led the lamentation[724] of the women, and held in her arms the head of manslaughtering Hektor:[725] “My husband, you were lost young from life, and have left me[726] a widow in your house, and the boy is only a baby[727] who was born to you and me, the unhappy. I think he will never  p 305  [728] come of age, for before then head to heel this city[729] will be sacked, for you, its defender, are gone, you who guarded[730] the city, and the grave wives, and the innocent children,[731] wives who before long must go away in the hollow ships,[732] and among them I shall also go, and you, my child, follow[733] where I go, and there do much hard work that is unworthy[734] of you, drudgery for a hard master; or else some Achaian[735] will take you by hand and hurl you from the tower into horrible[736] death, in anger because Hektor once killed his brother,[737] or his father, or his son; there were so many Achaians[738] whose teeth bit the vast earth, beaten down by the hands of Hektor.[739] Your father was no merciful man in the horror of battle.[740] Therefore your people are grieving for you all through their city,[741] Hektor, and you left for your parents mourning and sorrow[742] beyond words, but for me passing all others is left the bitterness[743] and the pain, for you did not die in bed, and stretch your arms to me,[744] nor tell me some last intimate word that I could remember[745] always, all the nights and days of my weeping for you.”[746] So she spoke in tears, and the women were mourning about her.[747] Now Hekabe led out the thronging chant of their sorrow:[748] “Hektor, of all my sons the dearest by far to my spirit;[749] while you still lived for me you were dear to the gods, and even[750] in the stage of death they cared about you still. There were others[751] of my sons whom at times swift-footed Achilleus captured,[752] and he would sell them as slaves far across the unresting salt water[753] into Samos, and Imbros, and Lemnos in the gloom of the mists. You,[754] when he had taken your life with the thin edge of the bronze sword,[755] he dragged again and again around his beloved companion’s[756] tomb, Patroklos’, whom you killed, but even so did not[757] bring him back to life. Now you lie in the palace, handsome[758] and fresh with dew, in the likeness of one whom he of the silver[759] bow, Apollo, has attacked and killed with his gentle arrows.”[760] So she spoke, in tears, and wakened the endless mourning.[761] Third and last Helen led the song of sorrow among them:[762] “Hektor, of all my lord’s brothers dearest by far to my spirit:[763] my husband is Alexandros, like an immortal, who brought me[764] here to Troy; and I should have died before I came with him;[765] and here now is the twentieth year upon me since I came[766] from the place where I was, forsaking the land of my fathers. In this time[767] I have never heard a harsh saying from you, nor an insult.[768] No, but when another, one of my lord’s brothers or sisters, a fair-robed[769] wife of some brother, would say a harsh word to me in the palace,[770] or my lord’s mother—but his father was gentle always, a father[771] indeed—then you would speak and put them off and restrain them[772] by your own gentleness of heart and your gentle words. Therefore[773] I mourn for you in sorrow of heart and mourn myself also[774] and my ill luck. There was no other in all the wide Troad[775] who was kind to me, and my friend; all others shrank when they saw me.”[776] So she spoke in tears, and the vast populace grieved with her.[777] Now Priam the aged king spoke forth his word to his people:[778] “Now, men of Troy, bring timber into the city, and let not[779] your hearts fear a close ambush of the Argives. Achilleus  p 306  [780] promised me, as he sent me on my way from the black ships,[781] that none should do us injury until the twelfth dawn comes.”[782] He spoke, and they harnessed to the wagons their mules and their oxen[783] and presently were gathered in front of the city. Nine days[784] they spent bringing in an endless supply of timber. But when[785] the tenth dawn had shone forth with her light upon mortals,[786] they carried out bold Hektor, weeping, and set the body[787] aloft a towering pyre for burning. And set fire to it.[788] But when the young dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[789] the people gathered around the pyre of illustrious Hektor.[790] But when all were gathered to one place and assembled together,[791] first with gleaming wine they put out the pyre that was burning,[792] all where the fury of the fire still was in force, and thereafter[793] the brothers and companions of Hektor gathered the white bones[794] up, mourning, as the tears swelled and ran down their cheeks. Then[795] they laid what they had gathered up in a golden casket[796] and wrapped this about with soft robes of purple, and presently[797] put it away in the hollow of the grave, and over it[798] piled huge stones laid close together. Lightly and quickly[799] they piled up the grave-barrow, and on all sides were set watchmen[800] for fear the strong-greaved Achaians might too soon set upon them.[801] They piled up the grave-barrow and went away, and thereafter[802] assembled in a fair gathering and held a glorious[803] feast within the house of Priam, king under God’s hand.[804] Such was their burial of Hektor, breaker of horses.  p 307  The Odysseybook one[1] Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways, who was driven[2] far journeys, after he had sacked Troy’s sacred citadel.[3] Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of,[4] many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,[5] struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.[6] Even so he could not save his companions, hard though[7] he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness,[8] fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,[9] and he took away the day of their homecoming. From some point[10] here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story.[11] Then all the others, as many as fled sheer destruction,[12] were at home now, having escaped the sea and the fighting.[13] This one alone, longing for his wife and his homecoming,[14] was detained by the queenly nymph Kalypso, bright among goddesses,[15] in her hollowed caverns, desiring that he should be her husband.[16] But when in the circling of the years that very year came[17] in which the gods had spun for him his time of homecoming[18] to Ithaka, not even then was he free of his trials[19] nor among his own people. But all the gods pitied him[20] except Poseidon; he remained relentlessly angry[21] with godlike Odysseus, until his return to his own country.[22] But Poseidon was gone now to visit the far Aithiopians,[23] Aithiopians, most distant of men, who live divided,[24] some at the setting of Hyperion, some at his rising,[25] to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams. There[26] he sat at the feast and took his pleasure. Meanwhile the other[27] Olympian gods were gathered together in the halls of Zeus.[28] First among them to speak was the father of gods and mortals,[29] for he was thinking in his heart of stately Aigisthos,[30] whom Orestes, Agamemnon’s far-famed son, had murdered.[31] Remembering him he spoke now before the immortals:[32] “Oh for shame, how the mortals put the blame upon us[33] gods, for they say evils come from us, but it is they, rather,[34] who by their own recklessness win sorrow beyond what is given,[35] as now lately, beyond what was given, Aigisthos married[36] the wife of Atreus’ son, and murdered him on his homecoming,[37] though he knew it was sheer destruction, for we ourselves had told him,[38] sending Hermes, the mighty watcher, Argeïphontes,[39] not to kill the man, nor court his lady for marriage;[40] for vengeance would come on him from Orestes, son of Atreides,[41] whenever he came of age and longed for his own country.[42] So Hermes told him, but for all his kind intention he could not[43] persuade the mind of Aigisthos. And now he has paid for everything.”[44] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:  p 308  [45] “Son of Kronos, our father, O lordliest of the mighty,[46] Aigisthos indeed has been struck down in a death well merited.[47] Let any other man who does thus perish as he did.[48] But the heart in me is torn for the sake of wise Odysseus,[49] unhappy man, who still, far from his friends, is suffering[50] griefs, on the sea-washed island, the navel of all the waters,[51] a wooded island, and there a goddess has made her dwelling place;[52] she is daughter of malignant Atlas, who has discovered[53] all the depths of the sea, and himself sustains the towering[54] columns which bracket earth and sky and hold them together.[55] This is his daughter; she detains the grieving, unhappy[56] man, and ever with soft and flattering words she works to[57] charm him to forget Ithaka; and yet Odysseus,[58] straining to get sight of the very smoke uprising[59] from his own country, longs to die. But you, Olympian,[60] the heart in you is heedless of him. Did not Odysseus[61] do you grace by the ships of the Argives, making sacrifice[62] in wide Troy? Why, Zeus, are you now so harsh with him?”[63] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:[64] “My child, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[65] How could I forget Odysseus the godlike, he who[66] is beyond all other men in mind, and who beyond others[67] has given sacrifice to the gods, who hold wide heaven?[68] It is the Earth Encircler Poseidon who, ever relentless,[69] nurses a grudge because of the Cyclops, whose eye he blinded;[70] for Polyphemos like a god, whose power is greatest[71] over all the Cyclopes. Thoösa, a nymph, was his mother,[72] and she was daughter of Phorkys, lord of the barren salt water.[73] She in the hollows of the caves had lain with Poseidon.[74] For his sake Poseidon, shaker of the earth, although he does not[75] kill Odysseus, yet drives him back from the land of his fathers.[76] But come, let all of us who are here work out his homecoming[77] and see to it that he returns. Poseidon shall put away[78] his anger; for all alone and against the will of the other[79] immortal gods united he can accomplish nothing.”[80] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:[81] “Son of Kronos, our father, O lordliest of the mighty,[82] if in truth this is pleasing to the blessed immortals[83] that Odysseus of the many designs shall return home, then[84] let us dispatch Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos,[85] to the island of Ogygia, so that with all speed[86] he may announce to the lovely-haired nymph our absolute purpose,[87] the homecoming of enduring Odysseus, that he shall come back.[88] But I shall make my way to Ithaka, so that I may[89] stir up his son a little, and put some confidence in him[90] to summon into assembly the flowing-haired Achaians[91] and make a statement to all the suitors, who now forever[92] slaughter his crowding sheep and lumbering horn-curved cattle;[93] and I will convey him into Sparta and to sandy Pylos[94] to ask after his dear father’s homecoming, if he can hear something,[95] and so that among people he may win a good reputation.”[96] Speaking so she bound upon her feet the fair sandals,  p 309  [97] golden and immortal, that carried her over the water[98] as over the dry boundless earth abreast of the wind’s blast.[99] Then she caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,[100] heavy, huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting[101] men, against whom she of the mighty father is angered,[102] and descended in a flash of speed from the peaks of Olympos,[103] and lighted in the land of Ithaka, at the doors of Odysseus[104] at the threshold of the court, and in her hand was the bronze spear.[105] She was disguised as a friend, leader of the Taphians, Mentes.[106] There she found the haughty suitors. They at the moment[107] in front of the doors were amusing their spirits with draughts games,[108] sitting about on skins of cattle whom they had slaughtered[109] themselves, and about them, of their heralds and hard-working henchmen,[110] some at the mixing bowls were combining wine and water,[111] while others again with porous sponges were wiping the tables[112] and setting them out, and others cutting meat in quantities.[113] Now far the first to see Athene was godlike Telemachos,[114] as he sat among the suitors, his heart deep grieving within him,[115] imagining in his mind his great father, how he might come back[116] and all throughout the house might cause the suitors to scatter,[117] and hold his rightful place and be lord of his own possessions.[118] With such thoughts, sitting among the suitors, he saw Athene[119] and went straight to the forecourt, the heart within him scandalized[120] that a guest should still be standing at the doors. He stood beside her[121] and took her by the right hand, and relieved her of the bronze spear,[122] and spoke to her and addressed her in winged words: “Welcome, stranger.[123] You shall be entertained as a guest among us. Afterward,[124] when you have tasted dinner, you shall tell us what your need is.”[125] So speaking he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed him.[126] Now, when the two of them were inside the lofty dwelling,[127] he took the spear he carried and set it against a tall column[128] in a rack for spears, of polished wood, where indeed there were other[129] spears of patient-hearted Odysseus standing in numbers,[130] and he led her and seated her in a chair, with a cloth to sit on,[131] the chair splendid and elaborate. For her feet there was a footstool.[132] For himself, he drew a painted bench next her, apart from the others,[133] the suitors, for fear the guest, made uneasy by the uproar,[134] might lose his appetite there among overbearing people,[135] and so he might also ask him about his absent father.[136] A maidservant brought water for them and poured it from a splendid[137] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin[138] for them to wash, and she pulled a polished table before them.[139] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to them,[140] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions,[141] while a carver lifted platters of all kinds of meat and set them[142] in front of them, and placed beside them the golden goblets,[143] and a herald, going back and forth, poured the wine for them.[144] Then the haughty suitors came in, and all of them straightway[145] took their places in order on chairs and along the benches,[146] and their heralds poured water over their hands for them to wash with,[147] and the serving maids brought them bread heaped up in the baskets,[148] and the young men filled the mixing bowls with wine for their drinking.  p 310  [149] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[150] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[151] the suitors found their attention turned to other matters,[152] the song and the dance; for these things come at the end of the feasting.[153] A herald put the beautifully wrought lyre in the hands[154] of Phemios, who sang for the suitors, because they made him.[155] He played his lyre and struck up a fine song. Meanwhile[156] Telemachos talked to Athene of the gray eyes, leaning[157] his head close to hers, so that none of the others might hear him:[158] “Dear stranger, would you be scandalized at what I say to you?[159] This is all they think of, the lyre and the singing. Easy[160] for them, since without penalty they eat up the substance[161] of a man whose white bones lie out in the rain and fester[162] somewhere on the mainland, or roll in the wash of the breakers.[163] If they were ever to see him coming back to Ithaka[164] all the prayer of them all would be to be lighter on their feet[165] instead of to be richer men for gold and clothing.[166] As it is, he has died by an evil fate, and there is no comfort[167] left for us, not even though some one among mortals[168] tells us he will come back. His day of homecoming has perished.[169] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[170] What man are you, and whence? Where is your city? Your parents?[171] What kind of ship did you come here on? And how did the sailors[172] bring you to Ithaka? What men do they claim that they are?[173] For I do not think you could have traveled on foot to this country.[174] And tell me this too, tell me truly, so that I may know it.[175] Are you here for the first time, or are you a friend of my father’s[176] from abroad? Since many other men too used to come and visit[177] our house, in the days when he used to go about among people.”[178] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:[179] “See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[180] I announce myself as Mentes, son of Anchialos[181] the wise, and my lordship is over the oar-loving Taphians.[182] Now I have come in as you see, with my ship and companions[183] sailing over the wine-blue water to men of alien language,[184] to Temese, after bronze, and my cargo is gleaming iron.[185] And my ship stands near by, at the country, away from the city,[186] at the harbor, Rheithron, underneath wooden Neion.[187] Your father and I claim to be guest-friends by heredity[188] from far back, as you would know if you went to the aged hero[189] Laertes, who, they say, no longer comes to the city[190] now, but away by himself on his own land leads a hard life[191] with an old woman to look after him, who serves him his victuals[192] and drink, at the times when the weariness has befallen his body[193] from making his toilsome way on the high ground of his vineyard.[194] Now I have come. They told me he was here in this country,[195] your father, I mean. But no. The gods are impeding his passage.[196] For no death on the land has befallen the great Odysseus,[197] but somewhere, alive on the wide sea, he is held captive,[198] on a sea-washed island, and savage men have him in their keeping,[199] rough men, who somehow keep him back, though he is unwilling.[200] Now, I will make you a prophecy, in the way the immortals  p 311  [201] put it into my mind, and as I think it will come out,[202] though I am no prophet, nor do I know the ways of birds clearly.[203] He will not long be absent from the beloved land of his fathers,[204] even if the bonds that hold him are iron, but he will be thinking[205] of a way to come back, since he is a man of many resources.[206] But come now tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[207] Are you, big as you are, the very child of Odysseus?[208] Indeed, you are strangely like about the head, the fine eyes,[209] as I remember; we used to meet so often together[210] before he went away to Troy, where others beside him[211] and the greatest of the Argives went in their hollow vessels.[212] Since that time I have not seen Odysseus nor has he seen me.”[213] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[214] “See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[215] My mother says indeed I am his. I for my part[216] do not know. Nobody really knows his own father.[217] But how I wish I could have been rather son to some fortunate[218] man, whom old age overtook among his possessions.[219] But of mortal men, that man has proved the most ill-fated[220] whose son they say I am: since you question me on this matter.”[221] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:[222] “The gods have not made yours a birth that will go nameless[223] hereafter, since Penelope bore such a son as you are.[224] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[225] What feast is this, what gathering? How does it concern you?[226] A festival, or a wedding? Surely, no communal dinner.[227] How insolently they seem to swagger about in their feasting[228] all through the house. A serious man who came in among them[229] could well be scandalized, seeing much disgraceful behavior.”[230] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[231] “My guest, since indeed you are asking me all these questions,[232] there was a time this house was one that might be prosperous[233] and above reproach, when a certain man was here in his country.[234] But now the gods, with evil intention, have willed it otherwise,[235] and they have caused him to disappear, in a way no other[236] man has done. I should not have sorrowed so over his dying[237] if he had gone down among his companions in the land of the Trojans,[238] or in the arms of his friends, after he had wound up the fighting.[239] So all the Achaians would have heaped a grave mound over him,[240] and he would have won great fame for himself and his son hereafter.[241] But now ingloriously the stormwinds have caught and carried him[242] away, out of sight, out of knowledge, and he left pain and lamentation[243] to me. Nor is it for him alone that I grieve in my pain now.[244] No longer. For the gods have inflicted other cares on me.[245] For all the greatest men who have the power in the islands,[246] in Doulichion and Same and in wooded Zakynthos,[247] and all who in rocky Ithaka are holders of lordships,[248] all these are after my mother for marriage, and wear my house out.[249] And she does not refuse the hateful marriage, nor is she able[250] to make an end of the matter; and these eating up my substance[251] waste it away; and soon they will break me myself to pieces.”[252] Pallas Athene answered him in great indignation:  p 312  [253] “Oh, for shame. How great your need is now of the absent[254] Odysseus, who would lay his hands on these shameless suitors.[255] I wish he could come now to stand in the outer doorway[256] of his house, wearing a helmet and carrying shield and two spears,[257] the way he was the first time that ever I saw him[258] in our own house, drinking his wine and taking his pleasure,[259] coming in from Ephyre and from Ilos son of Mermeros.[260] Odysseus, you see, had gone there also in his swift ship[261] in search of a poison to kill men, so he might have it[262] to smear on his bronze-headed arrows, but Ilos would not[263] give him any, since he feared the gods who endure forever.[264] But my father did give it to him, so terribly did he love him.[265] I wish that such an Odysseus would come now among the suitors.[266] They all would find death was quick, and marriage a painful matter.[267] Yet all these are things that are lying upon the gods’ knees:[268] whether he will come home to his vengeance, here in his household,[269] or whether he will not. Rather I will urge you to consider[270] some means by which you can force the suitors out of your household.[271] Come now, pay close attention to me and do as I tell you.[272] Tomorrow, summon the Achaian warriors into assembly[273] and publish your word to all, let the gods be your witnesses.[274] Tell the suitors to scatter and go back to their own holdings,[275] and as for your mother, if the spirit urges her to be married,[276] let her go back to the palace of her powerful father,[277] and they shall appoint the marriage and arrange for the wedding presents[278] in great amount, as ought to go with a beloved daughter.[279] But for yourself, I will counsel you shrewdly, and hope you will listen.[280] Fit out a ship with twenty oars, the best you can come by,[281] and go out to ask about your father who is so long absent,[282] on the chance some mortal man can tell you, who has listened to Rumor[283] sent by Zeus. She more than others spreads news among people.[284] First go to Pylos, and there question the great Nestor,[285] and from there go over to Sparta to see fair-haired Menelaos,[286] since he came home last of all the bronze-armored Achaians.[287] Thus if you hear your father is alive and on his way home,[288] then, hard pressed though you are, you should still hold out for another[289] year. But if you hear he has died and lives no longer,[290] then make your way home to the beloved land of your fathers,[291] and pile up a tomb in his honor, and there make sacrifices[292] in great amount, as is fitting. And give your mother to a husband.[293] Then, after you have made an end of these matters, and done them,[294] next you must consider well in your heart and spirit[295] some means by which you can kill the suitors who are in your household,[296] by treachery or open attack. You should not go on[297] clinging to your childhood. You are no longer of an age to do that.[298] Or have you not heard what glory was won by great Orestes[299] among all mankind, when he killed the murderer of his father,[300] the treacherous Aigisthos, who had slain his famous father?[301] So you too, dear friend, since I can see you are big and splendid,[302] be bold also, so that in generations to come they will praise you.[303] But now it is time for me to go back down to my fast ship  p 313  [304] and my companions, who must be very restless waiting[305] for me. Let all this be on your mind, and do as I tell you.”[306] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[307] “My guest, your words to me are very kind and considerate,[308] what any father would say to his son. I shall not forget them.[309] But come now, stay with me, eager though you are for your journey,[310] so that you may first bathe and take your ease and, well rested[311] and happy in your heart, then go back to your ship with a present,[312] something prized, altogether fine, which will be your keepsake[313] from me, what loving guests and hosts bestow on each other.”[314] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:[315] “Do not detain me longer, eager as I am for my journey;[316] and that gift, whatever it is your dear heart bids you give me,[317] save it to give when I come next time, so I can take it[318] home; and choose a good one, and a fair exchange will befall you.”[319] So spoke the goddess gray-eyed Athene, and there she departed[320] like a bird soaring high in the air, but she left in his spirit[321] determination and courage, and he remembered his father[322] even more than he had before, and he guessed the meaning,[323] and his heart was full of wonder, for he thought it was a divinity.[324] At once he went over, a godlike man, to sit with the suitors.[325] The famous singer was singing to them, and they in silence[326] sat listening. He sang of the Achaians’ bitter homecoming[327] from Troy, which Pallas Athene had inflicted upon them.[328] The daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[329] heard and heeded the magical song from her upper chamber,[330] and descended the high staircase that was built in her palace,[331] not all alone, since two handmaidens went to attend her.[332] When she, shining among women, came near the suitors,[333] she stood by the pillar that supported the roof with its joinery,[334] holding her shining veil in front of her face, to shield it,[335] and a devoted attendant was stationed on either side of her.[336] All in tears she spoke then to the divine singer:[337] “Phemios, since you know many other actions of mortals[338] and gods, which can charm men’s hearts and which the singers celebrate,[339] sit beside them and sing one of these, and let them in silence[340] go on drinking their wine, but leave off singing this sad[341] song, which always afflicts the dear heart deep inside me,[342] since the unforgettable sorrow comes to me, beyond others,[343] so dear a head do I long for whenever I am reminded[344] of my husband, whose fame goes wide through Hellas and midmost Argos.”[345] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[346] “Why, my mother, do you begrudge this excellent singer[347] his pleasing himself as the thought drives him? It is not the singers[348] who are to blame, it must be Zeus is to blame, who gives out[349] to men who eat bread, to each and all, the way he wills it.[350] There is nothing wrong in his singing the sad return of the Danaans.[351] People, surely, always give more applause to that song[352] which is the latest to circulate among the listeners.[353] So let your heart and let your spirit be hardened to listen.[354] Odysseus is not the only one who lost his homecoming  p 314  [355] day at Troy. There were many others who perished, besides him.[356] Go therefore back in the house, and take up your own work,[357] the loom and the distaff, and see to it that your handmaidens[358] ply their work also; but the men must see to discussion,[359] all men, but I most of all. For mine is the power in this household.”[360] Penelope went back inside the house, in amazement,[361] for she laid the serious words of her son deep away in her spirit,[362] and she went back to the upper story with her attendant[363] women, and wept for Odysseus, her beloved husband, until[364] gray-eyed Athene cast sweet slumber over her eyelids.[365] But the suitors all through the shadowy halls were raising a tumult,[366] and all prayed for the privilege of lying beside her,[367] until the thoughtful Telemachos began speaking among them:[368] “You suitors of my mother, overbearing in your rapacity,[369] now let us dine and take our pleasure, and let there be no[370] shouting, since it is a splendid thing to listen to a singer[371] who is such a singer as this man is, with a voice such as gods have.[372] Then tomorrow let us all go to the place of assembly,[373] and hold a session, where I will give you my forthright statement,[374] that you go out of my palace and do your feasting elsewhere,[375] eating up your own possessions, taking turns, household by household.[376] But if you decide it is more profitable and better[377] to go on, eating up one man’s livelihood, without payment,[378] then spoil my house. I will cry out to the gods everlasting[379] in the hope that Zeus might somehow grant a reversal of fortunes.[380] Then you may perish in this house, with no payment given.”[381] So he spoke, and all of them bit their lips, in amazement[382] at Telemachos and the daring way he had spoken to them.[383] It was Antinoös the son of Eupeithes who answered:[384] “Telemachos, surely it must be the very gods who prompt you[385] to take the imperious line and speak so daringly to us.[386] I hope the son of Kronos never makes you our king in seagirt[387] Ithaka. Though to be sure that is your right by inheritance.”[388] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[389] “Antinoös, in case you wonder at what I am saying,[390] I would be willing to take that right, if Zeus should give it.[391] Do you think that is the worst thing that could happen to anyone?[392] It is not bad to be a king. Speedily the king’s house[393] grows prosperous, and he himself has rank beyond others.[394] But in fact there are many other Achaian princes,[395] young and old, in seagirt Ithaka, any of whom might[396] hold this position, now that the great Odysseus has perished.[397] But I will be the absolute lord over my own household[398] and my servants, whom the great Odysseus won by force for me.”[399] Then in turn Eurymachos, son of Polybos, answered:[400] “Telemachos, these matters, and which of the Achaians will be king[401] in seagirt Ithaka, are questions that lie on the gods’ knees.[402] But I hope you keep your possessions and stay lord in your own household.[403] May the man never come who against your will and by force shall drive you[404] away from your holdings, while Ithaka is a place still lived in.[405] But, best of men, I wish to ask you about this stranger,[406] where he came from, what country he announces as being[407] his own, where lies his parent stock, and the fields of his fathers.  p 315  [408] Has he brought some message from your father who is on his way here?[409] Or did he arrive pursuing some matter of his own business?[410] How suddenly he started away and vanished, and did not[411] wait to be made known. He was no mean man, by the look of him.”[412] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[413] “Eurymachos, there is no more hope of my father’s homecoming.[414] I believe no messages any more, even should there be one,[415] nor pay attention to any prophecy, those times my mother[416] calls some diviner into the house and asks him questions.[417] This stranger is a friend of my father’s. He comes from Taphos[418] and announces himself as Mentes, the son of Anchialos[419] the wise. And he is lord of the lovers of the oar, the Taphians.”[420] So spoke Telemachos, but in his heart he knew the immortal[421] goddess. The others, turning to the dance and the delightful[422] song, took their pleasure and awaited the coming of evening,[423] and the black evening came on as they were taking their pleasure.[424] Then they went home to go to bed, each to his own house,[425] but Telemachos went where, off the splendid courtyard, a lofty[426] bedchamber had been built for him, in a sheltered corner.[427] There he went to go to bed, his heart full of problems,[428] and devoted Eurykleia went with him, and carried the flaring[429] torches. She was the daughter of Ops the son of Peisenor,[430] and Laertes had bought her long ago with his own possessions[431] when she was still in her first youth, and gave twenty oxen for her,[432] and he favored her in his house as much as his own devoted[433] wife, but never slept with her, for fear of his wife’s anger.[434] She now carried the flaring torches for him. She loved him[435] more than the other maidservants, and had nursed him when he was little.[436] He opened the doors of the close-compacted bedchamber,[437] and sat down on the bed and took off his soft tunic[438] and put it into the hands of the sagacious old woman,[439] and she in turn folded the tunic, and took care of it for him,[440] and hung it up on a peg beside the corded bedstead.[441] Then she went out of the room, and pulled the door to behind her[442] with a silver hook, and with a strap drew home the door bolt.[443] There, all night long, wrapped in a soft sheepskin, he pondered[444] in his heart the journey that Pallas Athene had counseled.book two[1] Now when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[2] the dear son of Odysseus stirred from where he was sleeping,[3] and put on his clothes, and slung a sharp sword over his shoulder.[4] Underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals[5] and went on his way from the chamber, like a god in presence.[6] He gave the word now to his clear-voiced heralds to summon[7] by proclamation to assembly the flowing-haired Achaians,[8] and the heralds made their cry, and the men were assembled swiftly.[9] Now when they were all assembled in one place together,[10] he went on his way to assembly, in his hands holding a bronze spear,[11] not all alone, but a pair of light-footed dogs went with him.[12] Athene drifted an enchantment of grace upon him,  p 316  [13] and all the people had their eyes on him as he came forward.[14] He sat in his father’s seat, and the elders made way before him.[15] The first now to speak to them was the hero Aigyptios,[16] who was bent over with age, and had seen things beyond number.[17] His own dear son, Antiphos the spearman, had gone off[18] with godlike Odysseus to Ilion, land of good horses,[19] in the hollow ships, and now the wild Cyclops had killed him[20] deep in his cave, and this was the last man he had eaten.[21] He had three other sons. One of them, Eurynomos,[22] went with the suitors; the other two kept the estates of their fathers.[23] Even so, he could not forget the lost one. He grieved and mourned for him,[24] and it was in tears for him, now, that he stood forth and addressed them:[25] “Hear me now, men of Ithaka, and the word I give you.[26] Never has there been an assembly of us or any session[27] since great Odysseus went away in the hollow vessels.[28] Now who has gathered us, in this way? What need has befallen[29] which of the younger men, or one of us who are older?[30] Has he been hearing some message about the return of the army[31] which, having heard it first, he could now explain to us?[32] Or has he some other public matter to set forth and argue?[33] I think he is a good man and useful. So may Zeus grant him[34] good accomplishment for whatever it is his mind desires.”[35] He spoke, and the dear son of Odysseus was glad for the omen,[36] nor did he remain seated long, his heart was for speaking,[37] and he stood in the middle of the assembly. The herald Peisenor,[38] a man of deep discretion, put into his hands the scepter.[39] First, in answer to the old man, he spoke and addressed him:[40] “Old sir, the man is not far, but here; you yourself shall know him.[41] It is I who assembled the people. To me this grief comes closest.[42] Not that I heard some message about the return of the army,[43] which, having heard it first, I could now explain to you;[44] nor have I some other public matter to set forth and argue,[45] but my own need, the evil that has befallen my household.[46] There are two evils. I have lost a noble father, one who[47] was king once over you here, and was kind to you like a father;[48] and now here is a greater evil, one which presently[49] will break up the whole house and destroy all my livelihood.[50] For my mother, against her will, is beset by suitors,[51] own sons to the men who are greatest hereabouts. These[52] shrink from making the journey to the house of her father[53] Ikarios, so that he might take bride gifts for his daughter[54] and bestow her on the one he wished, who came as his favorite;[55] rather, all their days, they come and loiter in our house[56] and sacrifice our oxen and our sheep and our fat goats[57] and make a holiday feast of it and drink the bright wine[58] recklessly. Most of our substance is wasted. We have no man here[59] such as Odysseus was, to drive this curse from the household.[60] We ourselves are not the men to do it; we must be[61] weaklings in such a case, not men well seasoned in battle.[62] I would defend myself if the power were in me. No longer[63] are the things endurable that have been done, and beyond all decency[64] my house has been destroyed. Even you must be scandalized  p 317  [65] and ashamed before the neighboring men about us, the people[66] who live around our land; fear also the gods’ anger,[67] lest they, astonished by evil actions, turn against you.[68] I supplicate you, by Zeus the Olympian and by Themis[69] who breaks up the assemblies of men and calls them in session:[70] let be, my friends, and leave me alone with my bitter sorrow[71] to waste away; unless my noble father Odysseus[72] at some time in anger did evil to the strong-greaved Achaians,[73] for which angry with me in revenge you do me evil[74] in setting these on me. But for me it would be far better[75] for you to eat away my treasures and eat my cattle.[76] If you were to eat them, there might be a recompense someday,[77] for we could go through all the settlement, with claims made public[78] asking for our goods again, until it was all regiven.[79] But now you are heaping me with troubles I cannot deal with.”[80] So he spoke in anger, and dashed to the ground the scepter[81] in a stormburst of tears; and pity held all the people.[82] Now all the rest were stricken to silence, none was so hardy[83] as to answer, angry word against word, the speech of Telemachos.[84] It was Antinoös alone spoke to him in answer:[85] “High-spoken intemperate Telemachos, what accusations[86] you have made to our shame, trying to turn opinion against us![87] And yet you have no cause to blame the Achaian suitors,[88] but it is your own dear mother, and she is greatly resourceful.[89] And now it is the third year, and will be the fourth year presently,[90] since she has been denying the desires of the Achaians.[91] For she holds out hope to all, and makes promises to each man,[92] sending us messages, but her mind has other intentions.[93] And here is another strategem of her heart’s devising.[94] She set up a great loom in her palace, and set to weaving[95] a web of threads long and fine. Then she said to us:[96] ‘Young men, my suitors now that the great Odysseus has perished,[97] wait, though you are eager to marry me, until I finish[98] this web, so that my weaving will not be useless and wasted.[99] This is a shroud for the hero Laertes, for when the destructive[100] doom of death which lays men low shall take him, lest any[101] Achaian woman in this neighborhood hold it against me[102] that a man of many conquests lies with no sheet to wind him.’[103] So she spoke, and the proud heart in us was persuaded.[104] Thereafter in the daytime she would weave at her great loom,[105] but in the night she would have torches set by, and undo it.[106] So for three years she was secret in her design, convincing[107] the Achaians, but when the fourth year came with the seasons returning,[108] one of her women, who knew the whole of the story, told us,[109] and we found her in the act of undoing her glorious weaving.[110] So, against her will and by force, she had to finish it.[111] Now the suitors answer you thus, so that you yourself[112] may know it in your mind, and all the Achaians may know it:[113] send your mother back, and instruct her to be married[114] to any man her father desires and who pleases her also.[115] But if she continues to torment the sons of the Achaians,[116] since she is so dowered with the wisdom bestowed by Athene,  p 318  [117] to be expert in beautiful work, to have good character[118] and cleverness, such as we are not told of, even of the ancient[119] queens, the fair-tressed Achaian women of times before us,[120] Tyro and Alkmene and Mykene, wearer of garlands;[121] for none of these knew thoughts so wise as those Penelope[122] knew; yet in this single matter she did not think rightly;[123] so long, I say, will your livelihood and possessions be eaten[124] away, as long as she keeps this purpose, one which the very[125] gods, I think, put into her heart. She is winning a great name[126] for herself, but for you she is causing much loss of substance.[127] We will not go back to our own estates, nor will we go elsewhere[128] until she marries whichever Achaian man she fancies.”[129] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[130] “Antinoös, I cannot thrust the mother who bore me,[131] who raised me, out of the house against her will. My father,[132] alive or dead, is elsewhere in the world. It will be hard[133] to pay back Ikarios, if willingly I dismiss my mother.[134] I will suffer some evil from her father, and the spirit will give me[135] more yet, for my mother will call down her furies upon me[136] as she goes out of the house, and I shall have the people’s[137] resentment. I will not be the one to say that word to her.[138] But as for you, if your feeling is scandalized by my answer,[139] go away from my palace and do your feasting elsewhere,[140] eating up your own possessions, taking turns, household by household.[141] But if you decide it is more profitable and better[142] to go on, eating up one man’s livelihood, without payment,[143] then spoil my house. I will cry out to the gods everlasting[144] in the hope that Zeus might somehow grant a reversal of fortunes.[145] Then you may perish in this house with no payment given.”[146] So spoke Telemachos, and for his sake Zeus of the wide brows[147] sent forth two eagles, soaring high from the peak of the mountain.[148] These for a while sailed on the stream of the wind together,[149] wing and wing, close together, wings spread wide. But when[150] they were over the middle of the vociferous assembly,[151] they turned on each other suddenly in a thick shudder[152] of wings, and swooped over the heads of all, with eyes glaring[153] and deadly, and tore each other by neck and cheek with their talons,[154] then sped away to the right across the houses and city.[155] Then all were astounded at the birds, when their eyes saw them,[156] and they pondered in their hearts over what might come of it,[157] and Halitherses, Mastor’s son, an aged warrior,[158] spoke to them. He was far beyond the men of his generation[159] in understanding the meaning of birds and reading their portents.[160] Now, in kind intention toward all, he spoke and addressed them:[161] “Hear me now, men of Ithaka, what I have to tell you;[162] but what I say will be mostly a warning to the suitors,[163] for a great disaster is wheeling down on them. Surely Odysseus[164] will not be long away from his family, but now, already,[165] is somewhere close by, working out the death and destruction[166] of all these men, and it will be an evil for many others[167] of us who inhabit sunny Ithaka. So, well beforehand,[168] let us think how we can make them stop, or better let them  p 319  [169] stop themselves. It will soon be better for them if they do so.[170] I who foretell this am not untried, I know what I am saying.[171] Concerning him, I say that everything was accomplished[172] in the way I said it would be at the time the Argives took ship[173] for Ilion, and with them went resourceful Odysseus.[174] I said that after much suffering, with all his companions[175] lost, in the twentieth year, not recognized by any,[176] he would come home. And now all this is being accomplished.”[177] Then in turn Eurymachos, son of Polybos, answered:[178] “Old sir, better go home and prophesy to your children,[179] for fear they may suffer some evil to come. In these things[180] I can give a much better interpretation than you can.[181] Many are the birds who under the sun’s rays wander[182] the sky; not all of them mean anything; Odysseus[183] is dead, far away, and how I wish that you had died with him[184] also. Then you would not be announcing all these predictions,[185] nor would you so stir up Telemachos, who is now angry,[186] looking for the gift for your own household, which he might give you.[187] But I will tell you straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished:[188] if you, who know much and have known it long, stir up a younger[189] man, and by talking him round with words encourage his anger,[190] then first of all, it will be the worse for him; he will not[191] on account of all these sayings be able to accomplish anything;[192] and on you, old sir, we shall lay a penalty, and it will grieve your[193] mind as you pay it, and that for you will be a great sorrow.[194] I myself, before you all, will advise Telemachos.[195] Let him urge his mother to go back to her father’s,[196] and they shall appoint the marriage and arrange for the wedding presents[197] in great amount, as ought to go with a beloved daughther.[198] For I think the sons of the Achaians will not give over[199] their harsh courtship, for in any case we fear no one,[200] and surely not Telemachos, for all he is so eloquent.[201] Nor do we care for any prophecy, which you, old sir,[202] may tell us, which will not happen, and will make you even more hated;[203] and his possessions will wretchedly be eaten away, there will not[204] be compensation, ever, while she makes the Achaians put off[205] marriage with her, while we, awaiting this, all our days[206] quarrel for the sake of her excellence, nor ever go after[207] others, whom any one of us might properly marry.”[208] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[209] “Eurymachos, and all you others who are haughty suitors,[210] I no longer entreat you in these matters, nor speak about them,[211] since by now the gods know about this, as do all the Achaians.[212] But come now, grant me a swift ship, and twenty companions[213] who can convey me on a course from one place to another.[214] For I am going to Sparta and going to sandy Pylos[215] to ask about the homecoming of my father, who is long absent,[216] on the chance of some mortal man telling me, or of hearing a Rumor[217] sent by Zeus. She more than others spreads news among people.[218] Then if I hear my father is alive and on his way home,[219] then, hard pressed though I be, I will still hold out for another[220] year. But if I hear he has died and lives no longer,  p 320  [221] then I will make my way home to the beloved land of my fathers,[222] and pile up a tomb in his honor, and there make sacrifices[223] in great amount, as is fitting. And give my mother to a husband.”[224] So he spoke, and sat down again, and among them rose up[225] Mentor, who once had been the companion of stately Odysseus,[226] and Odysseus, going on the ships, had turned over the household[227] to the old man, to keep it well, and so all should obey him.[228] He in kind intention now spoke forth and addressed them:[229] “Hear me now, men to Ithaka, what I have to tell you.[230] No longer now let one who is a sceptered king be eager[231] to be gentle and kind, be one whose thought is schooled in justice,[232] but let him always rather be harsh, and act severely,[233] seeing the way no one of the people he was lord over[234] remembers godlike Odysseus, and he was kind, like a father.[235] Now it is not so much the proud suitors I resent[236] for doing their violent acts by their minds’ evil devising;[237] for they lay their heads on the line when violently they eat up[238] the house of Odysseus, who, they say to themselves, will not come back;[239] but now I hold it against you other people, how you all[240] sit there in silence, and never with an assault of words try[241] to check the suitors, though they are so few, and you so many.”[242] Then Leokritos, son of Euenor, spoke forth against him:[243] “Mentor, reckless in words, wild in your wits, what a thing[244] you have said, urging them to stop us. It would be difficult[245] even with more men than these to fight us over our feasting.[246] For even if Odysseus of Ithaka himself were to[247] come back, and find the haughty suitors feasting in his house,[248] and be urgent in his mind to drive them out of his palace,[249] his wife would have no joy of his coming, though she longs for it[250] greatly, but rather he would meet an unworthy destiny[251] if he fought against too many. You have spoken to no purpose.[252] Come then, all people disperse now, each to his own holdings,[253] and Mentor and Halitherses will push forward this man’s journey,[254] since these from the first have been his friends, as friends of his father.[255] But, I think, he will sit still for a long time, waiting for messages[256] here in Ithaka, and will never accomplish this voyage.”[257] So he spoke, and suddenly broke up the assembly,[258] and the people scattered and went their ways, each to his own house,[259] while the suitors went away into the house of godlike Odysseus.[260] But Telemachos, walking along the sea beach away from the others,[261] washed his hands in the gray salt water and prayed to Athene:[262] “Hear me, you who came yesterday, a god, into our house[263] and urged me on to go by ship out over the misty[264] face of the sea, to ask about the homecoming of my father[265] who is so long absent: now all this is delayed by the Achaians[266] and particularly the suitors in their evil overconfidence.”[267] So he spoke in prayer, and from nearby Athene came to him[268] likening herself to Mentor in voice and appearance.[269] Now she spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[270] “Telemachos, you are to be no thoughtless man, no coward,[271] if truly the strong force of your father is instilled in you;[272] such a man he was for accomplishing word and action.  p 321  [273] Your journey then will be no vain thing nor go unaccomplished.[274] But if you are not the seed begotten of him and Penelope,[275] I have no hope that you will accomplish all that you strive for.[276] For few are the children who turn out to be equals of their fathers,[277] and the greater number are worse; few are better than their father is.[278] But since you are to be no thoughtless man, no coward,[279] and the mind of Odysseus has not altogether given out in you,[280] there is some hope that you can bring all these things to fulfillment.[281] So now, let be the purpose and the planning of these senseless[282] suitors, since they are neither thoughtful men nor just men,[283] and have not realized the death and black fatality[284] that stands close by, so that on a day they all must perish.[285] And that journey for which you are so urgent will not be long now,[286] such a companion am I to you, as of your father.[287] I will fit you out a fast ship, I myself will go with you.[288] But now you must go back to the house, and join the suitors,[289] and get ready provisions for the journey, pack all in containers,[290] have wine in handled jars, and barley meal, men’s marrow,[291] in thick leather bags, and I, going round the town, will assemble[292] volunteer companions to go with you. There are ships in plenty[293] here in seagirt Ithaka, both old and new ones,[294] and I will look them over for you to find out the best one,[295] and soon we shall stow our gear and put out onto the wide sea.”[296] So spoke Athene, daughter of Zeus, nor did Telemachos[297] delay long after he had heard the voice of the goddess,[298] but went on his way to the house, the heart troubled within him.[299] He came upon the haughty suitors, there in his palace,[300] skinning goats and singeing fatted swine in the courtyard.[301] Antinoös, with a smile, came straight up to Telemachos,[302] and took him by the hand and spoke and named him, saying:[303] “High-spoken intemperate Telemachos, now let no other[304] evil be considered in your heart, neither action[305] nor word, but eat and drink with me, as you did in past time.[306] The Achaians will see to it that all these things are accomplished,[307] the ship, and chosen companions, so that you may the more quickly[308] reach sacred Pylos, after news about your proud father.”[309] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[310] “Antinoös, there is no way for me to dine with you[311] against my will, and take my ease, when you are so insolent.[312] Is it not enough, you suitors, that in time past you ruined[313] my great and good possessions, when I was still in my childhood?[314] But now, when I am grown big, and by listening to others[315] can learn the truth, and the anger is steaming up inside me,[316] I will endeavor to visit evil destructions upon you,[317] either by going to Pylos, or remaining here in the district.[318] But I will go; that journey I speak of will not be made void;[319] but as a passenger; for I control no ship, not any[320] companions; this, I think, was the way you wished to have it.”[321] He spoke, and lightly drew away his hand from Antinoös’[322] hand, but the suitors about the house prepared their dinner,[323] and in their conversation they insulted him and mocked him,[324] and thus would go the word of one of the arrogant young men:  p 322  [325] “Surely now Telemachos is devising our murder.[326] Either he will bring some supporters from sandy Pylos,[327] or even from Sparta, now he is so terribly eager;[328] or perhaps his purpose is to go to Ephyre, that rich[329] corn land, so that thence he can bring back poisonous medicines[330] and put them into our wine bowl, and so destroy all of us.”[331] And thus would speak another one of these arrogant young men:[332] “Who knows whether, when he goes in a hollow ship, he also[333] might perish straying far from his people, as did Odysseus?[334] Were this to happen, he would lighten all our work for us.[335] Then we could divide up his possessions, and give the house[336] to this man’s mother to keep, and to the man who marries her.”[337] So they spoke, but he went down into his father’s high-roofed[338] and wide storeroom, where gold and bronze were lying piled up,[339] and abundant clothing in the bins, and fragrant olive oil,[340] and in it jars of wine, sweet to drink, aged,[341] were standing, keeping the unmixed divine drink inside them,[342] lined up in order close to the wall, for the day when Odysseus[343] might come home even after laboring through many hardships.[344] To close it there were double doors that fitted together[345] with two halves, and there by night and day was a woman[346] in charge who, with intelligent care, watched over all this,[347] Eurykleia the daughter of Ops the son of Peisenor.[348] Now Telemachos called her to the room, and spoke to her:[349] “Dear nurse, come, draw me some sweet wine in the handled[350] jars, choicest of all you have in your keeping, next after[351] what you are saving for the ill-fated man, the day when Zeus-sprung[352] Odysseus might come home, escaping death and its spirits.[353] Fill me twelve in all and fit them all with covers.[354] And pour me barley into bags stitched strongly, of leather.[355] Let me have twenty measures of the choice milled barley. You be[356] the only one that knows this. Let all be gathered together,[357] for I will pick it up in the evening, after my mother[358] climbs to her upper chamber and is ready for sleeping.[359] For I am going into Sparta and to sandy Pylos,[360] to ask after my dear father’s homecoming, if I might hear something.”[361] So he spoke, and the dear nurse Eurykleia cried out,[362] and bitterly lamenting she addressed him in winged words:[363] “Why, my beloved child, has this intention come into[364] your mind? Why do you wish to wander over much country,[365] you, an only and loved son? Illustrious Odysseus[366] has perished far from his country in some outlandish region.[367] And these men will devise evils against you, on your returning,[368] so you shall die by guile, and they divide all that is yours.[369] No, but stay here and guard your possessions. It is not right[370] for you to wander and suffer hardships on the barren wide sea.”[371] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[372] “Do not fear, nurse. This plan was not made without a god’s will.[373] But swear to tell my beloved mother nothing about this[374] until the eleventh day has come or the twelfth hereafter,[375] or until she misses me herself or hears I am absent,[376] so that she may not ruin her lovely skin with weeping.”  p 323  [377] So he spoke, and the old woman swore to the gods a great oath,[378] and after she had sworn to it and completed the oath taking,[379] she drew the wine in the handled jars at once thereafter[380] and poured his barley into bags stitched strongly of leather,[381] but Telemachos went back into the house and joined the suitors.[382] Now the gray-eyed goddess Athene thought what to do next.[383] In the likeness of Telemachos she went all through the city[384] and, standing beside each man as she came to him, told them[385] all to assemble beside the fast ship in the evening.[386] Then she asked Noëmon, the glorious son of Phronios,[387] for a fast ship. And he with good will promised it to her.[388] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.[389] Now she drew the fast ship down to the sea, and in her[390] stowed all the running gear that strong-benched vessels carry.[391] She set it at the edge of the harbor, and around her the good companions[392] thronged and were assembled and the goddess urged on each man.[393] Now the gray-eyed goddess Athene thought what to do next.[394] She went on her way, into the house of godlike Odysseus,[395] and there she drifted a sweet slumber over the suitors,[396] and struck them as they drank, and knocked the goblets out of[397] their hands, and they went to sleep in the city, nor did any one[398] sit long, after sleep was fallen upon his eyelids.[399] Afterward gray-eyed Athene spoke to Telemachos[400] when she had called him out from the well-established palace,[401] likening herself to Mentor in voice and appearance:[402] “Telemachos, already now your strong-greaved companions[403] are sitting at the oars, and waiting for you to set forth.[404] So let us go, and not delay our voyaging longer.”[405] So spoke Pallas Athene, and she led the way swiftly,[406] and the man followed behind her walking in the god’s footsteps.[407] But when they had come down to the sea, and where the ship was,[408] they found the flowing-haired companions there by the seashore.[409] Now the hallowed prince, Telemachos, spoke his word to them:[410] “Here, friends, let us carry the provisions. They are all ready[411] and stacked in the hall. But my mother has been told nothing of this,[412] nor the rest of the serving women. Only one knows the story.”[413] So he spoke and led the way, and the rest went with him.[414] They all carried the provisions down, and stowed them in the strong-benched[415] vessel, in the way the dear son of Odysseus directed them.[416] Telemachos went aboard the ship, but Athene went first[417] and took her place in the stern of the ship, and close beside her[418] Telemachos took his place. The men cast off the stern cables[419] and themselves also went aboard and sat to the oarlocks.[420] The goddess gray-eyed Athene sent them a favoring stern wind,[421] strong Zephyros, who murmured over the wine-blue water.[422] Telemachos then gave the sign and urged his companions[423] to lay hold of the tackle, and they listened to his urging[424] and, raising the mast pole made of fir, they set it upright[425] in the hollow hole in the box, and made it fast with forestays,[426] and with halyards strongly twisted of leather pulled up the white sails.[427] The wind blew into the middle of the sail, and at the cutwater  p 324  [428] a blue wave rose and sang strongly as the ship went onward.[429] She ran swiftly, cutting across the swell her pathway.[430] When they had made fast the running gear all along the black ship,[431] then they set up mixing bowls, filling them brimful[432] with wine, and poured to the gods immortal and everlasting[433] but beyond all other gods they poured to Zeus’ gray-eyed daughter.[434] All night long and into the dawn she ran on her journey.book three[1] Helios, leaving behind the lovely standing waters, rose up[2] into the brazen sky to shine upon the immortals[3] and also on mortal men across the grain-giving farmland.[4] They came to Pylos, Neleus’ strong-founded citadel,[5] where the people on the shore of the sea were making sacrifice[6] of bulls who were all black to the dark-haired Earthshaker.[7] There were nine settlements of them, and in each five hundred[8] holdings, and from each of these nine bulls were provided.[9] Now as these tasted the entrails, and burned, for the god, the thigh bones,[10] these others put straight in, and on the balanced ship took off[11] the sails, and stowed them, and moored her in, and themselves landed.[12] Telemachos stepped out of the ship, but Athene went first,[13] and it was the gray-eyed goddess Athene who first spoke to him:[14] “Telemachos, here is no more need at all of modesty;[15] for this was why you sailed on the open sea, to find news[16] of your father, what soil covers him, what fate he has met with.[17] So come now, go straight up to Nestor, breaker of horses,[18] for we know what intelligence is hidden inside him.[19] You yourself must entreat him to speak the whole truth to you.[20] He will not tell you any falsehood; he is too thoughtful.”[21] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[22] “Mentor, how shall I go up to him, how close with him?[23] I have no experience in close discourse. There is[24] embarrassment for a young man who must question his elder.”[25] Then in turn the gray-eyed goddess Athene answered him:[26] “Telemachos, some of it you yourself will see in your own heart,[27] and some the divinity will put in your mind. I do not[28] think you could have been born and reared without the gods’ will.”[29] So spoke Pallas Athene, and she led the way swiftly,[30] and the man followed behind her walking in the god’s footsteps.[31] They came to where the men of Pylos were gathered in session,[32] where Nestor was sitting with his sons, and companions about him[33] were arranging the feast, and roasting the meat, and spitting more portions.[34] These men, when they sighted the strangers, all came down together[35] and gave them greeting with their hands and offered them places.[36] First Peisistratos, son of Nestor, came close up to them[37] and took them both by the hands, and seated them at the feasting[38] on soft rugs of fleece there on the sand of the seashore[39] next to his brother Thrasymedes and next to his father.[40] He gave them portions of the vitals, and poured wine for them[41] in a golden cup, and spoke a word to both of them, pledging  p 325  [42] Pallas Athene, who is daughter of Zeus of the aegis:[43] “My guest, make your prayer now to the lord Poseidon,[44] for his is the festival you have come to on your arrival;[45] but when you have poured to him and prayed, according to custom,[46] then give this man also a cup of the sweet wine, so that[47] he too can pour, for I think he also will make his prayer[48] to the immortals. All men need the gods. But this one[49] is a younger man than you, and of the same age as I am.[50] This is why I am first giving you the golden goblet.”[51] So he spoke, and put in her hand the cup of sweet wine,[52] and Athene was happy at the thoughtfulness of a just man,[53] because it was to her he first gave the golden goblet.[54] Immediately she made her prayer to the lord Poseidon:[55] “Hear us, Poseidon, who circle the earth, and do not begrudge us[56] the accomplishment of all these actions for which we pray you.[57] First of all to Nestor and to his sons grant glory,[58] and then on all the rest of the Pylians besides confer[59] gracious recompense in return for this grand hecatomb,[60] and yet again grant that Telemachos and I go back[61] with that business done for which we came this way in our black ship.”[62] She spoke in prayer, but herself was bringing it all to completion.[63] Next she gave Telemachos the fine two-handled goblet,[64] and the dear son of Odysseus prayed in the way that she had.[65] When they had roasted and taken off the spits the outer[66] meats, dividing shares they held their communal high feast.[67] But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,[68] first to speak was the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:[69] “Now is a better time to interrogate our guests and ask[70] them who they are, now they have had the pleasure of eating.[71] Strangers, who are you? From where do you come sailing over the watery[72] ways? Is it on some business, or are you recklessly roving[73] as pirates do, when they sail on the salt sea and venture[74] their lives as they wander, bringing evil to alien people?”[75] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer,[76] taking courage, for Athene herself had put that courage[77] in his heart, so that he might ask after his absent father,[78] and so that among people he might win a good reputation:[79] “O Nestor, Neleus’ son, great glory of the Achaians,[80] you ask us where we come from. Therefore I will tell you.[81] We come from Ithaka under the mountain Neion. This is[82] a private matter, no public business, of which I tell you.[83] I follow the wide fame of my father, on the chance of hearing[84] of the great patient-hearted Odysseus, the man they say once[85] fought beside you and helped sack the city of the Trojans.[86] For we have been told about all the other men who once fought[87] the Trojans, how each one of them perished in sad destruction,[88] but the son of Kronos has made this man’s death one that none knows.[89] There is no man who can plainly tell us when he perished,[90] whether he was killed on the mainland by men embattled[91] or on the open sea in the billows of Amphitrite.[92] That is why I come to your knees now, in case you might wish[93] to tell me of his dismal destruction, whether you saw it  p 326  [94] perhaps with your own eyes, or heard the tale from another[95] who wandered too. His mother bore this man to be wretched.[96] Do not soften it because you pity me and are sorry[97] for me, but fairly tell me all that your eyes have witnessed.[98] I implore you, if ever noble Odysseus, my father,[99] ever undertook any word or work and fulfilled it[100] for you, in the land of the Trojans where you Achaians suffered,[101] tell me these things from your memory. And tell me the whole truth.”[102] In turn Nestor the Gerenian horseman answered him:[103] “Dear friend, since you remind me of sorrows which in that country[104] we endured, we sons of the Achaians valiant forever,[105] or all we endured in our ships on the misty face of the water[106] cruising after plunder wherever Achilleus led us,[107] or all we endured about the great city of the lord Priam[108] fighting; and all who were our best were killed in that place;[109] there Aias lies, a man of battles, there lies Achilleus,[110] there lies Patroklos, one who was like the gods for counsel,[111] and there lies my own beloved son, both strong and stately,[112] Antilochos, surpassingly swift to run, and a fighter;[113] and many besides these were the evils we suffered; what man[114] who was one of the mortal people could ever tell the whole of it,[115] not if you were to sit beside me five years, and six years,[116] and asked me about the evils the great Achaians endured there;[117] sooner you would be tired of it and go back to your country.[118] For nine years we fabricated evils against them, trying them[119] with every kind of stratagem, and at last the son of Kronos[120] finished it. Then there was no man who wanted to be set up[121] for cunning against great Odysseus; he far surpassed them[122] in every kind of stratagem; your father; if truly[123] you are his son; and wonder seizes me when I look on you.[124] For surely your words are like his words, nor would anyone[125] ever have thought that a younger man could speak so like him.[126] For while I and the great Odysseus were there together,[127] we never spoke against one another, neither in council[128] nor assembly, but forever one in mind and in thoughtful[129] planning, we worked out how things would go best for the Argives.[130] But after we had sacked the sheer citadel of Priam,[131] and were going away in our ships, and the god scattered the Achaians,[132] then Zeus in his mind devised a sorry homecoming[133] for the Argives, since not all were considerate nor righteous;[134] therefore many of them found a bad way home, because of[135] the ruinous anger of the Gray-eyed One, whose father is mighty.[136] It was she who made a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus.[137] When these two called all the Achaians into assembly,[138] wildly, and in no kind of order, as the sun was setting,[139] and the sons of the Achaians came in, heavy with drinking[140] wine, these two spoke forth. It was why they assembled the people.[141] At this time Menelaos was urging all the Achaians[142] to think upon going home over the sea’s wide ridges,[143] but this did not please Agamemnon at all; he wished rather[144] to hold the people there, and accomplish holy hecatombs[145] so as to soften Athene’s deadly anger, poor fool  p 327  [146] who had no thought in his mind that she would not listen to him.[147] The will of the everlasting gods is not turned suddenly.[148] So these two, after making exchange with hard words, stood up[149] to go, and the rest of the strong-greaved Achaians rushed out[150] with inhuman clamor, and two opposed counsels pleased them.[151] That night we slept there, pondering in our minds hard thoughts[152] against each other; Zeus was contriving pain of hardship.[153] At dawn, some of us hauled our ships down into the divine sea,[154] and loaded our possessions aboard, and the deep-girdled women.[155] But half the people were held back because they remained there[156] with Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, shepherd of the people.[157] We the other half went aboard and drove on, and the ships went[158] very fast, as a god flattened the sea full of monsters.[159] We came to Tenedos and made sacrifice to the immortals.[160] We were straining homeward; but Zeus, hard-hearted, was not yet devising[161] homecoming for us, but again inspired yet another quarrel.[162] Then some, who followed the lord Odysseus, the wise and resourceful,[163] turned about, and boarding once more their oarswept vessels[164] went back, bringing comfort to Atreus’ son, Agamemnon.[165] But I, with all the ships that followed pulled together,[166] fled away, for I saw how the god was devising evils,[167] and the warlike son of Tydeus fled and urged his companions[168] on, and, late, fair-haired Menelaos came to join us[169] and caught us at Lesbos as we pondered our long sea-voyage,[170] whether we should sail over the top of rocky Chios[171] by the island Psyros, keeping it on our left hand, or else[172] to pass under Chios, by windy Mimas. We asked the god[173] to give us some portent for a sign, and the god gave us[174] one, and told us to cut across the middle main sea[175] for Euboia, and so most quickly escape the hovering evil.[176] A whistling wind rose up and began to blow and the ships ran[177] very fast across those ways full of fish, and at nighttime[178] brought us in at Geraistos. We sacrificed many thigh bones[179] of bulls to Poseidon, having measured the great open water.[180] It was the fourth day when the companions of Diomedes[181] breaker of horses, Tydeus’ son, made fast their balanced[182] ships at Argos. I held on for Pylos. Never once[183] did the wind fail, once the god had set it to blowing.[184] So, dear child, I came back, without news, and I knew nothing[185] of those other Achaians, which had survived, which ones had perished.[186] But all I have got by hearsay sitting here in my palace,[187] this you shall know; it is right you should; I will not conceal it.[188] They say that the Myrmidons, those furious spearmen led by[189] the glorious son of great-hearted Achilleus made a good voyage,[190] and Philoktetes, Poias’ shining son, had fair sailing,[191] and Idomeneus brought back to Crete all of his companions[192] who had escaped from the fighting. The sea took none of those men.[193] You yourselves, though you live apart, have heard of Atreides,[194] how he came home, and how Aigisthos devised his wretched[195] death; but Aigisthos too paid for it, in a dismal fashion;[196] so it is good, when a man has perished, to have a son left[197] after him, since this one took vengeance on his father’s killer,  p 328  [198] the treacherous Aigisthos, who cut down his glorious father.[199] So you too, dear friend, for I see you are tall and splendid,[200] be brave too, so that men unborn may speak well of you.”[201] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[202] “O Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,[203] it is all too true that he took revenge, and so the Achaians[204] will carry his glory far and wide, a theme for the singers[205] to come. If only the gods would give me such strength as he has[206] to take revenge on the suitors for their overbearing oppression.[207] They force their way upon me and recklessly plot against me.[208] No, the gods have spun out no such strand of prosperity[209] for me and my father. Now we must even have to endure it.”[210] Then in turn Nestor the Gerenian horseman answered him:[211] “Dear friend, since you have spoken about these things and reminded me,[212] they do say that many suitors for the sake of your mother[213] are in your palace against your will, and plot evil against you.[214] Tell me, are you willingly put down, or are the people[215] who live about you swayed by some divine voice, and hate you?[216] Who knows whether he will come someday and punish the violence[217] of these people, either by himself or all the Achaians with him?[218] If only gray-eyed Athene would deign to love you, as in[219] those days she used so to take care of glorious Odysseus[220] in the Trojan country, where we Achaians suffered miseries;[221] for I never saw the gods showing such open affection[222] as Pallas Athene, the way she stood beside him, openly;[223] if she would deign to love you as she did him, and care for you[224] in her heart, then some of those people might well forget about marrying.”[225] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[226] “Old sir, I think that what you have said will not be accomplished.[227] What you mean is too big. It bewilders me. That which I hope for[228] could never happen to me, not even if the gods so willed it.”[229] Now in turn the gray-eyed goddess Athene spoke to him:[230] “Telemachos, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[231] Lightly a god, if he wishes, can save a man, even from far off.[232] I myself would rather first have gone through many hardships[233] and then come home, and look upon my day of returning,[234] than come home and be killed at my own hearth, as Agamemnon[235] was killed, by the treacherous plot of his wife, and by Aigisthos.[236] But death is a thing that comes to all alike. Not even[237] the gods can fend it away from a man they love, when once[238] the destructive doom of leveling death has fastened upon him.”[239] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[240] “Mentor, though we sorrow let us speak no more of these things.[241] His homecoming is no longer a real thing, but already[242] the immortal gods must have contrived his death and black doom.[243] But now I would find out about another story, and question[244] Nestor, since the righteousness and thought in his mind outpass[245] others’, and they say he has been lord over three generations[246] of men. He shapes as an immortal for me to look upon.[247] O Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me the true story.[248] How did Atreus’ son, widely ruling Agamemnon,[249] die? And where was Menelaos? What scheme of death  p 329  [250] did treacherous Aigisthos have, to kill one far better than he was?[251] Was Menelaos out of Achaia and Argos, wandering[252] elsewhere among men, that Aigisthos had courage to do it?”[253] Then in turn Nestor the Gerenian horseman answered:[254] “So, my child, I will relate you the whole true story.[255] All would have happened just in the way you yourself have seen it,[256] if Atreus’ son, fair-haired Menelaos, on his homecoming[257] from Troy had found Aigisthos still alive in his palace.[258] Even after his death none would have heaped any earth upon him,[259] but he would have lain in the field outside the city, and the dogs[260] and birds would have feasted on him, nor would any Achaian woman[261] have wailed over him. That was a monstrous plot he accomplished.[262] For we were sitting out there and accomplishing many hard tasks[263] while he, at ease deep in the corner of horse-pasturing Argos,[264] kept talking to Agamemnon’s wife and trying to charm her.[265] Now in time before, beautiful Klytaimestra would not[266] consent to the act of shame, for her own nature was honest,[267] and also a man was there, a singer, whom Agamemnon,[268] when he went to Troy, had given many instructions to keep watch[269] on his wife; but when the doom of the gods had entangled her, so that[270] she must submit, Aigisthos took the singer and left him[271] on a desert island for the birds of prey to spoil and feed on,[272] and took her back to his house, and she was willing as he was.[273] Then on the sacred altars of the gods he burned many thigh bones[274] and hung up many dedications, gold, and things woven,[275] for having accomplished this monstrous thing he never had hoped for.[276] Now we sailed back on our way from Troy together, Atreus’[277] son, Menelaos, and I, with friendly thoughts toward each other,[278] but when we came to holy Sounion, the cape of Athens,[279] there Phoibos Apollo, with a visitation of his painless[280] arrows, killed the steersman of Menelaos, the one who[281] held in his hands the steering oar of the running ship. This was[282] Phrontis, Onetor’s son, who surpassed all the breed of mortals[283] in the steering of a ship whenever stormwinds were blowing.[284] So Menelaos, though straining for the journey, was detained[285] there, to bury his companion, and give him due rites.[286] But when he too had gone out on the wine-blue open water[287] in his hollow ships, and made his run as far as the steep rock[288] of Maleia, then Zeus of the wide brows devised that his journey[289] should be hateful, and poured out upon him the blast of shrilling[290] winds, and waves that bulged and grew monstrous, like mountains.[291] There he cut the fleet in two parts, and drove some on Crete[292] where the Kydonians lived around the streams of Iardanos.[293] There is the sheer of a cliff, a steep rock out in the water[294] at the other end of Gortys on the misty face of the main, where[295] the south wind piles up a huge surf on the left of the rock horn[296] toward Phaistos, and a little stone holds out the big water.[297] It was there they came, and by lively work the men avoided[298] destruction, but the waves smashed their ships on the splinters[299] of rock, but the wind and the water catching up the other[300] five dark-prowed ships bore them along and drove them on Egypt.[301] So Menelaos, gathering much gold and livelihood in those  p 330  [302] parts, sailed with his ships to men of alien language,[303] and all the while at home Aigisthos worked out his grim plans.[304] Seven years he lived as lord over golden Mykene,[305] after he killed Atreides, with the people subject beneath him,[306] but in the eighth the evil came on him, great Orestes[307] come home from Athens, and he killed his father’s murderer,[308] the treacherous Aigisthos, who had killed his glorious father.[309] When he had killed, he ordered among the Argives a grave mound[310] for his mother who was hateful and for unwarlike Aigisthos;[311] and on the same day Menelaos of the great war cry sailed in[312] bringing back many possessions, the burden his ships carried.[313] So, dear friend, do not you stay long and far wandering[314] away from home, leaving your possessions, and in your house men[315] so overbearing, for fear they divide up all your property[316] and eat it away, so all your journey will have no profit.[317] And yet I do encourage you and urge you to visit[318] Menelaos, for he is newly come from abroad, and people[319] who live where no man’s mind would ever have hope of returning,[320] once the stormwinds had blundered him off his course and into[321] an open sea that is so great that not the birds even[322] cross it by their strength, it is so big and terrible.[323] But go to him now, with your ship and with your companions,[324] or if you wish to go by land, here are horses and chariot,[325] and here are my own sons at your service, who will be your escorts[326] into shining Lakedaimon, the home of fair-haired Menelaos.[327] You yourself must entreat him to speak the whole truth to you.[328] He will not tell you any falsehood; he is too thoughtful.”[329] So he spoke, and the sun went down and the darkness came over,[330] and now the gray-eyed goddess Athene spoke forth before them:[331] “Old sir, all that you have said was fair and orderly.[332] But come now, cut out the tongues of the victims and mix the wine bowls,[333] so that when we have poured an offering to Poseidon[334] and the other immortals, we can think about sleep. It is that time.[335] For now the light has gone into the darkness, nor is it becoming[336] to sit about at the feast of the gods; but better to go home.”[337] So she spoke, the daughter of Zeus, and they listened to her.[338] The heralds poured water over their hands to wash with,[339] and the young men filled the mixing bowls with wine for their drinking,[340] and passed to all, after they had offered a drink in the goblets.[341] They threw the tongues in the fire and stood up and made a libation.[342] But when they had poured and drunk each as much as he wanted,[343] then Athene and godlike Telemachos started[344] up together to go away to their hollow vessel,[345] but Nestor detained them where they were, and made a speech to them:[346] “May Zeus and all the other immortals beside forfend[347] that you, in my domain, should go on back to your fast ship[348] as from some man altogether poor and without clothing,[349] who has not any abundance of blankets and rugs in his household[350] for his guests, or for himself to sleep in soft comfort.[351] But I do have abundance of fine rugs and blankets.[352] No, no, in my house the dear son of Odysseus shall not[353] have to go to sleep on the deck of a ship, as long as  p 331  [354] I am alive, and my sons after me are left in my palace[355] to entertain our guests, whoever comes to my household.”[356] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene said to him:[357] “This was well said by you, dear old sir; it is fitting[358] that Telemachos should obey you, since it is much better that way.[359] So he shall go along with you now, so that he can sleep[360] in your palace, but I shall be going down to my black ship,[361] so that I can encourage my companions and tell them everything.[362] For I am the only man among them who can call myself[363] an elder; the rest, all of an age with the great-hearted[364] Telemachos, are younger men who out of love for him[365] went along. There I will lie down beside the black ship[366] now, but at dawn shall make for the great-hearted Kaukones,[367] where a debt owed me has been piling up, it is not a new thing[368] nor a small one. You, since this young man has come to your household,[369] give him conveyance with your son by chariot, and give him[370] those horses that are best for strength and the lightest runners.”[371] So speaking, gray-eyed Athene went away in the likeness[372] of a vulture, and amazement seized on all the Achaians,[373] and the old man was amazed at what his eyes saw. He took[374] Telemachos by the hand and spoke a word to him and named him:[375] “Dear friend, I have no thought that you will turn out mean and cowardly[376] if, when you are so young, the gods go with you and guide you[377] thus. Here was no other of those who have their homes on Olympos[378] but the very daughter of Zeus, most honored Tritogeneia,[379] who always among the Argives favored your noble father.[380] So now, O queen, be gracious, and grant me good reputation[381] for myself and for my children also and for my grave wife,[382] and I will sacrifice you a yearling cow, with wide forehead,[383] unbroken, one no man has ever led under the yoke yet.[384] I will gild both her horns with gold and offer her to you.”[385] So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.[386] Now the Gerenian horseman Nestor led the way for[387] his sons and his sons-in-law back to his splendid dwelling.[388] But after they had reached the glorious dwelling of the king,[389] they took their places in order on chairs and along the benches,[390] and as they came in the old man mixed the wine bowl for them[391] with wine sweet to drink which the housekeeper had opened[392] in its eleventh year and loosed the sealing upon it.[393] The old man mixed the wine in the bowl and prayed much, pouring[394] a libation out to Athene daughter of Zeus of the aegis.[395] When they had poured and drunk, each man as much as he wanted,[396] they went away each one to sleep in his own dwelling,[397] but Nestor the Gerenian horseman gave Telemachos[398] the dear son of godlike Odysseus a place to sleep in[399] upon a corded bedstead in the echoing portico.[400] Next him was Peisistratos of the strong ash spear, leader[401] of men, who of his sons in the palace was still a bachelor.[402] But Nestor himself slept in the inner room of the high house,[403] and at his side the lady his wife served as bedfellow.[404] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[405] then Nestor the Gerenian horseman rose up from his bed,  p 332  [406] and went outside and took his seat upon the polished stones[407] which were there in place for him in front of the towering doorway,[408] white stones, with a shine on them that glistened. On these before him[409] Neleus, a counselor like the gods, had held his sessions,[410] but he had been beaten down by his doom and gone down to Hades’[411] house, and now Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians’ watcher,[412] sat there holding his staff, and his sons coming out of their chambers[413] gathered in a cluster about him, Echephron and Stratios,[414] Perseus and Aretos and Thrasymedes the godlike,[415] and sixth was the hero Peisistratos who came to join them.[416] They brought out godlike Telemachos and seated him next them,[417] and Nestor the Gerenian horseman began speaking to them:[418] “Act quickly now, dear children, and do me this favor, so that[419] I may propitiate first of all the gods, Athene,[420] who came plainly to me at our happy feasting in the god’s honor.[421] Come then, let one man go to the field for a cow, so that[422] she may come with all speed, and let one of the oxherds be driving her,[423] and one go down to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachos,[424] and bring back all his companions, leaving only two beside her,[425] and yet another go tell the worker in gold Laerkes[426] to come, so that he can cover the cow’s horns with gold. You others[427] stay here all together in a group but tell the serving[428] women who are in the house to prepare a glorious dinner,[429] and set chairs and firewood in readiness, and fetch bright water.”[430] So he spoke, and they all bustled about. The cow came[431] in from the field, and the companions of great-hearted Telemachos[432] came from beside their fast black ship, and the smith came, holding[433] in his hands the tools for forging bronze, his handicraft’s symbols,[434] the anvil and the sledgehammer and the well-wrought pincers[435] with which he used to work the gold, and Athene also[436] came to be at her rites. Now Nestor, the aged horseman,[437] gave the smith the gold, and he gilded the cow’s horns with it[438] carefully, so the god might take pleasure seeing her offering.[439] Stratios and the noble Echephron led the cow by[440] the horns, and Aretos came from the inner chamber carrying[441] lustral water in a flowered bowl, and in the other hand[442] scattering barley in a basket. Steadfast Thrasymedes[443] stood by with the sharp ax in his hand, to strike down the heifer.[444] Perseus held the dish for the blood, and the aged horseman[445] Nestor began with the water and barley, making long prayers[446] to Athene, in dedication, and threw the head hairs in the fire.[447] Now when all had made prayer and flung down the scattering barley,[448] Thrasymedes, the high-hearted son of Nestor, standing[449] close up, struck, and the ax chopped its way through the tendons[450] of the neck and unstrung the strength of the cow, and now the daughters[451] and daughters-in-law of Nestor and his grave wife Eurydike,[452] eldest of the daughters of Klymenos, raised the outcry.[453] They lifted the cow from earth of the wide ways, and held her[454] fast in place, and Peisistratos, leader of men, slaughtered her.[455] Now when the black blood had run out, and the spirit went from[456] the bones, they divided her into parts, and cut out the thigh bones[457] all according to due order, and wrapped them in fat,  p 333  [458] making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh upon them.[459] The old man burned these on cleft sticks, and poured the gleaming[460] wine over, while the young men with forks in their hands stood about him.[461] But when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals,[462] they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them,[463] and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.[464] Meanwhile lovely Polykaste, who was the youngest[465] of the daughters of Nestor, son of Neleus, had bathed Telemachos.[466] But when she had bathed him and anointed him sleekly with olive oil,[467] she threw a splendid mantle and a tunic about him,[468] and he came out from the bath looking like an immortal[469] and came and sat down beside Nestor, shepherd of the people.[470] When they had roasted and taken off the spits the outer[471] meats, they dined where they were sitting, and men of quality[472] started up and poured them wine in the golden goblets.[473] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[474] Nestor the Gerenian horseman began speaking to them:[475] “Come now, my children, harness the bright-maned horses under[476] the yoke for Telemachos so that he can get on with his journey.”[477] So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him,[478] and quickly they harnessed the fast horses under the chariot,[479] and the woman who was housekeeper put bread and wine in,[480] and meats, such as kings whom the gods love feed on,[481] and Telemachos stepped up into the fair-wrought chariot,[482] and by him Peisistratos leader of men, the son of Nestor,[483] went up into the chariot, and in his hands took the reins[484] and whipped the horses to run, and they winged their way unreluctant[485] into the plain, and left behind the sheer city of Pylos.[486] All day long they shook the yoke they wore on their shoulders.[487] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.[488] They came to Pherai and reached the house of Diokles, who was[489] son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios once had childed.[490] There they slept the night and he gave them hospitality.[491] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[492] they yoked the horses again and mounted the chariots bright with[493] bronze, and drove them out the front door and the echoing portico,[494] and he whipped them into a run and they winged their way unreluctant.[495] They came into the plain full of wheat, and by that way[496] made good their journey as their fast horses took this by-way.[497] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.book four[1] They came into the cavernous hollow of Lakedaimon[2] and made their way to the house of glorious Menelaos.[3] They found him in his own house giving, for many townsmen,[4] a wedding feast for his son and his stately daughter. The girl[5] he was sending to the son of Achilleus, breaker of battalions,[6] for in Troy land first he had nodded his head to it and promised[7] to give her, and now the gods were bringing to pass their marriage;[8] so he was sending her on her way, with horses and chariots,  p 334  [9] to the famous city of the Myrmidons, where Neoptolemos[10] was lord, and he brought Alektor’s daughter from Sparta, to give[11] powerful Megapenthes, his young grown son born to him[12] by a slave woman; but the gods gave no more children to Helen[13] once she had borne her first and only child, the lovely[14] Hermione, with the beauty of Aphrodite the golden.[15] So these neighbors and townsmen of glorious Menelaos[16] were at their feasting all about the great house with the high roof,[17] and taking their ease, and among them stepped an inspired singer[18] playing his lyre, while among the dancers two acrobats[19] led the measures of song and dance, revolving among them.[20] These two now, the hero Telemachos and the shining[21] son of Nestor in the forecourt, themselves and their horses,[22] stood, while powerful Eteoneus, who was the active[23] henchman of glorious Menelaos, came forward and saw them[24] and went with his message through the house to the shepherd of the people.[25] He came and standing close beside him addressed him in winged words:[26] “Menelaos, dear to Zeus, here are certain strangers,[27] two men, and they look like the breed of great Zeus. Tell me[28] then, whether we should unharness their fast horses,[29] or send them on to somebody else, who can entertain them.”[30] Then, deeply vexed, fair-haired Menelaos answered him:[31] “Eteoneus, son of Boëthoös, you were never[32] a fool before, but now you are babbling nonsense, as a child[33] would do. Surely we two have eaten much hospitality[34] from other men before we came back here. May Zeus only[35] make an end of such misery hereafter. Unharness[36] the strangers’ horses then, and bring the men here to be feasted.”[37] So he spoke, and the man hurried through the hall, bestirring[38] the other active henchmen to come on the way along with him.[39] They set free the sweating horses from under the harness,[40] and tethered them fast by the reins in front of the horse mangers,[41] and put down fodder before them and mixed white millet into it,[42] and leaned the chariots up against the glittering inner walls,[43] and led the men inside the divine house. These marveled[44] as they admired the palace of the king whom Zeus loved,[45] for as the shining of the sun or the moon was the shining[46] all through this high-roofed house of glorious Menelaos.[47] When with their eyes they had had their pleasure in admiration,[48] they stepped into the bathtubs smooth-polished and bathed there.[49] Then when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil,[50] and put cloaks of thick fleece and tunics upon them, they went[51] and sat on chairs beside Menelaos the son of Atreus.[52] A maidservant brought water for them and poured it from a splendid[53] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin[54] for them to wash, and she pulled a polished table before them.[55] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to them,[56] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions,[57] while a carver lifted platters of all kinds of meat and set them[58] in front of them, and placed beside them the golden goblets.[59] Then in greeting fair-haired Menelaos said to them:[60] “Help yourselves to the food and welcome, and then afterward,  p 335  [61] when you have tasted dinner, we shall ask you who among[62] men you are, for the stock of your parents can be no lost one,[63] but you are of the race of men who are kings, whom Zeus sustains,[64] who bear scepters; no mean men could have sons such as you are.”[65] So he spoke, and taking in his hands the fat beef loin[66] which had been given as his choice portion, he set it before them.[67] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[68] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[69] then Telemachos talked to the son of Nestor, leaning[70] his head close to his, so that none of the others might hear him:[71] “Son of Nestor, you who delight my heart, only look at[72] the gleaming of the bronze all through these echoing mansions,[73] and the gleaming of gold and amber, of silver and of ivory.[74] The court of Zeus on Olympos must be like this on the inside,[75] such abundance of everything. Wonder takes me as I look on it.”[76] Menelaos of the fair hair overheard him speaking,[77] and now he spoke to both of them and addressed them in winged words:[78] “Dear children, there is no mortal who could rival Zeus, seeing[79] that his mansions are immortal and his possessions. There may be[80] some man who could rival me for property, or there may be[81] none. Much did I suffer and wandered much before bringing[82] all this home in my ships when I came back in the eighth year.[83] I wandered to Cyprus and Phoenicia, to the Egyptians,[84] I reached the Aithiopians, Eremboi, Sidonians,[85] and Libya where the rams grow their horns quickly. Three times[86] in the fulfillment of a year their sheepflocks give birth,[87] and there no lord would ever go wanting, nor would his shepherd,[88] for cheese or meat, nor for the sweet milk either, but always[89] the sheep yield a continuous supply for their sucklings.[90] But while I was wandering those parts and bringing together[91] much property, meanwhile another man killed my brother[92] secretly, by surprise and by his cursed wife’s treachery.[93] So it is with no pleasure I am lord over all these possessions.[94] You will have heard all this from your fathers, whoever your fathers[95] are, for I have suffered much, and destroyed a household[96] that was very strongly settled and held many goods within it.[97] I wish I lived in my house with only a third part of all[98] these goods, and that the men were alive who died in those days[99] in wide Troy land far away from horse-pasturing Argos.[100] Still and again lamenting all these men and sorrowing[101] many a time when I am sitting here in our palace[102] I will indulge my heart in sorrow, and then another time[103] give over, for surfeit of gloomy lamentation comes quickly.[104] But for none of all these, sorry as I am, do I grieve so much[105] as for one, who makes hateful for me my food and my sleep, when I[106] remember, since no one of the Achaians labored as much[107] as Odysseus labored and achieved, and for him the end was[108] grief for him, and for me a sorrow that is never forgotten[109] for his sake, how he is gone so long, and we knew nothing[110] of whether he is alive or dead. The aged Laertes[111] and temperate Penelope must surely be grieving for him,[112] with Telemachos whom he left behind in his house, a young child.”  p 336  [113] He spoke, and stirred in the other the longing to weep for his father,[114] and the tears fell from his eyes to the ground when he heard his father’s[115] name, holding with both hands the robe that was stained with purple[116] up before his eyes. And Menelaos perceived it,[117] and now he pondered two ways within, in mind and in spirit[118] whether he would leave it to him to name his father,[119] or whether he should speak first and ask and inquire about everything.[120] While he was pondering these things in his heart and his spirit,[121] Helen came out of her fragrant high-roofed bedchamber,[122] looking like Artemis of the golden distaff. Adreste[123] followed and set the well-made chair in place for her,[124] and the coverlet of soft wool was carried in by Alkippe,[125] and Phylo brought the silver workbasket which had been given[126] by Alkandre, the wife of Polybos, who lived in Egyptian[127] Thebes, where the greatest number of goods are stored in the houses.[128] Polybos himself gave Menelaos two silver bathtubs,[129] and a pair of tripods, and ten talents of gold, and apart from[130] these his wife gave her own beautiful gifts to Helen.[131] She gave her a golden distaff and a basket, silver,[132] with wheels underneath, and the edges were done in gold. Phylo,[133] her maidservant, now brought it in and set it beside her[134] full of yarn that had been prepared for spinning. The distaff[135] with the dark-colored wool was laid over the basket. Helen[136] seated herself on the chair, and under her feet was a footstool.[137] At once she spoke to her husband and questioned him about everything:[138] “Do we know, Menelaos beloved of Zeus, who these men[139] announce themselves as being, who have come into our house now?[140] Shall I be wrong, or am I speaking the truth? My heart tells me[141] to speak, for I think I never saw such a likeness, neither[142] in man nor woman, and wonder takes me as I look on him,[143] as this man has a likeness to the son of great-hearted Odysseus,[144] Telemachos, who was left behind in his house, a young child[145] by that man when, for the sake of shameless me, the Achaians[146] went beneath Troy, their hearts intent upon reckless warfare.”[147] Then in answer fair-haired Menelaos said to her:[148] “I also see it thus, my wife, the way you compare them,[149] for Odysseus’ feet were like this man’s, his hands were like this,[150] and the glances of his eyes and his head and the hair growing.[151] Now too I was remembering things about Odysseus[152] and spoke of him, what misery he had in his hard work[153] for me; and he let fall a heavy tear from under his eyelids,[154] holding before his eyes the robe that was stained with purple.”[155] Now Peisistratos son of Nestor spoke up before him:[156] “Great Menelaos, son of Atreus, leader of the people,[157] this is in truth the son of that man, just as you are saying;[158] but he is modest, and his spirit would be shocked at the thought[159] of coming here and beginning a show of reckless language[160] in front of you, for we both delight in your voice, as if a god[161] were speaking. The Gerenian horseman Nestor sent me[162] to go along with him and escort him. He longed to see you[163] so that you could advise him somewhat, for word or action.[164] For a child endures many griefs in his house when his father  p 337  [165] is gone away, and no others are there to help him, as now[166] Telemachos’ father is gone away, and there are no others[167] who can defend him against the evil that is in his country.”[168] Then in answer fair-haired Menelaos said to him:[169] “See now, this is the son of a man greatly beloved who has come now[170] into my house, one who for my sake endured many trials,[171] and I thought he would come, and I would love him beyond all other[172] Argives, if only Olympian Zeus of the wide brows granted[173] both of us to come home across the sea in our fast ships.[174] I would have settled a city in Argos for him, and made him[175] a home, bringing him from Ithaka with all his possessions,[176] his son, all his people. I would have emptied one city for him[177] out of those that are settled round about and under my lordship.[178] And, both here, we would have seen much of each other; nothing[179] would then have separated us two in our friendship and pleasure,[180] until the darkening cloud of death had shrouded us over.[181] All this must be what the very god himself begrudged him,[182] who made only him an unhappy man, without a homecoming.”[183] He spoke, and started in all of them the desire for weeping.[184] Helen of Argos, daughter of Zeus, wept, so too Telemachos[185] wept, as did Menelaos the son of Atreus, nor did[186] Nestor’s son, Peisistratos, have eyes altogether tearless,[187] for he was thinking in his heart of stately Antilochos,[188] one whom the glorious son of the shining Dawn had cut down.[189] It was of him he thought as he addressed them in winged words:[190] “Son of Atreus, the aged Nestor used to say you were[191] thoughtful, surpassing other men, when we spoke about you[192] there in his own palace, and when we questioned each other.[193] So now, if it may be, would you do me a favor? For my part[194] I have no joy in tears after dinnertime. There will always[195] be a new dawn tomorrow. Yet I can have no objection[196] to tears for any mortal who dies and goes to his destiny.[197] And this is the only consolation we wretched mortals[198] can give, to cut our hair and let the tears roll down our faces.[199] For I myself had a brother who died, he was not the meanest[200] of the Argives, and you would have known him, but I for my part[201] never met nor saw him. They say he surpassed all others:[202] Antilochos: surpassingly swift of foot, and a fighter.”[203] Then in answer fair-haired Menelaos said to him:[204] “Dear friend, since you have said all that a man who is thoughtful[205] could say or do, even one who was older than you are—[206] why, this is the way your father is, so you too speak thoughtfully.[207] Easily recognized is the line of that man, for whom Kronos’[208] son weaves good fortune in his marrying and begetting,[209] as now he has given to Nestor, all his days, for himself[210] to grow old prosperously in his own palace, and also[211] that his sons should be clever and excellent in the spear’s work.[212] Now we shall let the weeping be, that came to us just now,[213] and let us think again about dinner, let someone pour us[214] water for our hands, and there will be time for words tomorrow[215] at dawn, for Telemachos and me, to talk with each other.”[216] He spoke, and Asphalion, who was the active henchman  p 338  [217] of glorious Menelaos, poured water for them to wash with.[218] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[219] Now Helen, who was descended of Zeus, thought of the next thing.[220] Into the wine of which they were drinking she cast a medicine[221] of heartsease, free of gall, to make one forget all sorrows,[222] and whoever had drunk it down once it had been mixed in the wine bowl,[223] for the day that he drank it would have no tear roll down his face,[224] not if his mother died and his father died, not if men[225] murdered a brother or a beloved son in his presence[226] with the bronze, and he with his own eyes saw it. Such were[227] the subtle medicines Zeus’ daughter had in her possessions,[228] good things, and given to her by the wife of Thon, Polydamna[229] of Egypt, where the fertile earth produces the greatest number[230] of medicines, many good in mixture, many malignant,[231] and every man is a doctor there and more understanding[232] than men elsewhere. These people are of the race of Paiëon.[233] Now when she had put the medicine in, and told them to pour it,[234] taking up the story again she began to speak to them:[235] “Son of Atreus, dear to Zeus, Menelaos: and you who[236] are here, children of noble fathers; yet divine Zeus sometimes[237] gives out good, or sometimes evil; he can do anything.[238] Sit here now in the palace and take your dinner and listen[239] to me and be entertained. What I will tell you is plausible.[240] I could not tell you all the number nor could I name them,[241] all that make up the exploits of enduring Odysseus,[242] but here is a task such as that strong man endured and accomplished[243] in the Trojan country where you Achaians suffered miseries.[244] He flagellated himself with degrading strokes, then threw on[245] a worthless sheet about his shoulders. He looked like a servant.[246] So he crept into the wide-wayed city of the men he was fighting,[247] disguising himself in the likeness of somebody else, a beggar,[248] one who was unlike himself beside the ships of the Achaians,[249] but in his likeness crept into the Trojans’ city, and they all[250] were taken in. I alone recognized him even in this form,[251] and I questioned him, but he in his craftiness eluded me;[252] but after I had bathed him and anointed him with olive oil[253] and put some clothing upon him, after I had sworn a great oath[254] not to disclose before the Trojans that this was Odysseus[255] until he had made his way back to the fast ships and the shelters,[256] then at last he told me all the purpose of the Achaians,[257] and after striking many Trojans down with the thin bronze[258] edge, he went back to the Argives and brought back much information.[259] The rest of the Trojan women cried out shrill, but my heart[260] was happy, my heart had changed by now and was for going back[261] home again, and I grieved for the madness that Aphrodite[262] bestowed when she led me there away from my own dear country,[263] forsaking my own daughter, my bedchamber, and my husband,[264] a man who lacked no endowment either of brains or beauty.”[265] Then in answer fair-haired Menelaos said to her:[266] “Yes, my wife, all this that you said is fair and orderly.[267] In my time I have studied the wit and counsel of many[268] men who were heroes, and I have been over much of the world, yet  p 339  [269] nowhere have I seen with my own eyes anyone like him,[270] nor known an inward heart like the heart of enduring Odysseus.[271] Here is the way that strong man acted and the way he endured[272] action, inside the wooden horse, where we who were greatest[273] of the Argives all were sitting and bringing death and destruction[274] to the Trojans. Then you came there, Helen; you will have been moved by[275] some divine spirit who wished to grant glory to the Trojans,[276] and Deïphobos, a godlike man, was with you when you came.[277] Three times you walked around the hollow ambush, feeling it,[278] and you called out, naming them by name, to the best of the Danaans,[279] and made your voice sound like the voice of the wife of each of the Argives.[280] Now I myself and the son of Tydeus and great Odysseus[281] were sitting there in the middle of them and we heard you crying[282] aloud, and Diomedes and I started up, both minded[283] to go outside, or else to answer your voice from inside,[284] but Odysseus pulled us back and held us, for all our eagerness.[285] Then all the other sons of the Achaians were silent:[286] there was only one, it was Antiklos, who was ready to answer,[287] but Odysseus, brutally squeezing his mouth in the clutch of his powerful[288] hands, held him, and so saved the lives of all the Achaians[289] until such time as Pallas Athene led you off from us.”[290] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[291] “Great Menelaos, son of Atreus, leader of the people:[292] so much the worse; for none of all this kept dismal destruction[293] from him, not even if he had a heart of iron within him.[294] But come, take us away to our beds, so that at last now[295] we can go to bed and enjoy the pleasure of sweet sleep.”[296] So he spoke, and Helen of Argos told her serving maids[297] to make up beds in the porch’s shelter and to lay upon them[298] fine underbedding of purple, and spread blankets above it[299] and fleecy robes to be an over-all covering. The maidservants[300] went forth from the main house, and in their hands held torches,[301] and they made the beds. The guests were led outside by a herald.[302] So the hero Telemachos and the glorious son of Nestor[303] slept in the place outside the house in the porch’s shelter,[304] but the son of Atreus slept in the inner room of the high house,[305] and by him lay Helen of the light robes, shining among women.[306] Now when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[307] Menelaos of the great war cry rose from where he was sleeping[308] and put on his clothes, and slung a sharp sword over his shoulder.[309] Underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals[310] and went on his way from the chamber, like a god in presence,[311] and sat down by Telemachos and spoke to him and named him:[312] “What is the need that has brought you here, O hero Telemachos,[313] to shining Lakedaimon over the sea’s wide ridges?[314] A public or a private matter? Tell me this truly.”[315] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[316] “Great Menelaos, son of Atreus, leader of the people,[317] I have come to see if you could tell me some news of my father,[318] for my home is being eaten away, the rich fields are ruined,[319] and the house is full of hateful men, who now forever[320] slaughter my crowding sheep and lumbering horn-curved cattle,  p 340  [321] these suitors of my mother, overbearing in their rapacity.[322] That is why I come to your knees now, in case you might wish[323] to tell me of his dismal destruction, whether you saw it[324] perhaps with your own eyes, or heard the tale from another[325] who wandered too. His mother bore this man to be wretched.[326] Do not soften it because you pity me and are sorry[327] for me, but fairly tell me all that your eyes have witnessed.[328] I implore you, if ever noble Odysseus, my father,[329] undertook any kind of word or work and fulfilled it[330] for you, in the land of the Trojans where all you Achaians suffered,[331] tell me these things from your memory. And tell me the whole truth.”[332] Then deeply angered fair-haired Menelaos said to him:[333] “Oh, for shame, it was in the bed of a bold and strong man[334] they wished to lie, they themselves being all unwarlike.[335] As when a doe has brought her fawns to the lair of a lion[336] and put them there to sleep, they are newborn and still suckling,[337] then wanders out into the foothills and the grassy corners,[338] grazing there, but now the lion comes back to his own lair[339] and visits a shameful destruction on both mother and children;[340] so Odysseus will visit shameful destruction on these men.[341] O father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, I wish that[342] as he was when upon a time in strong-founded Lesbos[343] he stood up and wrestled Philomeleides from a challenge[344] and threw him strongly, so delighting all the Achaians,[345] I wish that such an Odysseus would come now among the suitors.[346] They all would find death was quick and marriage a painful matter.[347] But for what you entreat me for and ask me about, I will not[348] turn away from the tale and speak idly, nor will I deceive you,[349] but of what the ever-truthful Old Man of the Sea told me[350] I will tell all without concealment, and hold back nothing.[351] “The gods held me still in Egypt when I was eager to come back[352] here, for I had not rendered complete hecatombs to them.[353] The gods have always desired that their orders should be listened to.[354] There is an island there in the heavy wash of the open[355] sea, in front of Egypt, and they call it Pharos, as far out[356] as the distance a hollow ship can make in a whole day’s sailing[357] when a sharp and following wind is blowing it onward.[358] And there is a harbor there with good anchorage, whence they put forth[359] their balanced ships to sea, after they have drawn dark water.[360] There the gods held me twenty days, nor did the sea winds[361] ever appear and blow across the salt water, such winds[362] as act to send ships sailing over the sea’s wide ridges.[363] And now the food would all have been gone, and the men’s strength with it,[364] if one of the gods had not been sorry for me, and shown mercy,[365] Eidothea, daughter to mighty Proteus, the Old Man[366] of the Sea, for it was her heart that I moved mostly[367] when she met me wandering by myself without my companions.[368] For always ranging about the island they would go fishing[369] with crooked fishhooks, and always the hunger oppressed their bellies.[370] She came and stood close beside me and spoke a word and addressed me:[371] ‘Are you so simple then, O stranger, and flimsy-minded,[372] or are you willingly giving up, and enjoying your hardships?  p 341  [373] See, you are held so long on the island, and can find no way[374] out of it, while the heart in your companions diminishes.’[375] So she spoke, and I in turn spoke up and made answer:[376] ‘So I will tell, whoever you may be of the goddesses,[377] that I am not detained of my own free will, but it must be[378] I have offended the immortals who hold wide heaven.[379] But do you then tell me, for the gods know everything, which one[380] of the immortals hampers me here and keeps me from my journey[381] and tell me how to make my way home on the sea where the fish swarm.’[382] So I spoke, and she, shining among the goddesses, answered:[383] ‘See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[384] The ever truthful Old Man of the Sea ranges in these parts.[385] This is the Egyptian, immortal Proteus, and he knows[386] all the depths of the sea. He is Poseidon’s underthegn.[387] And they say also he is my father, that he begot me.[388] If somehow you could lie in ambush and catch hold of him,[389] he could tell you the way to go, the stages of your journey,[390] and tell you how to make your way home on the sea where the fish swarm.[391] And he could tell you too, illustrious one, if you wish it,[392] what evil and what good has been done in your palace[393] while you have been gone away on your long and arduous voyage.’[394] So she spoke, but then I answered her and said to her:[395] ‘Show me the way to lie in wait for this divine ancient,[396] for fear he may somehow see me first and be warned and avoid me.[397] A god is difficult for a mortal man to master.’[398] So I spoke, and she, shining among goddesses, answered:[399] ‘See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[400] At the time when the sun has gone up to bestride the middle of heaven,[401] then the ever-truthful Old Man of the Sea will come out of the water[402] under the blast of the West Wind, circled in a shudder of darkening[403] water, and when he comes out he will sleep, under hollow caverns,[404] and around him seals, those darlings of the sea’s lovely lady,[405] sleep in a huddle, after they have emerged from the gray sea,[406] giving off the sour smell that comes from the deep salt water.[407] There I will take you myself when dawn shows and arrange you[408] orderly in your ambush; you must choose from your companions[409] those three who are your best beside your strong-benched vessels.[410] Now I will tell you all the devious ways of this old man.[411] First of all he will go among his seals and count them,[412] but after he has reviewed them all and noted their number,[413] he will lie down in their midst, like a herdsman among his sheepflocks.[414] Next, as soon as you see that he is asleep, that will be[415] the time for all of you to use your strength and your vigor,[416] and hold him there while he strives and struggles hard to escape you.[417] And he will try you by taking the form of all creatures that come forth[418] and move on the earth, he will be water and magical fire.[419] You must hold stiffly on to him and squeeze him the harder.[420] But when at last he himself, speaking in words, questions you,[421] being now in the same form he was in when you saw him sleeping,[422] then, hero, you must give over your force and let the old man[423] go free, and ask him which one of the gods is angry with you,[424] and ask him how to make your way home on the sea where the fish swarm.’  p 342  [425] So she spoke, and dived back into the surf of the water.[426] Then I went back again to our ships where they were stationed[427] along the sand, but my heart was a storm in me as I went. Now[428] when I had come back to where my ship lay by the seaside,[429] we made ready our dinner, and the immortal night came over,[430] and then we lay down to sleep along the break of the sea beach.[431] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[432] then I made my way along the beach of the wide-wayed[433] sea, praying much to the gods, and I took along with me[434] those three companions I trusted most for any adventure.[435] “Meanwhile she had dived down into the sea’s great cavern[436] and brought back the skins of four seals out of the water.[437] All were newly skinned. She was planning a trick on her father.[438] And hollowing out four beds in the sand of the sea, she sat there[439] waiting for us, and we came close up to her. Thereupon[440] she bedded us down in order, and spread a skin over each man.[441] That was a most awful ambush, for the pernicious[442] smell of those seals, bred in the salt water, oppressed us terribly.[443] Who would want to lie down to sleep by a sea-bred monster?[444] But she herself came to our rescue and devised a great help.[445] She brought ambrosia, and put it under the nose of each man,[446] and it smelled very sweet, and did away with the stench of the monster.[447] All that morning we waited there, with enduring spirit,[448] and the seals came crowding out of the sea, and when they came out[449] they lay down to sleep in order along the break of the sea beach.[450] At noon the Old Man came out of the sea and found his well-fed[451] seals, and went about to them all, and counted their number,[452] and we were among the first he counted; he had no idea[453] of any treachery. Then he too lay down among us.[454] We with a cry sprang up and rushed upon him, locking him[455] in our arms, but the Old Man did not forget the subtlety[456] of his arts. First he turned into a great bearded lion,[457] and then to a serpent, then to a leopard, then to a great boar,[458] and he turned into fluid water, to a tree with towering branches,[459] but we held stiffly on to him with enduring spirit.[460] But when the Old Man versed in devious ways grew weary[461] of all this, he spoke to me in words and questioned me:[462] ‘Which of the gods now, son of Atreus, has been advising you[463] to capture me from ambush against my will. What do you want?’[464] So he spoke, and I in turn spoke up and made answer:[465] ‘You know, Old Man. Why try to put me off with your answer?[466] See, I am held so long on the island, and can find no way[467] out of it, while the inward heart in me diminishes.[468] Do you then tell me, for the gods know everything, which one[469] of the immortals hampers me here and keeps me from my journey,[470] and tell me how to make my way home on the sea where the fish swarm.’[471] So I spoke, and he in turn spoke up and made answer:[472] ‘But you should have made grand sacrifices to Zeus and the other[473] immortal gods, and so gone on board, so most quickly[474] to reach your own country, sailing over the wine-blue water.[475] It is not your destiny now to see your own people and come back[476] to your strong-founded house and to the land of your fathers,  p 343  [477] until you have gone back once again to the water of Egypt,[478] the sky-fallen river, and there have accomplished holy hecatombs[479] in honor of all the immortal gods who hold wide heaven.[480] Then the gods will grant you that journey that you so long for.’[481] So he spoke, and the inward heart in me was broken[482] because he ordered me to go back on the misty surface[483] of the water to Egypt again, a long way and a hard one,[484] but even so I answered him in words and said to him:[485] ‘All these things I will do, Old Man, in the way you tell me.[486] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[487] Did all those Achaians Nestor and I left behind when we went[488] sailing from Troy come back in their ships, without injury,[489] or did any of them die by a dismal death on shipboard[490] or in the arms of his friends after he had wound up the fighting?’[491] So I spoke, and he in turn spoke up and made answer:[492] ‘Son of Atreus, why did you ask me that? You should not[493] learn it, nor know what my mind knows, and I think you will not be[494] free of tears for long, once you have heard the whole story.[495] There were many of these men who were lost, and many left over,[496] but two alone who were leaders of the bronze-armored Achaians[497] died on the way home. You yourself were there at the fighting.[498] And there is one who is being held alive on the wide sea[499] somewhere. Aias was lost, and his long-oared vessels with him.[500] First of all Poseidon drove him against the great rocks[501] of Gyrai, and yet he saved him out of the water,[502] and Aias would have escaped his doom, though Athene hated him,[503] had he not gone wildly mad and tossed out a word of defiance;[504] for he said that in despite of the gods he escaped the great gulf[505] of the sea, and Poseidon heard him, loudly vaunting,[506] and at once with his ponderous hands catching up the trident[507] he drove it against the Gyrean rock, and split a piece off it,[508] and part of it stayed where it was, but a splinter crashed in the water,[509] and this was where Aias had been perched when he raved so madly.[510] It carried him down to the depths of the endless and tossing main sea.[511] So Aias died, when he had swallowed down the salt water.[512] Your brother somehow got away and escaped the death spirits[513] with his hollow ships. It was the lady Hera who saved him.[514] But now as he had come close to the point of making the sheer peak[515] Maleia, then the stormwinds caught him away and carried him,[516] groaning heavily, out on the open sea where the fish swarm.[519] But since even from out there an easy homecoming was manifest[520] for him, the gods twisted the wind back, and they made the homeland[517] at the uttermost edge of his estate, where before now Thyestes[518] had made his home, but now Aigisthos son of Thyestes[521] lived. Agamemnon stepped rejoicing on the soil of his country[522] and stroked the ground with his hand and kissed it, and his thronging[523] hot tears streamed down, so dear to him was the sight of his country.[524] But a watchman saw him from his lookout, a man whom Aigisthos[525] had treacherously taken and stationed there, and promised him[526] two talents of gold as pay. For a year he had been watching[527] so Agamemnon would not go by unnoticed and mindful[528] of his furious valor. The man ran to the house of the war lord  p 344  [529] with his news, and at once Aigisthos devised a treacherous stratagem.[530] Choosing out the twenty best fighting men in the district,[531] he set an ambush, and beside it had them arrange a festival,[532] and went down to welcome Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,[533] with horses and chariots, and with shameful thoughts in his mind, then[534] led him in all unsuspicious of death, and feasted him[535] and killed him feasting, as one strikes down an ox at his manger.[536] Not one of Agamemnon’s men who followed him was left[537] alive, nor one of Aigisthos’ men. All were killed in the palace.’[538] So he spoke, and the inward heart in me was broken,[539] and I sat down on the sand and cried, nor did the heart in me[540] wish to go on living any longer nor to look on the sunlight.[541] But when I had glutted myself with rolling on the sand and weeping,[542] then the ever-truthful Old Man of the Sea said to me:[543] ‘No longer now, son of Atreus, spend your time on these wasting[544] tears, for I know no good that will come of it. Rather with all speed[545] endeavor to make good your way back to the land of your fathers.[546] You might find Aigisthos still alive, or perhaps Orestes[547] has beaten you to the kill, but you might be there for the burying.’[548] So he spoke, and the heart within me and the proud spirit[549] of the breast was softened, even though I was so sorrowful[550] and now I spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[551] ‘These then I know. But do you tell me the name of the third man,[552] whoever it is who is being held alive on the wide sea,[553] or else he has died, but for all my sorrow, I would hear this.’[554] So I spoke, and he in turn spoke up and made answer:[555] ‘That was Odysseus son of Laertes, who makes his home in[556] Ithaka, whom I saw on an island, weeping big tears[557] in the palace of the nymph Kalypso, and she detains him[558] by constraint, and he cannot make his way to his country,[559] for he has not any ships by him, nor any companions[560] who can convey him back across the sea’s wide ridges.[561] But for you, Menelaos, O fostered of Zeus, it is not the gods’ will[562] that you shall die and go to your end in horse-pasturing Argos,[563] but the immortals will convoy you to the Elysian[564] Field, and the limits of the earth, where fair-haired Rhadamanthys[565] is, and where there is made the easiest life for mortals,[566] for there is no snow, nor much winter there, nor is there ever[567] rain, but always the stream of the Ocean sends up breezes[568] of the West Wind blowing briskly for the refreshment of mortals.[569] This, because Helen is yours and you are son-in-law therefore[570] to Zeus.’ He spoke, and dived back into the tossing deep water.[571] But I went back again to my ships, and my godlike companions[572] went with me, but my heart was a storm in me as I went. Now[573] when we had come back to where our ship lay by the seaside,[574] we made ready our dinner, and the immortal night came over,[575] and then we lay down to sleep along the break of the sea beach.[576] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[577] first of all we dragged the ship down into the bright water,[578] and in the balanced ships set the masts in place, and set sails,[579] and we ourselves also went aboard and sat to the oarlocks,[580] and sitting well in order we dashed the oars in the gray sea,  p 345  [581] back to where Egypt is, the sky-fallen river, and there[582] I stranded my ships, and there I rendered complete hecatombs.[583] But when I had ended the anger of the gods, who are everlasting,[584] I piled a mound for Agamemnon, so that his memory[585] might never die. I did this, and set sail, and the immortals[586] gave me a wind, so brought me back to my own dear country[587] with all speed. Come, now, stay here with me in my palace[588] until it is the eleventh day and even the twelfth day,[589] and then I will send you well on your way, and give you glorious[590] gifts, three horses and a well-finished chariot; also[591] I will give you a fine goblet so that you can pour libations[592] to the immortals; and think of me, all your days, when you do so.”[593] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[594] “Son of Atreus, do not keep me with you here for a long time,[595] since I could well be satisfied to sit here beside you[596] for a year’s time, without any longing for home or parents,[597] such strange pleasure do I take listening to your stories[598] and sayings, but by now my companions in sacred Pylos[599] are growing restless, yet for some time you would keep me with you.[600] And let the gift you give me be something that can be stored up.[601] I will not take the horses to Ithaka, but will leave them[602] here, for your own delight, since you are lord of a spreading[603] plain, there is plenty of clover here, there is galingale,[604] and there is wheat and millet here and white barley, wide grown.[605] There are no wide courses in Ithaka, there is no meadow;[606] a place to feed goats; but lovelier than a place to feed horses;[607] for there is no one of the islands that has meadows for driving horses;[608] they are all sea slopes; and Ithaka more than all the others.”[609] He spoke, and Menelaos of the great war cry smiled on him,[610] and stroked him with his hand and called him by name and spoke to him:[611] “You are of true blood, dear child, in the way you reason.[612] So I shall change all this for you, since I am able to,[613] and of all those gifts that lie stored away in my house I will give you[614] the one which is most splendid and esteemed at the highest value.[615] I will give you a fashioned mixing bowl. It is of silver[616] all but the edges, and these are finished in gold. This is[617] the work of Hephaistos. The hero Phaidimos, the Sidonians’[618] king, gave it to me, when his house took me in and sheltered me[619] there on my way home. I would give it to you for a present.”[620] So these two remained conversing this way together,[621] and the banqueters came now into the divine king’s palace,[622] and they drove sheep and carried heartening wine, and with them[623] their wives, in handsome hoods, brought food along. In this way[624] they about the palace were busy preparing dinner;[625] but meanwhile before the palace of Odysseus the suitors[626] amused themselves with discs and with light spears for throwing[627] on a leveled floor, unruly men as they always had been,[628] but Antinoös and Eurymachos the godlike were seated[629] as lords of the suitors, out and away the best men among them,[630] and to them now came Phronios’ son Noëmon, approaching[631] Antinoös, and spoke to him and asked him a question:[632] “Antinoös, do we have an idea in our minds or do we  p 346  [633] not, when Telemachos will come back from sandy Pylos?[634] He has gone, and taken my ship, and now I find that I need her[635] for crossing over to spacious Elis, where I have a dozen[636] horses, mares, and suckling from them hard-working unbroken[637] mules; I would like to break one in, taking it from the others.”[638] So he spoke, and they were amazed at heart; they had not thought[639] he had gone to Pylos, the city of Neleus, but that he was somewhere[640] near, on his lands, among the flocks, or else with the swineherd.[641] It was Antinoös the son of Eupeithes that answered:[642] “Tell me the truth now, when did he go, and which of the young men[643] went with him? The choice men of Ithaka, or were they his own[644] following, henchmen and servants? Even he could accomplish so much.[645] And tell me this and tell me truly, so I can be certain,[646] did he take your black ship from you by force, when you were unwilling,[647] or did you willingly give it him, when he spoke to you for it?”[648] Then the son of Noëmon, Phronios, gave him an answer:[649] “I gave it to him of my free will. What else could one do[650] when a man like this, with so many cares to trouble his spirit,[651] asked for it? It would be hard to deny him the giving.[652] And the young men who are going along with him are the noblest[653] in our neighborhood. Also, I saw going aboard as leader[654] Mentor, or it was a god, but he was in every way like him,[655] and yet I wonder, for yesterday early I saw the splendid[656] Mentor here; before, he was boarding a ship for Pylos.”[657] So he spoke, and went away to the house of his father,[658] and the proud heart in both these suitors was filled with amazement.[659] They had the suitors sit down in a group and stopped their contests.[660] It was Antinoös the son of Eupeithes who spoke to them,[661] raging, the heart within filled black to the brim with anger[662] from beneath, but his two eyes showed like fire in their blazing:[663] “Here now is a monstrous thing, this voyage made by Telemachos,[664] and insolently put through. We thought he would never achieve it.[665] A young boy, in despite of so many of us, has hauled down[666] his ship, and gone away, choosing out the best men in the country.[667] The evil will begin to go further. May Zeus grant destruction[668] of the life in him, before he comes to full measure of manhood.[669] But come now, give me a fast ship and twenty companions,[670] so that I can watch his return and lie in wait for him[671] in the narrow strait between Ithaka and towering Samos,[672] and make him sorry for this sea-going in search of his father.”[673] So he spoke, and they all approved what he said and urged it,[674] and at once they stood up and went inside the house of Odysseus.[675] Nor did Penelope go for a long time without knowing[676] of the counsels which the suitors had been secretly planning,[677] for Medon the herald told her, having overheard their counsels.[678] He had been standing outside the court while they plotted inside it,[679] and he went on his way with the message into the house of Penelope.[680] Penelope spoke to him as he stepped over the threshold:[681] “Herald, on what errand have the proud suitors sent you?[682] Is it to tell the serving maids of godlike Odysseus[683] to stop their work, so as to prepare the suitors a dinner?[684] Could this not be the last and the latest time of their dining  p 347  [685] here, whether coming to court me or meeting for some other reason?[686] You, who keep gathering here, and consuming away much livelihood,[687] the property of wise Telemachos, nor have you listened[688] to what you heard from your fathers before you, when you were children,[689] what kind of man Odysseus was among your own parents,[690] how he did no act and spoke no word in his own country[691] that was unfair; and that is a way divine kings have, one[692] will be hateful to a certain man, and favor another,[693] but Odysseus was never outrageous at all to any man.[694] But in you the spirit is plain to see, and your unjust actions,[695] how you have no gratitude thereafter for good things done you.”[696] Medon in turn, a man of thoughtful mind, said to her:[697] “If only, my queen, that could be the worst of the evil.[698] But the suitors now are devising another thing that is much worse[699] and harder to bear. May the son of Kronos not see it accomplished.[700] Now they are minded to kill Telemachos with the sharp bronze[701] on his way home. He went in quest of news of his father[702] to Pylos the sacrosanct and to glorious Lakedaimon.”[703] So he spoke, and her knees gave way and the heart in her.[704] She stayed a long time without a word, speechless, and her eyes[705] filled with tears, the springing voice was held still within her.[706] At long last she found words to speak to him and answer:[707] “Herald, why is my child gone from me? There was no reason[708] for him to board fast-running ships, which serve as horses[709] for men on the salt sea, and they cross the expanses of water.[710] Must it be so that even his name shall be gone from men’s minds?”[711] Medon then, a thoughtful man, spoke to her in answer:[712] “I do not know whether some god moved him, or whether his own mind[713] had the impulse to go to Pylos, in order to find out[714] about his father’s homecoming, or what fate he had met with.”[715] So speaking he went away back into the house of Odysseus,[716] and a cloud of heart-wasting sorrow was on her, she had no strength left[717] to sit down in a chair, though there were many there in the palace,[718] but sat down on the floor of her own well-wrought bedchamber[719] weeping pitifully, and about her her maids were wailing[720] all, who were there in the house with her, both young and old ones.[721] To them weeping constantly Penelope spoke now:[722] “Hear me, dear friends. The Olympian has given me sorrows[723] beyond all others who were born and brought up together[724] with me, for first I lost a husband with the heart of a lion[725] and who among the Danaans surpassed in all virtues,[726] and great, whose fame goes wide through Hellas and midmost Argos;[727] and now again the stormwinds have caught away my beloved[728] son, without trace, from the halls, and I never heard when he left me.[729] Hard-hearted, not one out of all of you then remembered[730] to wake me out of my bed, though your minds knew all clearly,[731] when he went out and away to board the hollow black ship.[732] For if I had heard that he was considering this journey,[733] then he would have had to stay, though hastening to his voyage,[734] or he would have had to leave me dead in the halls. So now[735] let someone make her way quickly and summon the old man Dolios,[736] my own servant, whom my father gave me to have as I came here,  p 348  [737] and he keeps an orchard full of trees for me, so that he may[738] go with speed to Laertes and sit beside him and tell him[739] all, and perhaps he, weaving out the design in his heart,[740] may go outside and complain to the people of those who are striving[741] to waste away his own seed and that of godlike Odysseus.”[742] Then in turn Eurykleia her dear nurse said to her:[743] “Kill me then, dear girl, with the pitiless bronze, or else[744] let me be in the halls. I will not hide the story from you.[745] I did know all these things, and I gave him all that he asked for,[746] both bread and sweet wine, but he took a great oath from me[747] never to tell you of it until it came to the twelfth day,[748] or until you might miss him yourself or hear he was absent,[749] so that you might not ruin your lovely skin with weeping.[750] But go, wash with water and put clean clothing upon your body,[751] and going on to the upper story with your attendant[752] women, pray to Athene daughter of Zeus of the aegis,[753] for she would then be able to save him, even from dying.[754] But do not embitter the bitterness of the old man. I think[755] the seed of Arkeisios is not altogether hated[756] by the blessed gods, but there will still be one left to inherit[757] the high-roofed house and the rich fields that lie at a distance.”[758] So she spoke, and stilled her grieving and stopped the weeping[759] of her eyes, and she washed and put clean clothing upon her body;[760] and went to the upper story with her attendant women,[761] and laid the barley grains in the basket and prayed to Athene:[762] “Hear me, Atrytone, child of Zeus of the aegis,[763] if ever here in his own palace resourceful Odysseus[764] burned the rich thigh pieces of an ox or sheep in your honor,[765] remember it now for my sake and save for me my beloved[766] son, and fend off the suitors who are evilly overbearing.”[767] She spoke, and raised the outcry, and the goddess listened to her praying.[768] But the suitors all through the shadowy halls were raising a tumult,[769] and thus would go the word of one of the arrogant young men:[770] “Surely our much sought-after queen is consenting to marriage[771] with one of us, not knowing how the murder of her son is appointed.”[772] Thus one of them would speak, not knowing what was appointed.[773] But it was Antinoös who now stood forth and addressed them:[774] “You are all mad. Keep clear of all this kind of disorderly[775] talk, for fear somebody may go inside and report us.[776] But come let us silently rise up now and put into action[777] that counsel which has been resolved in the hearts of all of us.”[778] So he spoke, and chose out the twenty best men among them,[779] and they went along to the fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[780] and first of all they dragged the ship out to the deepening water,[781] and in the black hull set the mast in place, and set sails,[782] and made the oars fast in the leather slings of the oarlocks[783] all in good order, and hoisted the white sails and set them,[784] and their high-hearted henchmen carried their gear on for them.[785] They anchored her deep enough in the channel, and then disembarking[786] themselves, prepared their dinner and waited for the coming of evening.[787] But she in the upper chamber, circumspect Penelope,  p 349  [788] lay there fasting, she had tasted no food nor drink, only[789] pondering whether her stately son would escape from dying[790] or have to go down under the hands of the insolent suitors;[791] and as much as a lion caught in a crowd of men turns about[792] in fear, when they have made a treacherous circle about him,[793] so she was pondering, when the painless sleep came upon her[794] and all her joints were relaxed so that she slept there reclining.[795] Then the gray-eyed goddess Athene thought what to do next.[796] She made an image, and likened it to Penelope’s sister[797] Iphthime, the daughter of great-hearted Ikarios,[798] whose husband was Eumelos, and he lived in his home at Pherai.[799] She sent her now into the house of godlike Odysseus[800] in order to stop Penelope, who was grieving, lamenting,[801] from her crying and tearful lamentation. The dream figure[802] went into the bedchamber passing beside the thong of the door bar,[803] and came and stood above her head and spoke a word to her:[804] “Penelope, are you sleeping so sorrowful in the inward[805] heart? But the gods who live at their ease do not suffer you[806] to weep and to be troubled, since your son will have his homecoming[807] even yet, since he has done no wrong in the gods’ sight.”[808] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer,[809] sleeping very sweetly now in the dreams’ gateway:[810] “Why have you come here, sister, now, when you were not used to[811] come before, since the home where you live is far away from us,[812] and now you tell me to give over from the grieving and sorrows[813] that are many upon me and trouble me in my heart and spirit,[814] since first I lost a husband with the heart of a lion,[815] and who among the Danaans surpassed in all virtues,[816] a great man, whose fame goes wide through Hellas and midmost Argos;[817] and now again a beloved son is gone on a hollow[818] ship, an innocent all unversed in fighting and speaking,[819] and it is for him I grieve even more than for that other one,[820] and tremble for him and fear, lest something should happen to him[821] either in the country where he has gone, or on the wide sea,[822] for he has many who hate him and are contriving against him[823] and striving to kill him before he comes back into his own country.”[824] Then in turn the dark dream image spoke to her in answer:[825] “Take courage, let not your heart be too altogether frightened,[826] such an escort goes along with him, and one that other[827] men would have prayed to have standing beside them, for she has power,[828] Pallas Athene, and she has pity on you in your grieving,[829] and it is she who has sent me to you to tell you of these things.”[830] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[831] “If then you are a god, and have heard the voice of the goddess,[832] come then, tell me of that other unfortunate, tell me[833] whether he still lives and looks upon the sun’s shining,[834] or whether he has died and is now in the house of Hades.”[835] Then in turn the dark dream image spoke to her in answer:[836] “As for that other one, I will not tell you the whole story[837] whether he lives or has died. It is bad to babble emptily.”[838] So she spoke, and drifted away by the bolt and the door post  p 350  [839] and out and into the blowing winds. Ikarios’ daughter[840] started up from her sleep, soothed in the inward heart, because[841] this clear dream in the dim of the night had come to visit her.[842] But the suitors went aboard and sailed out into the flowing[843] ways, in their hearts devising sudden death for Telemachos.[844] There is a rocky island there in the middle channel[845] halfway between Ithaka and towering Samos,[846] called Asteris, not large, but it has a double anchorage[847] where ships can be hidden. There the Achaians waited in ambush.book five[1] Now Dawn rose from her bed, where she lay by haughty Tithonos,[2] carrying light to the immortal gods and to mortals,[3] and the gods came and took their places in session, and among them[4] Zeus who thunders on high, and it is his power that is greatest,[5] and Athene spoke to them of the many cares of Odysseus,[6] remembering. Though he was in the nymph’s house, she still thought of him:[7] “Father Zeus, and all other blessed gods everlasting,[8] no longer now let one who is a sceptered king be eager[9] to be gentle and kind, be one whose thought is schooled injustice,[10] but let him always rather be harsh, and act severely,[11] seeing the way no one of the people he was lord over[12] remembers godlike Odysseus, and he was kind, like a father.[13] But now he lies away on an island suffering strong pains[14] in the palace of the nymph Kalypso, and she detains him[15] by constraint, and he cannot make his way to his country,[16] for he has not any ships by him, nor any companions[17] who can convey him back across the sea’s wide ridges.[18] And now there are those who are determined to murder his dear son[19] on his way home. He went in quest of news of his father[20] to Pylos the sacrosanct and to glorious Lakedaimon.”[21] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:[22] “My child, what sort of word has escaped your teeth’s barrier?[23] For is not this your own intention, as you have counseled it,[24] how Odysseus shall make his way back, and punish those others?[25] Then bring Telemachos home skillfully, since you can do this,[26] so that all without harm he can come back to his own country[27] while the suitors in their ship come back with nothing accomplished.”[28] He spoke, and then spoke directly to his beloved son, Hermes:[29] “Hermes, since for other things also you are our messenger,[30] announce to the nymph with the lovely hair our absolute purpose:[31] the homecoming of enduring Odysseus, that he shall come back[32] by the convoy neither of the gods nor of mortal people,[33] but he shall sail on a jointed raft and, suffering hardships,[34] on the twentieth day make his landfall on fertile Scheria[35] at the country of the Phaiakians who are near the gods in origin,[36] and they will honor him in their hearts as a god, and send him[37] back, by ship, to the beloved land of his fathers,[38] bestowing bronze and gold in abundance upon him, and clothing,[39] more than Odysseus could ever have taken away from Troy, even  p 351  [40] if he had escaped unharmed with his fair share of the plunder.[41] For so it is fated that he shall see his people and come back[42] to his house with the high roof and to the land of his fathers.”[43] He spoke, nor disobeyed him the courier Argeïphontes.[44] Immediately he bound upon his feet the fair sandals,[45] golden and immortal, that carried him over the water[46] as over the dry boundless earth abreast of the wind’s blast.[47] He caught up the staff, with which he mazes the eyes of those mortals[48] whose eyes he would maze, or wakes again the sleepers. Holding[49] this in his hands, strong Argeïphontes winged his way onward.[50] He stood on Pieria and launched himself from the bright air[51] across the sea and sped the wave tops, like a shearwater[52] who along the deadly deep ways of the barren salt sea[53] goes hunting fish and sprays quick-beating wings in the salt brine.[54] In such a likeness Hermes rode over much tossing water.[55] But after he had made his way to the far-lying island,[56] he stepped then out of the dark blue sea, and walked on over[57] the dry land, till he came to the great cave, where the lovely-haired[58] nymph was at home, and he found that she was inside. There was[59] a great fire blazing on the hearth, and the smell of cedar[60] split in billets, and sweetwood burning, spread all over[61] the island. She was singing inside the cave with a sweet voice[62] as she went up and down the loom and wove with a golden shuttle.[63] There was a growth of grove around the cavern, flourishing,[64] alder was there, and the black poplar, and fragrant cypress,[65] and there were birds with spreading wings who made their nests in it,[66] little owls, and hawks, and birds of the sea with long beaks[67] who are like ravens, but all their work is on the sea water;[68] and right about the hollow cavern extended a flourishing[69] growth of vine that ripened with grape clusters. Next to it[70] there were four fountains, and each of them ran shining water,[71] each next to each, but turned to run in sundry directions;[72] and round about there were meadows growing soft with parsley[73] and violets, and even a god who came into that place[74] would have admired what he saw, the heart delighted within him.[75] There the courier Argeïphontes stood and admired it.[76] But after he had admired all in his heart, he went in[77] to the wide cave, nor did the shining goddess Kalypso[78] fail to recognize him when she saw him come into her presence;[79] for the immortal gods are not such as to go unrecognized[80] by one another, not even if one lives in a far home.[81] But Hermes did not find great-hearted Odysseus indoors,[82] but he was sitting out on the beach, crying, as before now[83] he had done, breaking his heart in tears, lamentation, and sorrow,[84] as weeping tears he looked out over the barren water.[85] But Kalypso, shining among goddesses, questioned Hermes[86] when she had seated him on a chair that shone and glittered:[87] “How is it, Hermes of the golden staff, you have come to me?[88] I honor you and love you; but you have not come much before this.[89] Speak what is in your mind. My heart is urgent to do it[90] if I can, and if it is a thing that can be accomplished.[91] But come in with me, so I can put entertainment before you.”[92] So the goddess spoke, and she set before him a table  p 352  [93] which she had filled with ambrosia, and mixed red nectar for him.[94] The courier, Hermes Argeïphontes, ate and drank then,[95] but when he had dined and satisfied his hunger with eating,[96] then he began to speak, answering what she had asked him:[97] “You, a goddess, ask me, a god, why I came, and therefore[98] I will tell you the whole truth of the tale. It is you who ask me.[99] It was Zeus who told me to come here. I did not wish to.[100] Who would willingly make the run across this endless[101] salt water? And there is no city of men nearby, nor people[102] who offer choice hecatombs to the gods, and perform sacrifice.[103] But there is no way for another god to elude the purpose[104] of aegis-bearing Zeus or bring it to nothing. He says[105] you have with you the man who is wretched beyond all the other[106] men of all those who fought around the city of Priam[107] for nine years, and in the tenth they sacked the city and set sail[108] for home, but on the voyage home they offended Athene,[109] who let loose an evil tempest and tall waves against them.[110] Then all the rest of his excellent companions perished,[111] but the wind and the current carried him here and here they drove him.[112] Now Zeus tells you to send him on his way with all speed.[113] It is not appointed for him to die here, away from his people.[114] It is still his fate that he shall see his people and come back[115] to his house with the high roof and to the land of his fathers.”[116] So he spoke, and Kalypso, shining among divinities,[117] shuddered, and answered him in winged words and addressed him:[118] “You are hard-hearted, you gods, and jealous beyond all creatures[119] beside, when you are resentful toward the goddesses for sleeping[120] openly with such men as each has made her true husband.[121] So when Dawn of the rosy fingers chose out Orion,[122] all you gods who live at your ease were full of resentment,[123] until chaste Artemis of the golden throne in Ortygia[124] came with a visitation of painless arrows and killed him;[125] and so it was when Demeter of the lovely hair, yielding[126] to her desire, lay down with Iasion and loved him[127] in a thrice-turned field, it was not long before this was made known[128] to Zeus, who struck him down with a cast of the shining thunderbolt.[129] So now, you gods, you resent it in me that I keep beside me[130] a man, the one I saved when he clung astride of the keel board[131] all alone, since Zeus with a cast of the shining thunderbolt[132] had shattered his fast ship midway on the wine-blue water.[133] Then all the rest of his excellent companions perished,[134] but the wind and the current carried him here and here they drove him,[135] and I gave him my love and cherished him, and I had hopes also[136] that I could make him immortal and all his days to be endless.[137] But since there is no way for another god to elude the purpose[138] of aegis-bearing Zeus or bring it to nothing, let him go,[139] let him go, if he himself is asking for this and desires it,[140] out on the barren sea; but I will not give him conveyance,[141] for I have not any ships by me nor any companions[142] who can convey him back across the sea’s wide ridges;[143] but I will freely give him my counsel and hold back nothing,[144] so that all without harm he can come back to his own country.”  p 353  [145] Then in turn the courier Argeïphontes answered her:[146] “Then send him accordingly on his way, and beware of the anger[147] of Zeus, lest he hold a grudge hereafter and rage against you.”[148] So spoke powerful Argeïphontes and there he left her,[149] while she, the queenly nymph, when she had been given the message[150] from Zeus, set out searching after great-hearted Odysseus,[151] and found him sitting on the seashore, and his eyes were never[152] wiped dry of tears, and the sweet lifetime was draining out of him,[153] as he wept for a way home, since the nymph was no longer pleasing[154] to him. By nights he would lie beside her, of necessity,[155] in the hollow caverns, against his will, by one who was willing,[156] but all the days he would sit upon the rocks, at the seaside,[157] breaking his heart in tears and lamentation and sorrow[158] as weeping tears he looked out over the barren water.[159] She, bright among divinities, stood near and spoke to him:[160] “Poor man, no longer mourn here beside me nor let your lifetime[161] fade away, since now I will send you on, with a good will.[162] So come, cut long timbers with a bronze ax and join them[163] to make a wide raft, and fashion decks that will be on the upper[164] side, to carry you over the misty face of the water.[165] Then I will stow aboard her bread and water and ruddy[166] wine, strength-giving goods that will keep the hunger from you,[167] and put clothing on you, and send a following stern wind after,[168] so that all without harm you can come back to your own country,[169] if only the gods consent. It is they who hold wide heaven.[170] And they are more powerful than I to devise and accomplish.”[171] So she spoke to him, but long-suffering great Odysseus[172] shuddered to hear, and spoke again in turn and addressed her:[173] “Here is some other thing you devise, O goddess; it is not[174] conveyance, when you tell me to cross the sea’s great open[175] space on a raft. That is dangerous and hard. Not even[176] balanced ships rejoicing in a wind from Zeus cross over.[177] I will not go aboard any raft without your good will,[178] nor unless, goddess, you can bring yourself to swear me a great oath[179] that this is not some painful trial you are planning against me.”[180] So he spoke, and Kalypso, shining among divinities,[181] smiled and stroked him with her hand and spoke to him and named him:[182] “You are so naughty, and you will have your own way in all things.[183] See how you have spoken to me and reason with me.[184] Earth be my witness in this, and the wide heaven above us,[185] and the dripping water of the Styx, which oath is the biggest[186] and most formidable oath among the blessed immortals,[187] that this is no other painful trial I am planning against you,[188] but I am thinking and planning for you just as I would do it[189] for my own self, if such needs as yours were to come upon me;[190] for the mind in me is reasonable, and I have no spirit[191] of iron inside my heart. Rather, it is compassionate.”[192] So she spoke, a shining goddess, and led the way swiftly,[193] and the man followed behind her walking in the god’s footsteps.[194] They made their way, the man and the god, to the hollow cavern,[195] and he seated himself upon the chair from which Hermes lately[196] had risen, while the nymph set all manner of food before him  p 354  [197] to eat and drink, such things as mortal people feed upon.[198] She herself sat across the table from godlike Odysseus,[199] and her serving maids set nectar and ambrosia before her.[200] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[201] But after they had taken their pleasure in eating and drinking,[202] the talking was begun by the shining goddess Kalypso:[203] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[204] are you still all so eager to go on back to your own house[205] and the land of your fathers? I wish you well, however you do it,[206] but if you only knew in your own heart how many hardships[207] you were fated to undergo before getting back to your country,[208] you would stay here with me and be the lord of this household[209] and be an immortal, for all your longing once more to look on[210] that wife for whom you are pining all your days here. And yet[211] I think that I can claim that I am not her inferior[212] either in build or stature, since it is not likely that mortal[213] women can challenge the goddesses for build and beauty.”[214] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[215] “Goddess and queen, do not be angry with me. I myself know[216] that all you say is true and that circumspect Penelope[217] can never match the impression you make for beauty and stature.[218] She is mortal after all, and you are immortal and ageless.[219] But even so, what I want and all my days I pine for[220] is to go back to my house and see my day of homecoming.[221] And if some god batters me far out on the wine-blue water,[222] I will endure it, keeping a stubborn spirit inside me,[223] for already I have suffered much and done much hard work[224] on the waves and in the fighting. So let this adventure follow.”[225] So he spoke, and the sun went down and the darkness came over.[226] These two, withdrawn in the inner recess of the hollowed cavern,[227] enjoyed themselves in love and stayed all night by each other,[228] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[229] Odysseus wrapped himself in an outer cloak and a tunic,[230] while she, the nymph, mantled herself in a gleaming white robe[231] fine-woven and delightful, and around her waist she fastened[232] a handsome belt of gold, and on her head was a wimple.[233] She set about planning the journey for great-hearted Odysseus.[234] She gave him a great ax that was fitted to his palms and headed[235] with bronze, with a double edge each way, and fitted inside it[236] a very beautiful handle of olive wood, well hafted;[237] then she gave him a well-finished adze, and led the way onward[238] to the far end of the island where there were trees, tall grown,[239] alder and black poplar and fir that towered to the heaven,[240] but all gone dry long ago and dead, so they would float lightly.[241] But when she had shown him where the tall trees grew, Kalypso,[242] shining among divinities, went back to her own house[243] while he turned to cutting his timbers and quickly had his work finished.[244] He threw down twenty in all, and trimmed them well with his bronze ax,[245] and planed them expertly, and trued them straight to a chalkline.[246] Kalypso, the shining goddess, at that time came back, bringing him[247] an auger, and he bored through them all and pinned them together[248] with dowels, and then with cords he lashed his raft together.  p 355  [249] And as great as is the bottom of a broad cargo-carrying[250] ship, when a man well skilled in carpentry fashions it, such was[251] the size of the broad raft made for himself by Odysseus.[252] Next, setting up the deck boards and fitting them to close uprights[253] he worked them on, and closed in the ends with sweeping gunwales.[254] Then he fashioned the mast, with an upper deck fitted to it,[255] and made in addition a steering oar by which to direct her,[256] and fenced her in down the whole length with wattles of osier[257] to keep the water out, and expended much timber upon this.[258] Next Kalypso, the shining goddess, brought out the sail cloth[259] to make the sails with, and he carefully worked these also,[260] and attached the straps and halyards and sheets all in place aboard her,[261] and then with levers worked her down to the bright salt water.[262] It was the fourth day and all his work was finished. Then on[263] the fifth day shining Kalypso saw him off from the island[264] when she had bathed him and put fragrant clothing upon him,[265] and the goddess put two skins aboard, one filled with dark wine[266] and the other, the big one, filled with water, and put on provisions[267] in a bag, and stored there many good things to keep a man’s strength up,[268] and sent a following wind to carry him, warm and easy.[269] Glorious Odysseus, happy with the wind, spread sails[270] and taking his seat artfully with the steering oar he held her[271] on her course, nor did sleep ever descend on his eyelids[272] as he kept his eye on the Pleiades and late-setting Bootes,[273] and the Bear, to whom men give also the name of the Wagon,[274] who turns about in a fixed place and looks at Orion,[275] and she alone is never plunged in the wash of the Ocean.[276] For so Kalypso, bright among goddesses, had told him[277] to make his way over the sea, keeping the Bear on his left hand.[278] Seventeen days he sailed, making his way over the water,[279] and on the eighteenth day there showed the shadowy mountains[280] of the Phaiakian land where it stood out nearest to him,[281] and it looked like a shield lying on the misty face of the water.[282] Coming back from the Aithiopians the strong Earthshaker[283] saw him from far on the mountains of the Solymoi. He was visible[284] sailing over the sea. Poseidon was the more angered[285] with him, and shook his head, and spoke to his own spirit:[286] “For shame, surely the gods have rashly changed their intentions[287] about Odysseus while I was away in the Aithiopians’[288] land, and he nears the Phaiakian country where it is appointed[289] that he shall escape this great trial of misery that is now his.[290] But I think I can still give him a good full portion of trouble.”[291] He spoke, and pulled the clouds together, in both hands gripping[292] the trident, and staggered the sea, and let loose all the stormblasts[293] of all the winds together, and huddled under the cloud scuds[294] land alike and the great water. Night sprang from heaven.[295] East Wind and South Wind clashed together, and the bitter blown West Wind[296] and the North Wind born in the bright air rolled up a heavy sea.[297] The knees of Odysseus gave way for fear, and the heart inside him,[298] and deeply troubled he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[299] “Ah me unhappy, what in the long outcome will befall me?  p 356  [300] I fear the goddess might have spoken the truth in all ways[301] when he said that on the sea and before I came to my country[302] I would go through hardships; now all this is being accomplished,[303] such clouds are these, with which Zeus is cramming the wide sky[304] and has staggered the sea, and stormblasts of winds from every[305] direction are crowding in. My sheer destruction is certain.[306] Three times and four times happy those Danaans were who died then[307] in wide Troy land, bringing favor to the sons of Atreus,[308] as I wish I too had died at that time and met my destiny[309] on the day when the greatest number of Trojans threw their bronze-headed[310] weapons upon me, over the body of perished Achilleus,[311] and I would have had my rites and the Achaians given me glory.[312] Now it is by a dismal death that I must be taken.”[313] As he spoke so, a great wave drove down from above him[314] with a horrible rush, and spun the raft in a circle,[315] and he was thrown clear far from the raft and let the steering oar[316] slip from his hands. A terrible gust of stormwinds whirling[317] together and blowing snapped the mast tree off in the middle,[318] and the sail and the upper deck were thrown far and fell in the water.[319] He himself was ducked for a long time, nor was he able[320] to come up quickly from under the great rush of the water,[321] for the clothing which divine Kalypso had given weighted him[322] down. At last he got to the surface, and spat the bitter[323] salt sea water that drained from his head, which was filled with it.[324] But he did not forget about his raft, for all his trouble,[325] but turned and swam back through the waves, and laid hold of it,[326] and huddled down in the middle of it, avoiding death’s end.[327] Then the waves tossed her about the current now here, now there;[328] as the North Wind in autumn tumbles and tosses thistledown[329] along the plain, and the bunches hold fast one on another,[330] so the winds tossed her on the great sea, now here, now there,[331] and now it would be South Wind and North that pushed her between them,[332] and then again East Wind and West would burst in and follow.[333] The daughter of Kadmos, sweet-stepping Ino called Leukothea,[334] saw him. She had once been one who spoke as a mortal,[335] but now in the gulfs of the sea she holds degree as a goddess.[336] She took pity on Odysseus as he drifted and suffered hardship,[337] and likening herself to a winged gannet she came up[338] out of the water and perched on the raft and spoke a word to him:[339] “Poor man, why is Poseidon the shaker of the earth so bitterly[340] cankered against you, to give you such a harvest of evils?[341] And yet he will not do away with you, for all his anger.[342] But do as I say, since you seem to me not lacking in good sense.[343] Take off these clothes, and leave the raft to drift at the winds’ will,[344] and then strike out and swim with your hands and make for a landfall[345] on the Phaiakian country, where your escape is destined.[346] And here, take this veil, it is immortal, and fasten it under[347] your chest; and there is no need for you to die, nor to suffer.[348] But when with both your hands you have taken hold of the mainland,[349] untie the veil and throw it out in the wine-blue water[350] far from the land; and turn your face away as you do so.”[351] So spoke the goddess and handed him the veil, then herself  p 357  [352] in the likeness of a gannet slipped back into the heaving[353] sea, and the dark and tossing water closed above her.[354] Now long-suffering great Odysseus pondered two courses,[355] and troubled he spoke then to his own great-hearted spirit:[356] “Ah me, which of the immortals is weaving deception[357] against me, and tells me to put off from the raft? But no,[358] I will not do it yet, since I have seen with my own eyes[359] that the shore, where she said I could escape, is still far from me.[360] But here is what I will do, and this seems to me the best way.[361] As long as the timbers hold together and the construction[362] remains, I will stay with it and endure though suffering hardships;[363] but once the heaving sea has shaken my raft to pieces,[364] then I will swim. There is nothing better that I can think of.”[365] Now as he was pondering these ways in his heart and spirit,[366] Poseidon, shaker of the earth, drove on a great wave,[367] that was terrible and rough, and it curled over and broke down[368] upon him, and as when the wind blows hard on a dry pile[369] of chaff, and scatters it abroad in every direction,[370] so the raft’s long timbers were scattered, but now Odysseus[371] sat astride one beam, like a man riding on horseback,[372] and stripped off the clothing which the divine Kalypso had given him,[373] and rapidly tied the veil of Ino around his chest, then[374] threw himself head first in the water, and with his arms spread[375] stroked as hard as he could. The strong Earthshaker saw him[376] swimming, and shook his head and spoke to his own spirit:[377] “There, now, drift on the open sea, suffering much trouble,[378] until you come among certain people who are the gods’ fosterlings.[379] Even so, I hope you will not complain that I stinted your hardships.”[380] So he spoke, and laid the lash on his fair-maned horses,[381] and made his way to Aigai, where he has his fabulous palace.[382] But now Athene, daughter of Zeus, planned what was to follow.[383] She fastened down the courses of all the rest of the stormwinds,[384] and told them all to go to sleep now and to give over,[385] but stirred a hastening North Wind, and broke down the seas before him,[386] until Zeus-sprung Odysseus, escaping death and the spirits[387] of death, might join the company of oar-loving Phaiakians.[388] Then he was driven two nights and two days on the heavy[389] seas, and many times his heart foresaw destruction,[390] but when Dawn with the lovely hair had brought the third morning,[391] then at last the gale went down and windless weather[392] came on, and now he saw the land lying very close to him[393] as he took a sharp look, lifted high on the top of a great wave.[394] And as welcome as the show of life again in a father[395] is to his children, when he has lain sick, suffering strong pains,[396] and wasting long away, and the hateful death spirit has brushed him,[397] but then, and it is welcome, the gods set him free of his sickness,[398] so welcome appeared land and forest now to Odysseus,[399] and he swam, pressing on, so as to set foot on the mainland.[400] But when he was as far away as a voice can carry[401] he heard the thumping of the sea on the jagged rock-teeth,[402] for a big surf, terribly sucked up from the main, was crashing[403] on the dry land, all was mantled in salt spray, and there were  p 358  [404] no harbors to hold ships, no roadsteads for them to ride in,[405] but promontories out-thrust and ragged rock-teeth and boulders.[406] The knees of Odysseus gave way for fear, and the heart inside him,[407] and deeply troubled he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[408] “Ah me, now that Zeus has granted a sight of unhoped-for[409] land, and now I have made the crossing of this great distance,[410] I see no way for me to get out of the gray sea water,[411] for on the outer side are sharp rocks, and the surf about them[412] breaks and roars, and the sheer of the cliff runs up above them,[413] and the sea is deep close in shore so that there is no place[414] to stand bracing on both my feet and so avoid trouble.[415] I fear that as I climb out a great wave will catch and throw me[416] against the stony cliff. That will be a pitiful landing.[417] Yet if I try to swim on along in the hope of finding[418] beaches that slant against the waves or harbors for shelter[419] from the sea, I fear that once again the whirlwind will snatch me[420] and carry me out on the sea where the fish swarm, groaning heavily,[421] or else the divinity from the deep will let loose against me[422] a sea monster, of whom Amphitrite keeps so many;[423] for I know how bitterly the renowned Earthshaker hates me.”[424] Now as he was pondering this in his heart and spirit,[425] meanwhile a great wave carried him against the rough rock face,[426] and there his skin would have been taken off, his bones crushed together,[427] had not the gray-eyed goddess Athene sent him an inkling,[428] and he frantically caught hold with both hands on the rock face[429] and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went over. This one[430] he so escaped, but the backwash of the same wave caught him[431] where he clung and threw him far out in the open water.[432] As when an octopus is dragged away from its shelter[433] the thickly-clustered pebbles stick in the cups of the tentacles,[434] so in contact with the rock the skin from his bold hands[435] was torn away. Now the great sea covered him over,[436] and Odysseus would have perished, wretched, beyond his destiny,[437] had not the gray-eyed goddess Athene given him forethought.[438] He got clear of the surf, where it sucks against the land, and swam on[439] along, looking always toward the shore in the hope of finding[440] beaches that slanted against the waves or harbors for shelter[441] from the sea, but when he came, swimming along, to the mouth of[442] a sweet-running river, this at last seemed to him the best place,[443] being bare of rocks, and there was even shelter from the wind there.[444] He saw where the river came out and prayed to him in his spirit:[445] “Hear me, my lord, whoever you are. I come in great need[446] to you, a fugitive from the sea and the curse of Poseidon;[447] even for immortal gods that man has a claim on their mercy[448] who comes to them as a wandering man, in the way that I now[449] come to your current and to your knees after much suffering.[450] Pity me then, my lord. I call myself your suppliant.”[451] He spoke, and the river stayed his current, stopped the waves breaking,[452] and made all quiet in front of him and let him get safely[453] into the outlet of the river. Now he flexed both knees[454] and his ponderous hands; his very heart was sick with salt water,[455] and all his flesh was swollen, and the sea water crusted stiffly  p 359  [456] in his mouth and nostrils, and with a terrible weariness fallen[457] upon him he lay unable to breathe or speak in his weakness.[458] But when he got his breath back and the spirit regathered into[459] his heart, he at last unbound the veil of the goddess from him,[460] and let it go, to drift in the seaward course of the river,[461] and the great wave carried it out on the current, and presently Ino[462] took it back into her hands. Odysseus staggered from the river[463] and lay down again in the rushes and kissed the grain-giving soil.[464] Then deeply troubled he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[465] “What will happen now, and what in the long outcome will befall me?[466] For if I wait out the uncomfortable night by the river,[467] I fear that the female dew and the evil frost together[468] will be too much for my damaged strength, I am so exhausted,[469] and in the morning a chilly wind will blow from the river;[470] but if I go up the slope and into the shadowy forest,[471] and lie down to sleep among the dense bushes, even if the chill[472] and weariness let me be, and a sweet sleep comes upon me,[473] I fear I may become spoil and prey to the wild animals.”[474] In the division of his heart this last way seemed best,[475] and he went to look for the wood and found it close to the water[476] in a conspicuous place, and stopped underneath two bushes[477] that grew from the same place, one of shrub, and one of wild olive,[478] and neither the force of wet-blowing winds could penetrate these[479] nor could the shining sun ever strike through with his rays, nor yet[480] could the rain pass all the way through them, so close together[481] were they grown, interlacing each other; and under these now Odysseus[482] entered, and with his own hands heaped him a bed to sleep on,[483] making it wide, since there was great store of fallen leaves there,[484] enough for two men to take cover in or even three men[485] in the winter season, even in the very worst kind of weather.[486] Seeing this, long-suffering great Odysseus was happy,[487] and lay down in the middle, and made a pile of leaves over him.[488] As when a man buries a burning log in a black ash heap[489] in a remote place in the country, where none live near as neighbors,[490] and saves the seed of fire, having no other place to get a light[491] from, so Odysseus buried himself in the leaves, and Athene[492] shed a sleep on his eyes so as most quickly to quit him,[493] by veiling his eyes, from the exhaustion of his hard labors.book six[1] So long-suffering great Odysseus slept in that place[2] in an exhaustion of sleep and weariness, and now Athene[3] went her way to the district and city of the Phaiakian[4] men, who formerly lived in the spacious land, Hypereia,[5] next to the Cyclopes, who were men too overbearing,[6] and who had kept harrying them, being greater in strength. From here[7] godlike Nausithoös had removed and led a migration,[8] and settled in Scheria, far away from men who eat bread,[9] and driven a wall about the city, and built the houses,[10] and made the temples of the gods, and allotted the holdings.  p 360  [11] But now he had submitted to his fate, and gone to Hades’,[12] and Alkinoös, learned in designs from the gods, now ruled there.[13] It was to his house that the gray-eyed goddess Athene[14] went, devising the homecoming of great-hearted Odysseus,[15] and she went into the ornate chamber, in which a girl[16] was sleeping, like the immortal goddesses for stature and beauty,[17] Nausikaa, the daughter of the great-hearted Alkinoös,[18] and beside her two handmaidens with beauty given from the Graces[19] slept on either side of the post with the shining doors closed.[20] She drifted in a like breath of wind to where the girl slept,[21] and came and stood above her head and spoke a word to her,[22] likening herself to the daughter of Dymas, famed for seafaring,[23] a girl of the same age, in whom her fancy delighted.[24] In this likeness the gray-eyed Athene spoke to her:[25] “Nausikaa, how could your mother have a child so careless?[26] The shining clothes are lying away uncared for, while your[27] marriage is not far off, when you should be in your glory[28] for clothes to wear, and provide too for those who attend you.[29] It is from such things that a good reputation among people[30] springs up, giving pleasure to your father and the lady your mother.[31] So let us go on a washing tomorrow when dawn shows. I too[32] will go along with you and help you, so you can have all[33] done most quickly, since you will not long stay unmarried.[34] For already you are being courted by all the best men[35] of the Phaiakians hereabouts, and you too are a Phaiakian.[36] So come, urge your famous father early in the morning[37] to harness the mules and wagon for you, and it shall carry[38] the sashes and dresses and shining coverlets for you. In this way[39] it will be so much more becoming than for you to go there[40] on foot, for the washing places are a long way from the city.”[41] So the gray-eyed Athene spoke and went away from her[42] to Olympos, where the abode of the gods stands firm and unmoving[43] forever, they say, and is not shaken with winds nor spattered[44] with rains, nor does snow pile ever there, but the shining bright air[45] stretches cloudless away, and the white light glances upon it.[46] And there, and all their days, the blessed gods take their pleasure.[47] There the Gray-eyed One went, when she had talked with the young girl.[48] And the next the Dawn came, throned in splendor, and wakened the well-robed[49] girl Nausikaa, and she wondered much at her dreaming,[50] and went through the house, so as to give the word to her parents,[51] to her dear father and her mother. She found them within there;[52] the queen was sitting by the fireside with her attendant[53] women, turning sea-purple yarn on a distaff; her father[54] she met as he was going out the door to the council[55] of famed barons, where the proud Phaiakians used to summon him.[56] She stood very close up to her dear father and spoke to him:[57] “Daddy dear, will you not have them harness me the wagon,[58] the high one with the good wheels, so that I can take the clothing[59] to the river and wash it? Now it is lying about, all dirty,[60] and you yourself, when you sit among the first men in council[61] and share their counsels, ought to have clean clothing about you;  p 361  [62] and also, you have five dear sons who are grown in the palace,[63] two of them married, and the other three are sprightly bachelors,[64] and they are forever wanting clean fresh clothing, to wear it[65] when they go to dance, and it is my duty to think about all this.”[66] So she spoke, but she was ashamed to speak of her joyful[67] marriage to her dear father, but he understood all and answered:[68] “I do not begrudge you the mules, child, nor anything[69] else. So go, and the serving men will harness the wagon,[70] the high one with the good wheels that has the carrying basket.”[71] He spoke, and gave the order to the serving men. These obeyed,[72] and brought the mule wagon with good wheels outside and put it[73] together, and led the mules under the yoke and harnessed them,[74] and the girl brought the bright clothing out from the inner chamber[75] and laid it in the well-polished wagon. Meanwhile her mother[76] put in a box all manner of food, which would preserve strength,[77] and put many good things to eat with it, and poured out[78] wine in a goatskin bottle, and her daughter put that in the wagon.[79] She gave her limpid olive oil in a golden oil flask[80] for her and her attendant women to use for anointing.[81] Nausikaa took up the whip and the shining reins, then[82] whipped them into a start and the mules went noisily forward[83] and pulled without stint, carrying the girl and the clothing.[84] She was not alone. The rest, her handmaidens, walked on beside her.[85] Now when they had come to the delightful stream of the river,[86] where there was always a washing place, and plenty of glorious[87] water that ran through to wash what was ever so dirty,[88] there they unyoked the mules and set them free from the wagon,[89] and chased them out along the bank of the swirling river[90] to graze on the sweet river grass, while they from the wagon[91] lifted the wash in their hands and carried it to the black water,[92] and stamped on it in the basins, making a race and game of it[93] until they had washed and rinsed all dirt away, then spread it[94] out in line along the beach of the sea, where the water[95] of the sea had washed the most big pebbles up on the dry shore.[96] Then they themselves, after bathing and anointing themselves with olive oil,[97] ate their dinner all along by the banks of the river[98] and waited for the laundry to dry out in the sunshine.[99] But when she and her maids had taken their pleasure in eating,[100] they all threw off their veils for a game of ball, and among them[101] it was Nausikaa of the white arms who led in the dancing;[102] and as Artemis, who showers arrows, moves on the mountains[103] either along Taÿgetos or on high-towering[104] Erymanthos, delighting in boars and deer in their running,[105] and along with her the nymphs, daughters of Zeus of the aegis,[106] range in the wilds and play, and the heart of Leto is gladdened,[107] for the head and the brows of Artemis are above all the others,[108] and she is easily marked among them, though all are lovely,[109] so this one shone among her handmaidens, a virgin unwedded.[110] But now, when she was about ready once more to harness[111] the mules, and fold the splendid clothing, and start on the way home,[112] then the gray-eyed goddess Athene thought what to do next;  p 362  [113] how Odysseus should awake, and see the well-favored young girl,[114] and she should be his guide to the city of the Phaiakians.[115] Now the princess threw the ball toward one handmaiden,[116] and missed the girl, and the ball went into the swirling water,[117] and they all cried out aloud, and noble Odysseus wakened[118] and sat up and began pondering in his heart and his spirit:[119] “Ah me, what are the people whose land I have come to this time,[120] and are they violent and savage, and without justice,[121] or hospitable to strangers, with a godly mind? See now[122] how an outcry of young women echoes about me,[123] of nymphs, who keep the sudden and sheer high mountain places[124] and springs of the rivers and grass of the meadows, or am I truly[125] in the neighborhood of human people I can converse with?[126] But come now, I myself shall see what I can discover.”[127] So speaking, great Odysseus came from under his thicket,[128] and from the dense foliage with his heavy hand he broke off[129] a leafy branch to cover his body and hide the male parts,[130] and went in the confidence of his strength, like some hill-kept lion,[131] who advances, though he is rained on and blown by the wind, and both eyes[132] kindle; he goes out after cattle or sheep, or it may be[133] deer in the wilderness, and his belly is urgent upon him[134] to get inside of a close steading and go for the sheepflocks.[135] So Odysseus was ready to face young girls with well-ordered[136] hair, naked though he was, for the need was on him; and yet[137] he appeared terrifying to them, all crusted with dry spray,[138] and they scattered one way and another down the jutting beaches.[139] Only the daughter of Alkinoös stood fast, for Athene[140] put courage into her heart, and took the fear from her body,[141] and she stood her ground and faced him, and now Odysseus debated[142] whether to supplicate the well-favored girl by clasping[143] her knees, or stand off where he was and in words of blandishment[144] ask if she would show him the city, and lend him clothing.[145] Then in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[146] to stand well off and supplicate in words of blandishment,[147] for fear that, if he clasped her knees, the girl might be angry.[148] So blandishingly and full of craft he began to address her:[149] “I am at your knees, O queen. But are you mortal or goddess?[150] If indeed you are one of the gods who hold wide heaven,[151] then I must find in you nearest likeness to Artemis[152] the daughter of great Zeus, for beauty, figure, and stature.[153] But if you are one among those mortals who live in this country,[154] three times blessed are your father and the lady your mother,[155] and three times blessed your brothers too, and I know their spirits[156] are warmed forever with happiness at the thought of you, seeing[157] such a slip of beauty taking her place in the chorus of dancers;[158] but blessed at the heart, even beyond these others, is that one[159] who, after loading you down with gifts, leads you as his bride[160] home. I have never with these eyes seen anything like you,[161] neither man nor woman. Wonder takes me as I look on you.[162] Yet in Delos once I saw such a thing, by Apollo’s altar.[163] I saw the stalk of a young palm shooting up. I had gone there[164] once, and with a following of a great many people,  p 363  [165] on that journey which was to mean hard suffering for me.[166] And as, when I looked upon that tree, my heart admired it[167] long, since such a tree had never yet sprung from the earth, so[168] now, lady, I admire you and wonder, and am terribly[169] afraid to clasp you by the knees. The hard sorrow is on me.[170] Yesterday on the twentieth day I escaped the wine-blue[171] sea; until then the current and the tearing winds had swept me[172] along from the island Ogygia, and my fate has landed me[173] here; here too I must have evil to suffer; I do not[174] think it will stop; before then the gods have much to give me.[175] Then have pity, O queen. You are the first I have come to[176] after much suffering, there is no one else that I know of[177] here among the people who hold this land and this city.[178] Show me the way to the town and give me some rag to wrap me[179] in, if you had any kind of piece of cloth when you came here,[180] and then may the gods give you everything that your heart longs for;[181] may they grant you a husband and a house and sweet agreement[182] in all things, for nothing is better than this, more steadfast[183] than when two people, a man and his wife, keep a harmonious[184] household; a thing that brings much distress to the people who hate them[185] and pleasure to their well-wishers, and for them the best reputation.”[186] Then in turn Nausikaa of the white arms answered him:[187] “My friend, since you seem not like a thoughtless man, nor a mean one,[188] it is Zeus himself, the Olympian, who gives people good fortune,[189] to each single man, to the good and the bad, just as he wishes;[190] and since he must have given you yours, you must even endure it.[191] But now, since it is our land and our city that you have come to,[192] you shall not lack for clothing nor anything else, of those gifts[193] which should befall the unhappy suppliant on his arrival;[194] and I will show you our town, and tell you the name of our people.[195] It is the Phaiakians who hold this territory and city,[196] and I myself am the daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös,[197] whose power and dominion are held by right, given from the Phaiakians.”[198] She spoke, and to her attendants with well-ordered hair gave instruction:[199] “Stand fast, girls. Where are you flying, just because you have looked on[200] a man? Do you think this is some enemy coming against us?[201] There is no such man living nor can there ever be one[202] who can come into the land of the Phaiakians bringing[203] warlike attack; we are so very dear to the immortals,[204] and we live far apart by ourselves in the wash of the great sea[205] at the utter end, nor do any other people mix with us.[206] But, since this is some poor wanderer who has come to us,[207] we must now take care of him, since all strangers and wanderers[208] are sacred in the sight of Zeus, and the gift is a light and a dear one.[209] So, my attendants, give some food and drink to the stranger,[210] and bathe him, where there is shelter from the wind, in the river.”[211] She spoke, and they stopped their fight, encouraging each other,[212] and led Odysseus down to the sheltered place, as Nausikaa[213] daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös had told them[214] to do, and laid out for him to wear a mantle and tunic,[215] and gave him limpid olive oil in a golden oil flask,[216] and told him could bathe himself in the stream of the river.  p 364  [217] Then the glorious Odysseus spoke to these serving maids:[218] “Stand as you are, girls, a little away from me, so that[219] I can wash the salt off my shoulders and use the olive oil[220] on them. It is long since my skin has known any ointment.[221] But I will not bathe in front of you, for I feel embarrassed[222] in the presence of lovely-haired girls to appear all naked.”[223] He spoke, and they went away and told it to their young mistress.[224] But when great Odysseus had bathed in the river and washed from his body[225] the salt brine, which clung to his back and his broad shoulders,[226] he scraped from his head the scurf of brine from the barren salt sea.[227] But when he had bathed all, and anointed himself with olive oil,[228] and put on the clothing this unwedded girl had given him,[229] then Athene, daughter of Zeus, made him seem taller[230] for the eye to behold, and thicker, and on his head she arranged[231] the curling locks that hung down like hyacinthine petals.[232] And as when a master craftsman overlays gold on silver,[233] and he is one who was taught by Hephaistos and Pallas Athene[234] in art complete, and grace is on every work he finishes,[235] so Athene gilded with grace his head and his shoulders,[236] and he went a little aside and sat by himself on the seashore,[237] radiant in grace and good looks; and the girl admired him.[238] It was to her attendants with well-ordered hair that she now spoke:[239] “Hear me, my white-armed serving women; let me say something.[240] It is not against the will of all the gods on Olympos[241] that this man is here to be made known to the godlike Phaiakians.[242] A while ago he seemed an unpromising man to me. Now[243] he even resembles one of the gods, who hold high heaven.[244] If only the man to be called my husband could be like this one,[245] a man living here, if only this one were pleased to stay here.[246] But come, my attendants, give some food and drink to the stranger.”[247] So she spoke, and they listened well to her and obeyed her,[248] and they set food and drink down beside Odysseus. He then,[249] noble and long-suffering Odysseus, eagerly[250] ate and drank, since he had not tasted food for a long time.[251] Then Nausikaa of the white arms thought what to do next.[252] She folded the laundry and put it away in the fine mule wagon,[253] and yoked the mules with powerful hooves, and herself mounted,[254] and urged Odysseus and spoke a word and named him by title:[255] “Rise up now, stranger, to go to the city, so I can see you[256] to the house of my own prudent father, where I am confident[257] you will be made known to all the highest Phaiakians.[258] Or rather, do it this way; you seem to me not to be thoughtless.[259] While we are still among the fields and the lands that the people[260] work, for that time follow the mules and the wagon, walking[261] lightly along with the maids, and I will point the way to you.[262] But when we come to the city, and around this is a towering[263] wall, and a handsome harbor either side of the city,[264] and a narrow causeway, and along the road there are oarswept[265] ships drawn up, for they all have slips, one for each vessel;[266] and there is the place of assembly, put together with quarried[267] stone, and built around a fine precinct of Poseidon,[268] and there they tend to all that gear that goes with the black ships,  p 365  [269] the hawsers and the sails, and there they fine down their oarblades;[270] for the Phaiakians have no concern with the bow or the quiver,[271] but it is all masts and the oars of ships and the balanced vessels[272] themselves, in which they delight in crossing over the gray sea;[273] and it is their graceless speech I shrink from, for fear one may mock us[274] hereafter, since there are insolent men in our community,[275] and see how one of the worse sort might say when he met us,[276] ‘Who is this large and handsome stranger whom Nausikaa[277] has with her, and where did she find him? Surely, he is[278] to be her husband, but is he a stray from some ship of alien[279] men she found for herself, since there are no such hereabouts?[280] Or did some god after much entreaty come down in answer[281] to her prayers, out of the sky, and all his days will he have her?[282] Better so, if she goes out herself and finds her a husband[283] from elsewhere, since she pays no heed to her own Phaiakian[284] neighbors, although many of these and the best ones court her.’[285] So they will speak, and that would be a scandal against me,[286] and I myself would disapprove of a girl who acted[287] so, that is, without the good will of her dear father[288] and mother making friends with a man, before being formally[289] married. Then, stranger, understand what I say, in order[290] soon to win escort and a voyage home from my father.[291] You will find a glorious grove of poplars sacred to Athene[292] near the road, and a spring runs there, and there is a meadow[293] about it, and there is my father’s estate and his flowering orchard,[294] as far from the city as the shout of a man will carry.[295] Sit down there and wait for time enough for the rest of us[296] to reach the town and make our way to my father’s palace.[297] But when you estimate that we shall have reached the palace,[298] then go to the city of the Phaiakians and inquire for[299] the palace of my father, great-hearted Alkinoös. This is[300] easily distinguished, so an innocent child could guide you[301] there, for there are no other houses built for the other[302] Phaiakians anything like the house of the hero Alkinoös.[303] But when you have disappeared inside the house and the courtyard,[304] then go on quickly across the hall until you come to[305] my mother, and she will be sitting beside the hearth, in the firelight,[306] turning sea-purple yarn on a distaff, a wonder to look at,[307] and leaning against the pillar, and her maids are sitting behind her;[308] and there is my father’s chair of state, drawn close beside her,[309] on which he sits when he drinks his wine like any immortal.[310] Go on past him and then with your arms embrace our mother’s[311] knees; do this, so as to behold your day of homecoming[312] with happiness and speed, even if you live very far off.[313] For if she has thoughts in her mind that are friendly to you,[314] then there is hope that you can see your own people, and come back[315] to your strong-founded house, and to the land of your fathers.”[316] So Nausikaa spoke and with the shining lash whipped up[317] her mules, and swiftly they left the running river behind them,[318] and the mules, neatly twinkling their feet, ran very strongly,[319] but she drove them with care, so that those on foot, Odysseus[320] and the serving maids, could keep up, and used the whip with discretion.  p 366  [321] And the sun went down and they came to the famous grove, sacred[322] to Athene; and there the great Odysseus sat down[323] and immediately thereafter prayed to the daughter of great Zeus:[324] “Hear me, Atrytone child of Zeus of the aegis,[325] and listen to me now, since before you did not listen[326] to my stricken voice as the famous shaker of the earth battered me.[327] Grant that I come, as one loved and pitied, among the Phaiakians.”[328] So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him,[329] but she did not yet show herself before him, for she respected[330] her father’s brother, Poseidon, who still nursed a sore anger[331] at godlike Odysseus until his arrival in his own country.book seven[1] So long-suffering great Odysseus prayed, in that place,[2] but the strength of the mules carried the young girl on, to the city,[3] and when she had arrived at the glorious house of her father,[4] she stopped in the forecourt, and there her brothers around her[5] came and stood, men like immortal gods. They from[6] the mule wagon unyoked the mules and carried the laundry[7] inside, and she went into her chamber. There an old woman[8] of Apeire, Eurymedousa the chamber attendant, lighted[9] a fire for her. Oarswept ships once carried her over[10] from Apeire, and they chose her out as a prize for Alkinoös[11] because he ruled all the Phaiakians and the people listened, as to[12] a god. She had nursed white-armed Nausikaa in the palace.[13] Now she lit her a fire, and prepared her a supper, indoors.[14] Then Odysseus rose to go to the city. Athene[15] with kind thought for Odysseus drifted a deep mist about him,[16] for fear some one of the great-hearted Phaiakians, meeting him,[17] might speak to him in a sneering way and ask where he came from.[18] But when he was about to enter the lovely city,[19] there the gray-eyed goddess Athene met him, in the likeness[20] of a young girl, a little maid, carrying a pitcher,[21] and she came and stood before him and great Odysseus questioned her:[22] “My child, would you not show me the way to the house of a certain[23] man, Alkinoös, who is lord over all these people?[24] For I am an unhappy stranger, and I have come here[25] a long way from a distant land, and I know nobody[26] here of the people who keep this city and the fields about it.”[27] Then in turn the gray-eyed goddess Athene answered him:[28] “Then, my friend and father, I will show you the house that you ask me[29] to show, since the king lives close beside my own stately father.[30] But go on in silence the while I lead the way for you, and do not[31] give any of these people your eye, neither ask them questions,[32] for they do not have very much patience with men from the outlands,[33] nor do they lovingly entertain the man come from elsewhere;[34] they, confident in the speed of their running ships, cross over[35] the great open water, since this is the gift of the Earthshaker[36] to them, whose ships move swift as thought, or as a winged creature.”[37] So spoke Pallas Athene and she led the way swiftly,  p 367  [38] and the man followed behind her walking in the god’s footsteps;[39] but the Phaiakians famed for seafaring were not aware of him[40] as he walked among them through their city, because Athene[41] of the ordered hair, a dread goddess, would not suffer them to, but drifted[42] a magical mist about him, as she cared for him lovingly.[43] But Odysseus now admired their balanced ships and their harbors,[44] the meeting places of the heroes themselves and the long lofty[45] walls that were joined with palisades, a wonder to look at.[46] But when they came to the king’s glorious palace, then it was[47] Pallas Athene, the gray-eyed goddess, who began speaking:[48] “Here, my friend and father, you see the house which you asked me[49] to tell you of. Here you will find the kings whom the gods love[50] busy feasting, but you go on in with a spirit that fears[51] nothing. The bold man proves the better for every action[52] in the end, even though he be a stranger coming from elsewhere.[53] First of all you will find the mistress there in her palace.[54] Arete is the name she is called, and she comes of the same[55] forebears as in fact produced the king Alkinoös.[56] First of all Poseidon, shaker of the earth, and the fairest[57] in form of women, Periboia, had a son Nausithoös.[58] She was the youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon,[59] who in his time had been king over the high-hearted Giants.[60] But he lost his recklessly daring people and himself perished,[61] but Poseidon lay in love with his daughter, and she engendered[62] Nausithoös the great-hearted, who was lord over the Phaiakians.[63] Nausithoös had children, Alkinoös and Rhexenor,[64] but Apollo of the silver bow then struck down Rhexenor,[65] married but without sons in his hall, leaving only the one child[66] Arete, and Alkinoös made her his wife, and gave her[67] such pride of place as no other woman on earth is given[68] of such women as are now alive and keep house for husbands.[69] So she was held high in the heart and still she is so,[70] by her beloved children, by Alkinoös himself, and by[71] the people, who look toward her as to a god when they see her,[72] and speak in salutation as she walks about in her city.[73] For there is no good intelligence that she herself lacks.[74] She dissolves quarrels, even among men, when she favors them.[75] So if she has thoughts in her mind that are friendly to you,[76] then there is hope that you can see your own people, and come back[77] to your house with the high roof and to the land of your fathers.”[78] So gray-eyed Athene spoke and went away from him[79] across the barren and open water, left lovely Scheria[80] and came to Marathon and to Athens of the wide ways,[81] and entered the close-built house of Erechtheus. But now Odysseus[82] came to the famous house of Alkinoös, but the heart pondered[83] much in him as he stood before coming to the bronze threshold.[84] For as from the sun the light goes or from the moon, such was[85] the glory on the high-roofed house of great-hearted Alkinoös.[86] Brazen were the walls run about it in either direction[87] from the inner room to the door, with a cobalt frieze encircling,[88] and golden were the doors that guarded the close of the palace,[89] and silver were the pillars set in the brazen threshold,  p 368  [90] and there was a silver lintel above, and a golden handle,[91] and dogs made out of gold and silver were on each side of it,[92] fashioned by Hephaistos in his craftsmanship and cunning,[93] to watch over the palace of great-hearted Alkinoös,[94] being themselves immortal, and all their days they are ageless.[95] And within, thrones were backed against the wall on both sides[96] all the way from the inner room to the door, with fine-spun[97] delicate cloths, the work of women, spread out upon them.[98] There the leaders of the Phaiakians held their sessions[99] and drank and ate, since they held these forever, and there were[100] young men fashioned all of gold and in their hands holding[101] flaring torches who stood on the strong-compounded bases,[102] and shed a gleam through the house by night, to shine on the feasters.[103] And in his house are fifty serving women, and of these[104] some grind the apple-colored grain at the turn of the hand mill,[105] and there are those who weave the webs and who turn the distaffs,[106] sitting restless as leaves of the tall black poplar, and from[107] the cloths where it is sieved oozes the limpid olive oil.[108] As much as Phaiakian men are expert beyond all others[109] for driving a fast ship on the open sea, so their women[110] are skilled in weaving and dowered with wisdom bestowed by Athene,[111] to be expert in beautiful work, to have good character.[112] On the outside of the courtyard and next the doors is his orchard,[113] a great one, four land measures, with a fence driven all around it,[114] and there is the place where his fruit trees are grown tall and flourishing,[115] pear trees and pomegranate trees and apple trees with their shining[116] fruit, and the sweet fig trees and the flourishing olive.[117] Never is the fruit spoiled on these, never does it give out,[118] neither in winter time nor summer, but always the West Wind[119] blowing on the fruits brings some to ripeness while he starts others.[120] Pear matures on pear in that place, apple upon apple,[121] grape cluster on grape cluster, fig upon fig. There also[122] he has a vineyard planted that gives abundant produce,[123] some of it a warm area on level ground where the grapes are[124] left to dry in the sun, but elsewhere they are gathering others[125] and trampling out yet others, and in front of these are unripe[126] grapes that have cast off their bloom while others are darkening.[127] And there at the bottom strip of the field are growing orderly[128] rows of greens, all kinds, and these are lush through the seasons;[129] and there two springs distribute water, one through all the garden[130] space, and one on the other side jets out by the courtyard[131] door, and the lofty house, where townspeople come for their water.[132] Such are the glorious gifts of the gods at the house of Alkinoös.[133] And there long-suffering great Odysseus stopped still and admired it.[134] But when his mind was done with all admiration, lightly[135] he stepped over the threshold and went on into the palace,[136] and there found the leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel[137] pouring libation in cups to sharp-eyed Argeïphontes[138] to whom they always poured the last drink, when mindful of bedtime.[139] But now long-suffering great Odysseus went on through the house,[140] wearing still the deep mist that Athene had drifted about him,[141] until he came to Arete and to the king, Alkinoös.  p 369  [142] Odysseus clasped Arete’s knees in his arms, and at that time[143] the magical and surrounding mist was drifted from him,[144] and all fell silent through the house when they saw the man there,[145] and they wondered looking on him, and Odysseus made his entreaty:[146] “Arete, daughter of godlike Rhexenor, after much hardship[147] I have come to your knees as a suppliant, and to your husband[148] and to these feasters, on whom may the gods bestow prosperity[149] in their own lives, and grant to each to leave to his children[150] his property in his house and the rights the people have given him.[151] But for me, urge that conveyance be given quickly[152] to my country, since long now far from my people I suffer hardships.”[153] So he spoke, and sat down beside the hearth in the ashes[154] next the fire, while all of them stayed stricken to silence.[155] But at long last the aged hero Echeneos spoke forth.[156] He was the most advanced in age of all the Phaiakians,[157] and surpassed all in words, knowing many things from time long past.[158] He in kind intention now spoke forth and addressed them:[159] “Alkinoös, this is not the better way, nor is it fitting[160] that the stranger should sit on the ground beside the hearth, in the ashes.[161] These others are holding back because they await your order.[162] But come, raise the stranger up and seat him on a silver-studded[163] chair, and tell your heralds to mix in more wine for us,[164] so we can pour a libation to Zeus who delights in the thunder,[165] and he goes together with suppliants, whose rights are sacred.[166] And let the housekeeper from her stores give the stranger a supper.”[167] But when Alkinoös of the hallowed strength had heard this,[168] he took by the hand the wise and much-devising Odysseus,[169] and raised him up from the fireside, and set him in a shining chair,[170] displacing for this powerful Laodamas, his son,[171] who had been sitting next him and who was the one he loved most.[172] A maidservant brought water for him and poured it from a splendid[173] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin[174] for him to wash, and she pulled a polished table before him.[175] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to him,[176] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions.[177] Then long-suffering great Odysseus ate and drank. After[178] this, Alkinoös, the hallowed prince, spoke to his herald:[179] “Pontonoös, now mix a wine bowl and serve it to all here[180] in the hall, to make a libation to Zeus who delights in the thunder[181] and who goes together with suppliants, whose rights are sacred.”[182] So he spoke, and Pontonoös mixed the kindly sweet wine,[183] and passed a portion to all, offering a drink in the goblets.[184] Then when they had made libation and drunk as much as each wanted,[185] Alkinoös made a public speech for them, and spoke thus:[186] “Hear me, leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel,[187] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[188] Now, having feasted, go home and take your rest, and tomorrow[189] at dawn we shall call the elders in, in greater numbers,[190] and entertain the guest in our halls, and to the immortals[191] accomplish fine sacrifices, and after that we shall think of[192] conveyance, and how our guest without annoyance or hardship[193] may come again, convoyed by us, to his own country,  p 370  [194] in happiness and speed, even though it lies very far off,[195] and on the way between suffer no pain nor evil[196] until he sets foot on his own country; but there in the future[197] he shall endure all that his destiny and the heavy Spinners[198] spun for him with the thread at his birth, when his mother bore him.[199] But if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven,[200] then this is a new kind of thing the gods are devising;[201] for always in time past the gods have shown themselves clearly[202] to us, when we render them glorious grand sacrifices,[203] and they sit beside us and feast with us in the place where we do,[204] or if one comes alone and encounters us, as a wayfarer,[205] then they make no concealment, as we are very close to them,[206] as are the Cyclopes and the savage tribes of the Giants.”[207] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[208] “Alkinoös, let something else be in your mind; I am not[209] in any way like the immortals who hold wide heaven,[210] neither in build nor stature, but only to men who are mortal.[211] Whoever it is of people you know who wear the greatest[212] burden of misery, such are the ones whom I would equal[213] for pain endured, and I could tell of still more troubles[214] that are all mine and by the will of the gods I suffered.[215] But leave me now to eat my dinner, for all my sorrow,[216] for there is no other thing so shameless as to be set over[217] the belly, but she rather uses constraint and makes me think of her,[218] even when sadly worn, when in my heart I have sorrow[219] as now I have sorrow in my heart, yet still forever[220] she tells me to eat and drink and forces me to forgetfulness[221] of all I have suffered, and still she is urgent that I must fill her.[222] But you, when dawn tomorrow shows, see that you make speed[223] to set unhappy me once more on my own land, even[224] when I have much suffered; and let life leave me when I have once more[225] seen my property, my serving people, and my great high-roofed house.”[226] So he spoke, and they all approved his word and encouraged[227] convoy for the stranger, for what he said was fair and orderly;[228] but when they had made libation and drunk, each as much as his heart[229] desired, they went away each to his house to rest, and now[230] he, the great Odysseus, remained still in the palace,[231] and along with him were Arete and the godlike Alkinoös,[232] who sat by him, and the servants cleared away the dinner things.[233] Now it was white-armed Arete who began their discourse,[234] for she recognized the mantle and tunic when she saw them, splendid[235] clothes which she herself had made, with her serving women.[236] Now she spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[237] “Stranger and friend, I myself first have a question to ask you.[238] What man are you, and whence? And who was it gave you this clothing?[239] Did you not say that you came here ranging over the water?”[240] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[241] “It is a hard thing, O queen, to tell you without intermission,[242] all my troubles, since the gods of the sky have given me many.[243] But this now I will tell you in answer to the question you asked me.[244] There is an island, Ogygia. It lies in the water[245] far off. There the daughter of Atlas, subtle Kalypso,  p 371  [246] lives, with ordered hair, a dread goddess, and there is no one,[247] neither a god nor mortal person, who keeps her company.[248] It was unhappy I alone whom my destiny brought there[249] to her hearth, when Zeus with a gathered cast of the shining lightning[250] shattered my fast ship midway on the wine-blue water.[251] There all the rest of my excellent companions perished,[252] but I, catching in my arms the keel of the oarswept vessel,[253] was carried for nine days, and on the tenth in the black night[254] the gods brought me to the island Ogygia, where Kalypso[255] lives, with ordered hair, a dread goddess, and she received me[256] and loved me excessively and cared for me, and she promised[257] to make me an immortal and all my days to be ageless,[258] but never so could she win over the heart within me.[259] There seven years I remained fast, but forever was drenching[260] with tears that clothing, immortal stuff, Kalypso had given.[261] But when in the turning of time the eighth year had befallen me,[262] she herself told me to go and urged me to do it, whether[263] by a message from Zeus or whether her own mind turned within her,[264] and she sent me on my way on a jointed raft, and gave me[265] much, bread and sweet wine, and put immortal clothing upon me,[266] and sent a following wind to carry me, warm and easy.[267] Seventeen days I sailed, making my way over the water,[268] and on the eighteenth day there showed the shadowy mountains[269] of your own country, and the dear heart was happy within me;[270] but I was unlucky, and had much misery left to live with[271] still, what was driven upon me by the Earthshaker, Poseidon,[272] who hampered me from my way, letting loose the winds upon me,[273] and stirred up an unspeakable sea, nor did the surf swell[274] let me sail along on my raft, though groaning constantly.[275] For now the stormwind scattered it far and wide, and I now[276] made my way across the great gulf by swimming, until[277] the wind and the water carried me and drove me to your shore;[278] but there, had I tried to set foot on the land, the rough wave[279] would have dashed me against tall rocks in a place that was cheerless,[280] so I backed away and swam again, until I came to[281] a river, and this at last seemed to me to be the best place,[282] being bare of rocks, and there was even shelter from the wind there.[283] I came out and dropped, nursing a hold on life, and immortal[284] night came on. I went out and away from the sky-fallen river,[285] and went to sleep there among the bushes, piled in a covering[286] of leaves, and the god drifted an infinite sleep about me.[287] And there among the leaves, my heart exhausted with sorrow,[288] I slept nightlong, and into the dawn, and on to the noonday,[289] and the sun was losing its light, and then the sweet sleep released me.[290] Then I was aware of your daughter’s attendant women playing[291] on the beach, and she, looking like the goddesses, went there among them.[292] I supplicated her, nor did she fail of the right decision;[293] it was as you could never have hoped for a young person, so confronted,[294] to act, for always the younger people are careless. Also[295] she gave me food in plenty to eat, she gave me gleaming[296] wine, and a bath in the river. She also gave me this clothing.[297] Sorrowful as I am, all this is true I have told you.”  p 372  [298] Then in turn Alkinoös spoke to him and answered:[299] “My friend, here is one proper thought that my daughter was not[300] aware of, when she failed to bring you, with her attendants,[301] here to our house. It was she to whom you first came as suppliant.”[302] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[303] “Hero, do not for my sake find fault with your blameless daughter.[304] She did urge me to follow along with her serving maidens,[305] but I for embarrassment and dread was not willing, for fear[306] that something in this might stir your spirit to anger seeing us.[307] For we who are people upon this earth are jealous in judgment.”[308] Then in turn Alkinoös spoke to him and answered:[309] “Stranger, the inward heart in my breast is not of such a kind[310] as to be recklessly angry. Always moderation is better.[311] O father Zeus, Athene and Apollo, how I wish[312] that, being the man you are and thinking the way that I do,[313] you could have my daughter and be called my son-in-law, staying[314] here with me. I would dower you with a house and properties,[315] if you stayed by your own good will. Against that, no Phaiakian[316] shall detain you. Never may such be to Zeus father’s liking.[317] As for conveyance, so that you may be sure, I appoint it[318] for tomorrow, until which time giving way to slumber[319] you may rest, and they will sail in the calm, to bring you[320] back to your country and house and whatever else is dear to you,[321] even if this may be much further away than Euboia,[322] which those of our people who have seen it say is the farthest[323] away of all, at that time they carried fair-haired Rhadamanthys[324] on his way to visit Tityos the son of Gaia.[325] They went there, and without any strain they accomplished[326] the journey, and on the very same day they were back home with us.[327] You yourself will see and know in your mind how my ships[328] are best, and my young men for tossing up sea with the oarblade.”[329] So he spoke, and long-suffering great Odysseus was happy.[330] He spoke a word then in prayer and named him by name, saying:[331] “Father Zeus, may Alkonoös accomplish everything[332] of which he spoke, and so may he have imperishable glory[333] upon the grain-giving earth; and I come home to my country.”[334] So now these two were conversing thus with each other,[335] but Arete of the white arms told her attendant women[336] to make up a bed in the porch’s shelter and to lay upon it[337] fine underbedding of purple and spread blankets above it,[338] and fleecy robes to be an over-all covering. The maidservants[339] went forth from the main house, and in their hands held torches.[340] When they had set to work and presently had a firm bed made,[341] they came and stood beside Odysseus, and with words roused him:[342] “Up, stranger, so you can go to rest. Your bed is made for you.”[343] So they spoke, and the thought of sleeping was welcome to him.[344] Then long-suffering great Odysseus lay down and slept there[345] upon a corded bedstead in the echoing portico,[346] but Alkinoös went to bed in the inner room of the high house,[347] and at his side the lady his wife served as bedfellow.  p 373  book eight[1] Then when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[2] Alkinoös, the hallowed prince, rose up from his sleeping,[3] and the descendant of Zeus, Odysseus sacker of cities,[4] rose up, and Alkinoös, the hallowed prince, guided them[5] to the Phaiakians’ place of assembly, which was built for them[6] by the ships. They went and took their seats on the polished[7] stones together, but Pallas Athene went through the city,[8] likening herself to the herald of wise Alkinoös,[9] as she was devising the return of great-hearted Odysseus.[10] She would go and stand beside each man and speak a word to him:[11] “Come with me, leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel,[12] to the place of assembly, there to find out about the stranger[13] who is new-come to the house of wise Alkinoös, after[14] wandering on the great sea, and in shape he is like the immortals.”[15] So she spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man,[16] and quickly the place of assembly and seats were filled with people[17] who gathered there, and many wondered much as they looked on[18] the wise son of Laertes, and upon him Athene[19] drifted a magical grace about his head and his shoulders,[20] and made him taller for the eye to behold, and thicker,[21] so that he might be loved by all the Phaiakians, and to them[22] might be wonderful and respected, and might accomplish many[23] trials of strength by which the Phaiakians tested Odysseus.[24] But when they were assembled and all in one place together,[25] to them now Alkinoös spoke forth and addressed them:[26] “Hear me, you leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel,[27] while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.[28] Here is this stranger, I do not know who he is, come wandering[29] suppliant here to my house from the eastern or western people.[30] He urges conveyance, and entreats us for its assurance.[31] So let us, as we have done before, hasten to convey him,[32] for neither has any other man who has come to my house[33] stayed here grieving a long time for the matter of convoy.[34] Come then, let us drag a black ship down to the bright sea,[35] one sailing now for the first time, and have for it a selection[36] from the district, fifty-two young men, who have been the finest[37] before. Then, each man fastening his oar to the oarlock,[38] disembark, then come to my house and make yourselves busy[39] for a present feast, and I will make generous provision[40] for all. I say this to the young men, but also, you other[41] sceptered kings, come to me in my splendid dwelling,[42] so we can entertain the stranger guest in our palace.[43] Let none refuse; and summon also the inspired singer[44] Demodokos, for to him the god gave song surpassing[45] in power to please, whenever the spirit moves him to singing.”[46] So he spoke, and led the way, and the others followed,[47] as sceptered kings, but a herald went seeking the inspired singer,  p 374  [48] and also the fifty-two young men who had been selected[49] went, as he told them, along the beach of the barren salt sea.[50] But when they had come down to the sea, and where the ship was,[51] they dragged the black ship down to the deeper part of the water,[52] and in the black hull set the mast in place, and set sails,[53] and made the oars fast in the leather slings of the oarlocks[54] all in good order, and hoisted the white sails and set them.[55] They anchored her deep enough in the channel, and then themselves[56] made their way to the great house of wise Alkinoös,[57] and the porticoes and enclosures and rooms were filled with people[58] assembling, there were many men there, both old and young ones,[59] and for them Alkinoös made a sacrifice, twelve sheep, eight[60] pigs with shining tusks, and two drag-footed oxen.[61] These they skinned and prepared and made the lovely feast ready.[62] The herald came near, bringing with him the excellent singer[63] whom the Muse had loved greatly, and gave him both good and evil.[64] She reft him of his eyes, but she gave him the sweet singing[65] art. Pontonoös set a silver-studded chair out for him[66] in the middle of the feasters, propping it against a tall column,[67] and the herald hung the clear lyre on peg placed over[68] his head, and showed him how to reach up with his hands and take it[69] down, and set beside him a table and a fine basket.[70] and beside him a cup to drink whenever his spirit desired it.[71] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[72] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[73] the Muse stirred the singer to sing the famous actions[74] of men on that venture, whose fame goes up into the wide heaven,[75] the quarrel between Odysseus and Peleus’ son, Achilleus,[76] how these once contended, at the gods’ generous festival,[77] with words of violence, so that the lord of men, Agamemnon,[78] was happy in his heart that the best of the Achaians were quarreling;[79] for so in prophecy Phoibos Apollo had spoken to him[80] in sacred Pytho, when he had stepped across the stone doorstep[81] to consult; for now the beginning of evil rolled on, descending[82] on Trojans, and on Danaans, through the designs of great Zeus.[83] These things the famous singer sang for them, but Odysseus,[84] taking in his ponderous hands the great mantle dyed in[85] sea-purple, drew it over his head and veiled his fine features,[86] shamed for tears running down his face before the Phaiakians;[87] and every time the divine singer would pause in his singing,[88] he would take the mantle away from his head, and wipe the tears off,[89] and taking up a two-handled goblet would pour a libation[90] to the gods, but every time he began again, and the greatest[91] of the Phaiakians would urge him to sing, since they joyed in his stories,[92] Odysseus would cover his head again, and make lamentation.[93] There, shedding tears, he went unnoticed by all the others,[94] but Alkinoös alone understood what he did and noticed,[95] since he was sitting next him and heard him groaning heavily.[96] At once he spoke aloud to the oar-loving Phaiakians:[97] “Hear me, you leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel.[98] By this time we have filled our desire for the equal feasting[99] and for the lyre, which is the companion to the generous[100] feast. Now let us go outside and make our endeavor  p 375  [101] in all contests, so that our stranger can tell his friends, after[102] he reaches his home, by how much we surpass all others[103] in boxing, wrestling, leaping and speed of our feet for running.”[104] So he spoke, and led the way, and the rest went with him,[105] and the herald hung up the clear lyre on its peg, and taking[106] Demodokos by the hand he led him out of the palace[107] and set him on the start of the way, where all the other[108] best men of the Phaiakians went, to gaze at the contests.[109] They went to the place of assembly, with an endless multitude[110] following, and many and excellent young men stood forth.[111] Akroneos stood up, and Okyalos and Elatreus,[112] Nauteus and Prymneus, Anchialos and Eretmeus,[113] Ponteus and Proreus, Thoön and Anabesineos,[114] Amphialos, son of Polyneos, the son of Tekton,[115] and Euryalos stood up, Naubolos’ son, a man like murderous[116] Ares himself, and he was best of all the Phaiakians[117] in build and beauty, only except for stately Laodamas.[118] Also there stood forth three sons of stately Alkinoös,[119] Laodamas and Halios and godlike Klytoneos.[120] First of all they held a contest for speed in running.[121] The field strung out from the starting scratch, yet all at the same time[122] flew on together, turning up the dust of the plain. Of these[123] stately Klytoneos was far the best in the running,[124] and was out in front by the length of a furrow for mules plowing[125] a field, and came back first to the crowd, with the rest behind him.[126] Next these tried each other out in the painful wrestling,[127] and in this Euryalos surpassed all the best among them.[128] In the jump it was Amphialos who outdid all others,[129] while with the discus far the best of them was Elatreus,[130] and in boxing it was Alkinoös’ fine son, Laodamas.[131] But after all had enjoyed their hearts with athletic contests,[132] Laodamas the son of Alkinoös spoke forth among them:[133] “Come, friends, let us ask the stranger if he has skill and knowledge[134] for any kind of contest. In his build he is no mean man,[135] for the lower legs and thighs he has, and both arms above them,[136] for the massive neck and the great strength, nor is it that he lacks[137] youth, but the crush of many misfortunes has used him hardly.[138] For I say there is no other thing that is worse than the sea is[139] for breaking a man, even though he may be a very strong one.”[140] Then in turn Euryalos spoke forth and answered:[141] “Laodamas, this word you spoke was fair and orderly.[142] Go yourself then, and say it to him, and invite him to try it.”[143] Then when the excellent son of Alkinoös heard this answer,[144] he went and stood in the midst of them and spoke to Odysseus:[145] “Come you also now, father stranger, and try these contests,[146] if you have skill in any. It beseems you to know athletics,[147] for there is no greater glory that can befall a man living[148] than what he achieves by speed of his feet or strength of his hands. So[149] come then and try it, and scatter those cares that are on your spirit.[150] Your voyage will not be put off for long, but now already[151] your ship is hauled down to the sea, and your companions are ready.”[152] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[153] “Laodamas, why do you all urge me on in mockery  p 376  [154] to do these things? Cares are more in my mind than games are,[155] who before this have suffered much and had many hardships,[156] and sit here now in the middle of your assembly, longing[157] to go home, entreating your king for this, and all of his people.”[158] Euryalos answered him to his face and spoke to him roughly:[159] “No, stranger, for I do not see that you are like one versed[160] in contests, such as now are practiced much among people,[161] but rather to one who plies his ways in his many-locked vessel,[162] master over mariners who also are men of business,[163] a man who, careful of his cargo and grasping for profits,[164] goes carefully on his way. You do not resemble an athlete.”[165] Then looking at him darkly resourceful Odysseus answered:[166] “Friend, that was not well spoken; you seem like one who is reckless.[167] So it is that the gods do not bestow graces in all ways[168] on men, neither in stature nor yet in brains or eloquence;[169] for there is a certain kind of man, less noted for beauty,[170] but the god puts comeliness on his words, and they who look toward him[171] are filled with joy at the sight, and he speaks to them without faltering[172] in winning modesty, and shines among those who are gathered,[173] and people look on him as on a god when he walks in the city.[174] Another again in his appearance is like the immortals,[175] but upon his words there is no grace distilled, as in your case[176] the appearance is conspicuous, and not a god even[177] would make it otherwise, and yet the mind there is worthless.[178] Now you have stirred up anger deep in the breast within me[179] by this disorderly speaking, and I am not such a new hand[180] at games as you say, but always, as I think, I have been[181] among the best when I still had trust in youth and hands’ strength.[182] Now I am held in evil condition and pain; for I had much[183] to suffer; the wars of men; hard crossing of the big waters.[184] But even so for all my troubles I will try your contests,[185] for your word bit in the heart, and you have stirred me by speaking.”[186] He spoke, and with mantle still on sprang up and laid hold of a discus[187] that was a bigger and thicker one, heavier not by a little[188] than the one the Phaiakians had used for their sport in throwing.[189] He spun, and let this fly from his ponderous hand. The stone[190] hummed in the air, and the Phaiakians, men of long oars[191] and famed for seafaring, shrank down against the ground, ducking[192] under the flight of the stone which, speeding from his hand lightly,[193] overflew the marks of all others, and Athene, likening[194] herself to a man, marked down the cast and spoke and addressed him:[195] “Even a blind man, friend, would be able to distinguish your mark[196] by feeling for it, since it is not mingled with the common[197] lot, but far before. Have no fear over this contest.[198] No one of the Phaiakians will come up to this mark or pass it.”[199] She spoke, and much-enduring great Odysseus rejoiced, happy[200] to find one friendly companion in the assembled company.[201] Again he spoke to the Phaiakians, in language more blithe:[202] “Now reach me that mark, young men, and then I will make another[203] throw, as great as this, I think, or one even better.[204] Let any of the rest, whose heart and spirit are urgent for it,[205] come up and try me, since you have irritated me so, either  p 377  [206] at boxing or wrestling or in a foot race, I begrudge nothing;[207] any of the Phaiakians, that is, except Laodamas[208] himself, for he is my host; who would fight with his friend? Surely[209] any man can be called insensate and good for nothing[210] who in an alien community offers to challenge[211] his friend and host in the games. He damages what is his. No,[212] but I refuse not one of the rest, nor do I scorn him,[213] but I am willing to look in his eyes and be tested against him.[214] I am not bad in any of the contests where men strive.[215] I know well how to handle the polished bow, and would be[216] first to strike my man with an arrow aimed at a company[217] of hostile men, even though many companions were standing[218] close beside me, and all shooting with bows at the enemies.[219] There was Philoktetes alone who surpassed me in archery[220] when we Achaians shot with bows in the Trojan country.[221] But Twill say that I stand far out ahead of all others[222] such as are living mortals now and feed on the earth. Only[223] I will not set myself against men of the generations[224] before, not with Herakles nor Eurytos of Oichalia,[225] who set themselves against the immortals with the bow, and therefore[226] great Eurytos died suddenly nor came to an old age[227] in his own mansions, since Apollo in anger against him[228] killed him, because he had challenged Apollo in archery. I can[229] throw with the spear as far as another casts with an arrow.[230] Only in a foot race I fear one of the Phaiakians[231] might outpass me; I have been through too much and shamefully battered[232] on many rough seas, since there could be no orderly training[233] on shipboard; because of this my legs have lost their condition.”[234] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.[235] Only Alkinoös spoke up and gave him an answer:[236] “My friend, since it is not graceless for you to speak thus among us,[237] but you are willing to show that excellence you are endowed with,[238] angered because this man came up to you in our assembly[239] and belittled you, in a way no man would properly find fault[240] with your excellence, if he knew in his heart how to speak sensibly:[241] come then, attend to what I say, so that you can tell it[242] even to some other hero after this, when in your palace[243] you sit at the feasting with your own wife and children beside you,[244] remembering our excellence and what Zeus has established[245] as our activities, through time, from the days of our fathers.[246] For we are not perfect in our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers,[247] but we do run lightly on our feet, and are excellent seamen,[248] and always the feast is dear to us, and the lyre and dances[249] and changes of clothing and our hot baths and beds. Come then,[250] you who among all the Phaiakians are the best dancers,[251] do your dance, so that our guest, after he comes home[252] to his own people, can tell them how far we surpass all others[253] in our seamanship and the speed of our feet and dancing and singing.[254] Let someone go quickly and bring Demodokos his clear-voiced[255] lyre, which must have been set down somewhere in our palace.”[256] So godlike Alkinoös spoke, and the herald rose up[257] to bring the hollowed lyre out of the king’s house, and now  p 378  [258] stewards of the course stood up, nine in all of them, chosen[259] out of the people, who on every occasion set in good order[260] the grounds for games, and they smoothed the dancing floor and set right[261] all the ground, and the herald came bringing with him the clear lyre[262] for Demodokos, who moved into the middle, and about him stood forth[263] young men in the first of their youth, well trained in dancing,[264] and beat the wonderful dancing floor with their feet. Odysseus[265] gazed on the twinkling of their feet, his heart full of wonder.[266] Demodokos struck the lyre and began singing well the story[267] about the love of Ares and sweet-garlanded Aphrodite,[268] how they first lay together in the house of Hephaistos[269] secretly; he gave her much and fouled the marriage[270] and bed of the lord Hephaistos; to him there came as messenger[271] Helios, the sun, who had seen them lying in love together.[272] Hephaistos, when he had heard the heartsore story of it,[273] went on his way to his smithy, heart turbulent with hard sorrows,[274] and set the great anvil upon its stand, and hammered out fastenings[275] that could not be slipped or broken, to hold them fixed in position.[276] Now when, in his anger against Ares, he had made this treacherous[277] snare, he went to his chamber where his own dear bed lay,[278] and spun his fastenings around the posts from every direction,[279] while many more were suspended overhead, from the roof beams,[280] thin, like spider webs, which not even one of the blessed[281] gods could see. He had fashioned it to be very deceptive.[282] But when he had spun about the bedstead all of his treacherous[283] device, he started for Lemnos, the strong-founded citadel,[284] which, of all territories on earth, was far dearest to him.[285] Nor did Ares of the golden reins keep a blind watch on him,[286] as he saw Hephaistos the glorious smith go away, but he then[287] took his course so he entered the house of glorious Hephaistos,[288] lusting after the love of sweet-garlanded Kythereia.[289] She had lately come in from the house of her father, the powerful[290] son of Kronos, and sat there when Ares entered the house. Then[291] he took her by the hand and spoke to her and named her, saying:[292] “Come, my dear, let us take our way to the bed, and lie there,[293] for Hephaistos is no longer hereabouts, but by this time[294] he must have come to Lemnos and the wild-spoken Sintians.”[295] So he spoke, and she was well pleased to sleep with him. These two[296] went to bed, and slept there, and all about them were bending[297] the artful bonds that had been forged by subtle Hephaistos,[298] so neither of them could stir a limb or get up, and now[299] they saw the truth, and there was no longer a way out for them.[300] The glorious smith of the strong arms came and stood near. He had[301] turned back on his way, before ever reaching the Lemnian country,[302] for Helios had kept watch for him, and told him the story.[303] He took his way back to his own house, heart grieved within him,[304] and stood there in the forecourt, with the savage anger upon him,[305] and gave out a terrible cry and called to all the immortals:[306] “Father Zeus and all you other blessed immortal[307] gods, come here, to see a ridiculous sight, no seemly[308] matter, how Aphrodite daughter of Zeus forever[309] holds me in little favor, but she loves ruinous Ares  p 379  [310] because he is handsome, and goes sound on his feet, while I am[311] misshapen from birth, and for this I hold no other responsible[312] but my own father and mother, and I wish they never had got me.[313] Now look and see, where these two have gone to bed and lie there[314] in love together. I am sickened when I look at them, and yet[315] I think they will not go on lying thus even for a little,[316] much though they are in love, I think they will have no wish[317] for sleeping, but then my fastenings and my snare will contain them[318] until her father pays back in full all my gifts of courtship[319] I paid out into his hand for the sake of his bitch-eyed daughter.[320] The girl is beautiful indeed, but she is intemperate.”[321] So he spoke, and the gods gathered to the house with the brazen[322] floor. Poseidon came, the shaker of the earth, and the kindly[323] Hermes came, and the lord who works from afar, Apollo,[324] but the female gods remained each at her home, for modesty.[325] The gods, the givers of good things, stood there in the forecourt,[326] and among the blessed immortals uncontrollable laughter[327] went up as they saw the handiwork of subtle Hephaistos.[328] And thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the god next him:[329] “No virtue in bad dealings. See, the slow one has overtaken[330] the swift, as now slow Hephaistos has overtaken[331] Ares, swiftest of all the gods on Olympos, by artifice,[332] though he was lame, and Ares must pay the adulterer’s damage.”[333] This was the way of the gods as they conversed with each other,[334] but the lord Apollo son of Zeus said a word to Hermes:[335] “Hermes, son of Zeus, guide and giver of good things, tell me,[336] would you, caught tight in these strong fastenings, be willing[337] to sleep in bed by the side of Aphrodite the golden?”[338] Then in turn the courier Argeïphontes answered:[339] “Lord who strike from afar, Apollo, I wish it could only[340] be, and there could be thrice this number of endless fastenings,[341] and all you gods could be looking on and all the goddesses,[342] and still I would sleep by the side of Aphrodite the golden.”[343] He spoke, and there was laughter among the immortals, only[344] there was no laughter for Poseidon, but he kept entreating[345] Hephaistos, the famous craftsman, asking him to set Ares[346] free, and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[347] “Let him go, and I guarantee he will pay whatever[348] you ask, all that is approved among the immortal deities.”[349] Then in turn the renowned smith of the strong arms answered:[350] “Shaker of the earth, Poseidon, do not urge this on me.[351] The business of wretches is wretched even in guarantee giving.[352] To what could I hold you among the immortal gods, if Ares[353] were to go off, avoiding both his debt and his bondage?”[354] Then in turn Poseidon, shaker of the earth, answered:[355] “Hephaistos, if Ares goes off and escapes, not paying[356] anything he may owe you, then I myself will pay it.”[357] Then in turn the renowned smith of the strong arms answered:[358] “It cannot be, and it is not right, that I should deny you.”[359] So mighty Hephaistos spoke and undid the fastenings. Straightway[360] the two of them, when they were set free of the fastening, though it[361] was so strong, sprang up, and Ares took his way Thraceward,  p 380  [362] while she, Aphrodite lover of laughter, went back to Paphos[363] on Cyprus, where lies her sacred precinct and her smoky altar,[364] and there the Graces bathed her and anointed her with ambrosial[365] oil, such as abounds for the gods who are everlasting,[366] and put delightful clothing about her, a wonder to look on.[367] So the famous singer sang his song, and Odysseus[368] enjoyed it in his heart as he listened, as did the others[369] there, Phaiakians, men of the long oar, famed for seafaring.[370] Then Alkinoös asked Halios and Laodamas to dance[371] all by themselves, since there was none to challenge them. These two,[372] after they had taken up in their hands the ball, a beautiful[373] thing, red, which Polybos the skillful craftsman had made them,[374] one of them, bending far back, would throw it up to the shadowy[375] clouds, and the other, going high off the ground, would easily[376] catch it again, before his feet came back to the ground. Then[377] after they had played their game with the ball thrown upward,[378] these two performed a dance on the generous earth, with rapid[379] interchange of position, and the rest of the young men standing[380] about the field stamped out the time, and a great sound rose up.[381] Then great Odysseus spoke a word to Alkinoös, saying:[382] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[383] truly, as you boasted your people were the best dancers,[384] so it is done before me. Wonder takes me as I look on them.”[385] He spoke, and Alkinoös the hallowed king was pleased,[386] and at once he Spoke aloud to the oar-loving Phaiakians:[387] “Hear me, leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel.[388] I think this stranger is a man of discretion. Therefore[389] come, let us give him a gift of friendship, as is becoming.[390] For here are twelve who are marked out as kings in our country[391] with power, and they act as leaders, and I myself am the thirteenth.[392] Then let each of you who are such contribute a well-washed[393] robe, and a tunic, and a talent of precious gold. Then[394] we shall assemble it all together, so that our stranger[395] may have it in his hands and be pleased as he goes in to supper.[396] But Euryalos shall make amends to him with a spoken[397] word and a gift, for having spoken out of due measure.”[398] So he spoke, and they all approved what he said and urged it,[399] and each one sent his herald away to bring the gifts back.[400] Then Euryalos spoke in his turn and answered Alkinoös:[401] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[402] certainly I will make amends to our guest, as you urge me.[403] I will give him this sword, which is all bronze, but the handle[404] on it is silver, and there is a scabbard of fresh-sawn ivory[405] cut in rings to hold it. He will find that it is of great value.”[406] So he spoke, and put the sword with the nails of silver[407] into his hands, and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words:[408] “Farewell, father and stranger, and if any word was let slip[409] that was improper, may the stormwinds catch it away and carry it[410] off, and the gods grant you safe homecoming to your own country[411] and wife; since here, far from your own people, you must be suffering.”[412] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[413] “Farewell also to you, dear friend, and may the gods grant you  p 381  [414] prosperity; may you never miss this sword you have given[415] me now, as a gift, and made amends to me with words spoken.”[416] So he spoke, and slung the sword with the nails of silver[417] over his shoulder. The sun went down, and the glorious presents[418] came in, carried by the proud heralds of Alkinoös,[419] and these, surpassingly lovely gifts, the sons of Alkinoös[420] took over, and set them down beside their respected mother.[421] Now Alkinoös the hallowed king was their leader,[422] and all of them went into the house and sat on their high thrones.[423] Thereupon the king Alkinoös said to Arete:[424] “Come, wife, bring out a magnificent coffer, the best one you have,[425] and in it yourself lay a robe that is newly washed, and a tunic.[426] Then warm a brazen caldron over the fire, and heat water[427] for this man, so he may bathe and then see, all set out in order,[428] the presents which the stately Phaiakians brought here to give him,[429] and rejoice in the feast and in listening to the song of the singer.[430] I myself make him a present of this surpassingly lovely[431] golden cup, so that all his days he may remember me[432] as he makes libation at home to Zeus and the other immortals.”[433] So he spoke, and Arete going to her maidservants told them[434] to set the great caldron over the fire, as quickly as might be,[435] and they set the tripod for the bathwater over the blazing[436] fire, and poured in the water and gathered kindling and lit it.[437] The fire worked on the belly of the caldron, the water heated.[438] Meanwhile Arete brought from out of her chamber the splendid[439] chest for the stranger, and in it laid the beautiful presents,[440] the clothing and the gold which the Phaiakians had given,[441] and she herself put in a robe, and a handsome tunic,[442] and spoke to the stranger and addressed him in winged words, saying:[443] “You yourself must see to the cover and nimbly fasten[444] a knot, so none may break in, while on your journey[445] you rest in a pleasant sleep as you go your ways in the black ship.”[446] When long-suffering great Odysseus had heard this, straightway[447] he made the covering tight upon it and fastened it nimbly[448] with an intricate knot, whose knowledge the lady Circe had taught him.[449] Then the housekeeper told him without delay to enter[450] the tub for his bath, and he with joy in his heart looked on[451] the hot water, for he had not been used to be so looked after[452] in the time since he had left the house of fair-haired Kalypso,[453] though in that time he had been looked after as if he were truly[454] a god. When the maids had bathed him and anointed him with oil,[455] they put a lovely mantle and a tunic about him,[456] and he stepped from the bath and went to join the men at their wine[457] drinking. Then Nausikaa, with the gods’ loveliness on her,[458] stood beside the pillar that supported the roof with its joinery,[459] and gazed upon Odysseus with all her eyes and admired him,[460] and spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words, saying:[461] “Goodbye, stranger, and think of me sometimes when you are[462] back at home, how I was the first you owed your life to.”[463] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[464] “Nausikaa, daughter of great-hearted Alkinoös,[465] even so may Zeus, high-thundering husband of Hera,  p 382  [466] grant me to reach my house and see my day of homecoming.[467] So even when I am there I will pray to you, as to a goddess,[468] all the days of my life. For, maiden, my life was your gift.”[469] He spoke, and went to sit on a chair by the king Alkinoös.[470] And now they were serving out the portions and mixing the wine, as[471] the herald came near, bringing with him the excellent singer[472] Demodokos, prized among the people, and set a chair for him[473] in the middle of the feasters, propping it against a tall column.[474] Resourceful Odysseus called the herald over and spoke to him,[475] but first he cut a piece from the loin of the pig with shining[476] teeth, with most of the meat left on, and edged with rich fat:[477] “Here, herald, take this piece of meat to Demodokos so that[478] he may eat, and I, though a sorry man, embrace him.[479] For with all peoples upon the earth singers are entitled[480] to be cherished and to their share of respect, since the Muse has taught them[481] her own way, and since she loves all the company of singers.”[482] So he spoke, and the herald took the portion and placed it[483] in the hands of the hero Demodokos, who received it happily.[484] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[485] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[486] Odysseus the resourceful spoke to Demodokos, saying:[487] “Demodokos, above all mortals beside I prize you.[488] Surely the Muse, Zeus’ daughter or else Apollo has taught you,[489] for all too right following the tale you sing the Achaians’[490] venture, all they did and had done to them, all the sufferings[491] of these Achaians, as if you had been there yourself or heard it[492] from one who was. Come to another part of the story, sing us[493] the wooden horse, which Epeios made with Athene helping,[494] the stratagem great Odysseus filled once with men and brought it[495] to the upper city, and it was these men who sacked Ilion.[496] If you can tell me the course of all these things as they happened,[497] I will speak of you before all mankind, and tell them[498] how freely the goddess gave you the magical gift of singing.”[499] He spoke, and the singer, stirred by the goddess, began, and showed them[500] his song, beginning from where the Argives boarded their well-benched[501] ships, and sailed away, after setting fire to their shelters;[502] but already all these others who were with famous Odysseus[503] were sitting hidden in the horse, in the place where the Trojans assembled,[504] for the Trojans themselves had dragged it up to the height of the city,[505] and now it was standing there, and the Trojans seated around it[506] talked endlessly, and three ways of thought found favor, either[507] to take the pitiless bronze to it and hack open the hollow[508] horse, or drag it to the cliffs’ edge and topple it over,[509] or let it stand where it was as a dedication to blandish[510] the gods, and this last way was to be the end of it, seeing[511] that the city was destined to be destroyed when it had inside it[512] the great horse made of wood, with all the best of Argives[513] sitting within and bearing death and doom for the Trojans.[514] He sang then how the sons of the Achaians left their hollow[515] hiding place and streamed from the horse and sacked the city,[516] and he sang how one and another fought through the steep citadel,[517] and how in particular Odysseus went, with godlike  p 383  [518] Menelaos, like Ares, to find the house of Deïphobos,[519] and there, he said, he endured the grimmest fighting that ever[520] he had, but won it there too, with great-hearted Athene aiding.[521] So the famous singer sang his tale, but Odysseus[522] melted, and from under his eyes the tears ran down, drenching[523] his cheeks. As a woman weeps, lying over the body[524] of her dear husband, who fell fighting for her city and people[525] as he tried to beat off the pitiless day from city and children;[526] she sees him dying and gasping for breath, and winding her body[527] about him she cries high and shrill, while the men behind her,[528] hitting her with their spear butts on the back and the shoulders,[529] force her up and lead her away into slavery, to have[530] hard work and sorrow, and her cheeks are wracked with pitiful weeping.[531] Such were the pitiful tears Odysseus shed from under[532] his brows, but they went unnoticed by all the others,[533] but Alkinoös alone understood what he did and noticed,[534] since he was sitting next him and heard him groaning heavily.[535] At once he spoke aloud to the oar-loving Phaiakians:[536] “Hear me, you leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel.[537] Let Demodokos now give over his loud lyre playing,[538] since it cannot be that he pleases all alike with this song.[539] Ever since we ate our supper and the divine singer[540] began, our guest has never ceased since then his sorry[541] lament. Great sorrow must have come on his heart, surely.[542] But let him hold now, so that all of us, guest receivers[543] and guest alike, may enjoy ourselves. This is the better way,[544] seeing that all this has been done for the sake of our honored[545] guest, this escort, these loving gifts we give him for friendship.[546] For any man whose wits have hold on the slightest achievement,[547] his suppliant and guest is as good as a brother to him.[548] So do not longer keep hiding now with crafty purposes[549] the truth of what I ask you. It is better to speak out.[550] Tell me the name by which your mother and father called you[551] in that place, and how the rest who live in the city about you[552] call you. No one among all the peoples, neither base man[553] nor noble, is altogether nameless, once he has been born,[554] but always his parents as soon as they bring him forth put upon him[555] a name. Tell me your land, your neighborhood and your city,[556] so that our ships, straining with their own purpose, can carry you[557] there, for there are no steersmen among the Phaiakians, neither[558] are there any steering oars for them, such as other ships have,[559] but the ships themselves understand men’s thoughts and purposes,[560] and they know all the cities of men and all their fertile[561] fields, and with greatest speed they cross the gulf of the salt sea,[562] huddled under a mist and cloud, nor is there ever[563] any fear that they may suffer damage or come to destruction.[564] Yet this I have heard once on a time from my father, Nausithoös[565] who said it, and told me how Poseidon would yet be angry[566] with us, because we are convoy without hurt to all men.[567] He said that one day, as a well-made ship of Phaiakian[568] men came back from a convoy on the misty face of the water,[569] he would stun it, and pile a great mountain over our city, to hide it.  p 384  [570] So the old man spoke, and the god might either bring it[571] to pass, or it might be left undone, as the god’s heart pleases.[572] So come now tell me this and give me an accurate answer:[573] Where you were driven off your course, what countries peopled[574] by men you came to, the men themselves and their strong-founded[575] cities, and which were savage and violent, and without justice,[576] and which were hospitable and with a godly mind for strangers.[577] And tell me why you weep in your heart and make lamentation[578] when you hear of the Argives’ and the Danaans’ venture, and hear[579] of Ilion. The gods did this, and spun the destruction[580] of peoples, for the sake of the singing of men hereafter.[581] Was there perhaps some kinsman by marriage, wife’s father or brother,[582] a brave man who perished before Ilion? Such are the relatives[583] who next to a man’s own blood and kin come closest to him?[584] Or could it then have been some companion, a brave man knowing[585] thoughts gracious toward you, since one who is your companion, and has thoughts[586] honorable toward you, is of no less degree than a brother?”book nine[1] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[2] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[3] surely indeed it is a good thing to listen to a singer[4] such as this one before us, who is like the gods in his singing;[5] for I think there is no occasion accomplished that is more pleasant[6] than when festivity holds sway among all the populace,[7] and the feasters up and down the houses are sitting in order[8] and listening to the singer, and beside them the tables are loaded[9] with bread and meats, and from the mixing bowl the wine steward[10] draws the wine and carries it about and fills the cups. This[11] seems to my own mind to be the best of occasions.[12] But now your wish was inclined to ask me about my mournful[13] sufferings, so that I must mourn and grieve even more. What then[14] shall I recite to you first of all, what leave till later?[15] Many are the sorrows the gods of the sky have given me.[16] Now first I will tell you my name, so that all of you[17] may know me, and I hereafter, escaping the day without pity,[18] be your friend and guest, though the home where I live is far away from you.[19] I am Odysseus son of Laertes, known before all men[20] for the study of crafty designs, and my fame goes up to the heavens.[21] I am at home in sunny Ithaka. There is a mountain[22] there that stands tall, leaf-trembling Neritos, and there are islands[23] settled around it, lying one very close to another.[24] There is Doulichion and Same, wooded Zakynthos,[25] but my island lies low and away, last of all on the water[26] toward the dark, with the rest below facing east and sunshine,[27] a rugged place, but a good nurse of men; for my part[28] I cannot think of any place sweeter on earth to look at.[29] For in truth Kalypso, shining among divinities, kept me[30] with her in her hollow caverns, desiring me for her husband,  p 385  [31] and so likewise Aiaian Circe the guileful detained me[32] beside her in her halls, desiring me for her husband,[33] but never could she persuade the heart within me. So it is[34] that nothing is more sweet in the end than country and parents[35] ever, even when far away one lives in a fertile[36] place, when it is in alien country, far from his parents.[37] But come, I will tell you of my voyage home with its many[38] troubles, which Zeus inflicted on me as I came from Troy land.[39] “From Ilion the wind took me and drove me ashore at Ismaros[40] by the Kikonians. I sacked their city and killed their people,[41] and out of their city taking their wives and many possessions[42] we shared them out, so none might go cheated of his proper[43] portion. There I was for the light foot and escaping,[44] and urged it, but they were greatly foolish and would not listen,[45] and then and there much wine was being drunk, and they slaughtered[46] many sheep on the beach, and lumbering horn-curved cattle.[47] But meanwhile the Kikonians went and summoned the other[48] Kikonians, who were their neighbors living in the inland country,[49] more numerous and better men, well skilled in fighting[50] men with horses, but knowing too at need the battle[51] on foot. They came at early morning, like flowers in season[52] or leaves, and the luck that came our way from Zeus was evil,[53] to make us unfortunate, so we must have hard pains to suffer.[54] Both sides stood and fought their battle there by the running[55] ships, and with bronze-headed spears they cast at each other,[56] and as long as it was early and the sacred daylight increasing,[57] so long we stood fast and fought them off, though there were more of them;[58] but when the sun had gone to the time for unyoking of cattle,[59] then at last the Kikonians turned the Achaians back and beat them,[60] and out of each ship six of my strong-greaved companions[61] were killed, but the rest of us fled away from death and destruction.[62] “From there we sailed on further along, glad to have escaped death,[63] but grieving still at heart for the loss of our dear companions.[64] Even then I would not suffer the flight of my oarswept vessels[65] until a cry had been made three times for each of my wretched[66] companions, who dies there in the plain, killed by the Kikonians.[67] Cloud-gathering Zeus drove the North Wind against our vessels[68] in a supernatural storm, and huddled under the cloud scuds[69] land alike and the great water. Night sprang from heaven.[70] The ships were swept along yawing down the current; the violence[71] of the wind ripped our sails into three and four pieces. These then,[72] in fear of destruction, we took down and stowed in the ships’ hulls,[73] and rowed them on ourselves until we had made the mainland.[74] There for two nights and two days together we lay up,[75] for pain and weariness together eating our hearts out.[76] But when the fair-haired Dawn in her rounds brought on the third day,[77] we, setting the masts upright, and hoisting the white sails on them,[78] sat still, and let the wind and the steersmen hold them steady.[79] And now I would have come home unscathed to the land of my fathers,[80] but as I turned the hook of Maleia, the sea and current[81] and the North Wind beat me off course, and drove me on past Kythera.[82] “Nine days then I was swept along by the force of the hostile  p 386  [83] winds on the fishy sea, but on the tenth day we landed[84] in the country of the Lotus-Eaters, who live on a flowering[85] food, and there we set foot on the mainland, and fetched water,[86] and my companions soon took their supper there by the fast ships.[87] But after we had tasted of food and drink, then I sent[88] some of my companions ahead, telling them to find out[89] what men, eaters of bread, might live here in this country.[90] I chose two men, and sent a third with them, as a herald.[91] My men went on and presently met the Lotus-Eaters,[92] nor did these Lotus-Eaters have any thoughts of destroying[93] our companions, but they only gave them lotus to taste of.[94] But any of them who ate the honey-sweet fruit of lotus[95] was unwilling to take any message back, or to go[96] away, but they wanted to stay there with the lotus-eating[97] people, feeding on lotus, and forget the way home. I myself[98] took these men back weeping, by force, to where the ships were,[99] and put them aboard under the rowing benches and tied them[100] fast, then gave the order to the rest of my eager[101] companions to embark on the ships in haste, for fear[102] someone else might taste of the lotus and forget the way home,[103] and the men quickly went aboard and sat to the oarlocks,[104] and sitting well in order dashed the oars in the gray sea.[105] “From there, grieving still at heart, we sailed on further[106] along, and reached the country of the lawless outrageous[107] Cyclopes who, putting all their trust in the immortal[108] gods, neither plow with their hands nor plant anything,[109] but all grows for them without seed planting, without cultivation,[110] wheat and barley and also the grapevines, which yield for them[111] wine of strength, and it is Zeus’ rain that waters it for them.[112] These people have no institutions, no meetings for counsels;[113] rather they make their habitations in caverns hollowed[114] among the peaks of the high mountains, and each one is the law[115] for his own wives and children, and cares nothing about the others.[116] “There is a wooded island that spreads, away from the harbor,[117] neither close in to the land of the Cyclopes nor far out[118] from it; forested; wild goats beyond number breed there,[119] for there is no coming and going of human kind to disturb them,[120] nor are they visited by hunters, who in the forest[121] suffer hardships as they haunt the peaks of the mountains,[122] neither again is it held by herded flocks, nor farmers,[123] but all its days, never plowed up and never planted,[124] it goes without people and supports the bleating wild goats.[125] For the Cyclopes have no ships with cheeks of vermilion,[126] nor have they builders of ships among them, who could have made them[127] strong-benched vessels, and these if made could have run them sailings[128] to all the various cities of men, in the way that people[129] cross the sea by means of ships and visit each other,[130] and they could have made this island a strong settlement for them.[131] For it is not a bad place at all, it could bear all crops[132] in season, and there are meadow lands near the shores of the gray sea,[133] well watered and soft; there could be grapes grown there endlessly,[134] and there is smooth land for plowing, men could reap a full harvest  p 387  [135] always in season, since there is very rich subsoil. Also[136] there is an easy harbor, with no need for a hawser[137] nor anchor stones to be thrown ashore nor cables to make fast;[138] one could just run ashore and wait for the time when the sailors’[139] desire stirred them to go and the right winds were blowing.[140] Also at the head of the harbor there runs bright water,[141] spring beneath rock, and there are black poplars growing around it.[142] There we sailed ashore, and there was some god guiding[143] us in through the gloom of the night, nothing showed to look at,[144] for there was a deep mist around the ships, nor was there any moon[145] showing in the sky, but she was under the clouds and hidden.[146] There was none of us there whose eyes had spied out the island,[147] and we never saw any long waves rolling in and breaking[148] on the shore, but the first thing was when we beached the well-benched vessels.[149] Then after we had beached the ships we took all the sails down,[150] and we ourselves stepped out onto the break of the sea beach,[151] and there we fell asleep and waited for the divine Dawn.[152] “But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[153] we made a tour about the island, admiring everything[154] there, and the nymphs, daughters of Zeus of the aegis, started[155] the hill-roving goats our way for my companions to feast on.[156] At once we went and took from the ships curved bows and javelins[157] with long sockets, and arranging ourselves in three divisions[158] cast about, and the god granted us the game we longed for.[159] Now there were twelve ships that went with me, and for each one nine goats[160] were portioned out, but I alone had ten for my portion.[161] So for the whole length of the day until the sun’s setting,[162] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine;[163] for the red wine had not yet given out in the ships, there was[164] some still left, for we all had taken away a great deal[165] in storing jars when we stormed the Kikonians’ sacred citadel.[166] We looked across at the land of the Cyclopes, and they were[167] near by, and we saw their smoke and heard sheep and goats bleating.[168] But when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[169] then we lay down to sleep along the break of the seashore;[170] but when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[171] then I held an assembly and spoke forth before all:[172] ‘The rest of you, who are my eager companions, wait here,[173] while I, with my own ship and companions that are in it,[174] go and find out about these people, and learn what they are,[175] whether they are savage and violent, and without justice,[176] or hospitable to strangers and with minds that are godly.’[177] “So speaking I went aboard the ship and told my companions[178] also to go aboard, and to cast off the stern cables,[179] and quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks,[180] and sitting well in order dashed the oars in the gray sea.[181] But when we had arrived at the place, which was nearby, there[182] at the edge of the land we saw the cave, close to the water,[183] high, and overgrown with laurels, and in it were stabled[184] great flocks, sheep and goats alike, and there was a fenced yard[185] built around it with a high wall of grubbed-out boulders  p 388  [186] and tall pines and oaks with lofty foliage. Inside[187] there lodged a monster of a man, who now was herding[188] the flocks at a distance away, alone, for he did not range with[189] others, but stayed away by himself; his mind was lawless,[190] and in truth he was a monstrous wonder made to behold, not[191] like a man, an eater of bread, but more like a wooded[192] peak of the high mountains seen standing away from the others.[193] “At that time I told the rest of my eager companions[194] to stay where they were beside the ship and guard it. Meanwhile[195] I, choosing out the twelve best men among my companions,[196] went on, but I had with me a goatskin bottle of black wine,[197] sweet wine, given me by Maron, son of Euanthes[198] and priest of Apollo, who bestrides Ismaros; he gave it[199] because, respecting him with his wife and child, we saved them[200] from harm. He made his dwelling among the trees of the sacred[201] grove of Phoibos Apollo, and he gave me glorious presents.[202] He gave me seven talents of well-wrought gold, and he gave me[203] a mixing bowl made all of silver, and gave along with it[204] wine, drawing it off in storing jars, twelve in all. This was[205] a sweet wine, unmixed, a divine drink. No one of his servants[206] or thralls that were in his household knew anything about it,[207] but only himself and his dear wife and a single housekeeper.[208] Whenever he drank this honey-sweet red wine, he would pour out[209] enough to fill one cup, then twenty measures of water[210] were added, and the mixing bowl gave off a sweet smell;[211] magical; then would be no pleasure in holding off. Of this[212] wine I filled a great wineskin full, and took too provisions[213] in a bag, for my proud heart had an idea that presently[214] I would encounter a man who was endowed with great strength,[215] and wild, with no true knowledge of laws or any good customs.[216] “Lightly we made our way to the cave, but we did not find him[217] there, he was off herding on the range with his fat flocks.[218] We went inside the cave and admired everything inside it.[219] Baskets were there, heavy with cheeses, and the pens crowded[220] with lambs and kids. They had all been divided into separate[221] groups, the firstlings in one place, and then the middle ones,[222] the babies again by themselves. And all his vessels, milk pails[223] and pans, that he used for milking into, were running over[224] with whey. From the start my companions spoke to me and begged me[225] to take some of the cheeses, come back again, and the next time[226] to drive the lambs and kids from their pens, and get back quickly[227] to the ship again, and go sailing off across the salt water;[228] but I would not listen to them, it would have been better their way,[229] not until I could see him, see if he would give me presents.[230] My friends were to find the sight of him in no way lovely.[231] “There we built a fire and made sacrifice, and helping[232] ourselves to the cheeses we ate and sat waiting for him[233] inside, until he came home from his herding. He carried a heavy[234] load of dried-out wood, to make a fire for his dinner,[235] and threw it down inside the cave, making a terrible[236] crash, so in fear we scuttled away into cave’s corners.[237] Next he drove into the wide cavern all from the fat flocks  p 389  [238] that he would milk, but he left all the male animals, billygoats[239] and rams, outside in his yard with the deep fences. Next thing,[240] he heaved up and set into position the huge door stop,[241] a massive thing; no twenty-two of the best four-wheeled[242] wagons could have taken that weight off the ground and carried it,[243] such a piece of sky-towering cliff that was he set over[244] his gateway. Next he sat down and milked his sheep and his bleating[245] goats, each of them in order, and put lamb or kid under each one[246] to suck, and then drew off half of the white milk and put it[247] by in baskets made of wickerwork, stored for cheeses,[248] but let the other half stand in the milk pails so as to have it[249] to help himself to and drink from, and it would serve for his supper.[250] But after he had briskly done all his chores and finished,[251] at last he lit the fire, and saw us, and asked us a question:[252] ‘Strangers, who are you? From where do you come sailing over the watery[253] ways? Is it on some business, or are you recklessly roving[254] as pirates do, when they sail on the salt sea and venture[255] their lives as they wander, bringing evil to alien people?’[256] “So he spoke, and the inward heart in us was broken[257] in terror of the deep voice and for seeing him so monstrous;[258] but even so I had words for an answer, and I said to him:[259] ‘We are Achaians coming from Troy, beaten off our true course[260] by winds from every direction across the great gulf of the open[261] sea, making for home, by the wrong way, on the wrong courses.[262] So we have come. So it has pleased Zeus to arrange it.[263] We claim we are of the following of the son of Atreus,[264] Agamemnon, whose fame now is the greatest thing under heaven,[265] such a city that he sacked and destroyed so many[266] people; but now in turn we come to you and are suppliants[267] at your knees, if you might give us a guest present or otherwise[268] some gift of grace, for such is the right of strangers. Therefore[269] respect the gods, O best of men. We are your suppliants,[270] and Zeus the guest god, who stands behind all strangers with honors[271] due them, avenges any wrong toward strangers and suppliants.’[272] “So I spoke, but he answered me in pitiless spirit:[273] ‘Stranger, you are a simple fool, or come from far off,[274] when you tell me to avoid the wrath of the gods or fear them.[275] The Cyclopes do not concern themselves over Zeus of the aegis,[276] nor any of the rest of the blessed gods, since we are far better[277] than they, and for fear of the hate of Zeus I would not spare[278] you or your companions either, if the fancy took me[279] otherwise. But tell me, so I may know: where did you[280] put your well-made ship when you came? Nearby or far off?’[281] “So he spoke, trying me out, but I knew too much and was not[282] deceived, but answered him in turn, and my words were crafty:[283] ‘Poseidon, Shaker of the Earth, has shattered my vessel.[284] He drove it against the rocks on the outer coast of your country,[285] cracked on a cliff, it is gone, the wind on the sea took it;[286] but I, with these you see, got away from sudden destruction.’[287] “So I spoke, but he in pitiless spirit answered[288] nothing, but sprang up and reached for my companions,[289] caught up two together and slapped them, like killing puppies,  p 390  [290] against the ground, and the brains ran all over the floor, soaking[291] the ground. Then he cut them up limb by limb and got supper ready,[292] and like a lion reared in the hills, without leaving anything,[293] ate them, entrails, flesh and the marrowy bones alike. We[294] cried out aloud and held our hands up to Zeus, seeing[295] the cruelty of what he did, but our hearts were helpless.[296] But when the Cyclops had filled his enormous stomach, feeding[297] on human flesh and drinking down milk unmixed with water,[298] he lay down to sleep in the cave sprawled out through his sheep. Then I[299] took counsel with myself in my great-hearted spirit[300] to go up close, drawing from beside my thigh the sharp sword,[301] and stab him in the chest, where the midriff joins on the liver,[302] feeling for the place with my hand; but the second thought stayed me;[303] for there we too would have perished away in sheer destruction,[304] seeing that our hands could never have pushed from the lofty[305] gate of the cave the ponderous boulder he had propped there.[306] So mourning we waited, just as we were, for the divine Dawn.[307] “But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[308] he lit his fire, and then set about milking his glorious[309] flocks, each of them in order, and put lamb or kid under each one.[310] But after he had briskly done all his chores and finished,[311] again he snatched up two men, and prepared them for dinner,[312] and when he had dined, drove his fat flocks out of the cavern,[313] easily lifting off the great doorstone, but then he put it[314] back again, like a man closing the lid on a quiver.[315] And so the Cyclops, whistling loudly, guided his fat flocks[316] to the hills, leaving me there in the cave mumbling my black thoughts[317] of how I might punish him, how Athene might give me that glory.[318] And as I thought, this was the plan that seemed best to me.[319] The Cyclops had lying there beside the pen a great bludgeon[320] of olive wood, still green. He had cut it so that when it dried out[321] he could carry it about, and we looking at it considered[322] it to be about the size for the mast of a cargo-carrying[323] broad black ship of twenty oars which crosses the open[324] sea; such was the length of it, such the thickness, to judge by[325] looking. I went up and chopped a length of about a fathom,[326] and handed it over to my companions and told them to shave it[327] down, and they made it smooth, while I standing by them sharpened[328] the point, then put it over the blaze of the fire to harden.[329] Then I put it well away and hid it under the ordure[330] which was all over the floor of the cave, much stuff lying[331] about. Next I told the rest of the men to cast lots, to find out[332] which of them must endure with me to take up the great beam[333] and spin it in Cyclops’ eye when sweet sleep had come over him.[334] The ones drew it whom I myself would have wanted chosen,[335] four men, and I myself was the fifth, allotted with them.[336] With the evening he came back again, herding his fleecy[337] flocks, but drove all his fat flocks inside the wide cave[338] at once, and did not leave any outside in the yard with the deep fence,[339] whether he had some idea, or whether a god so urged him.[340] When he had heaved up and set in position the huge door stop,[341] next he sat down and started milking his sheep and his bleating  p 391  [342] goats, each of them in order, and put lamb or kid under each one.[343] But after he had briskly done all his chores and finished,[344] again he snatched up two men and prepared them for dinner.[345] Then at last I, holding in my hands an ivy bowl[346] full of the black wine, stood close up to the Cyclops and spoke out:[347] ‘Here, Cyclops, have a drink of wine, now you have fed on[348] human flesh, and see what kind of drink our ship carried[349] inside her. I brought it for you, and it would have been your libation[350] had you taken pity and sent me home, but I cannot suffer[351] your rages. Cruel, how can any man come and visit[352] you ever again, now you have done what has no sanction?’[353] “So I spoke, and he took it and drank it off, and was terribly[354] pleased with the wine he drank and questioned me again, saying:[355] ‘Give me still more, freely, and tell me your name straightway[356] now, so I can give you a guest present to make you happy.[357] For the grain-giving land of Cyclopes also yields them[358] wine of strength, and it is Zeus’ rain that waters it for them;[359] but this comes from where ambrosia and nectar flow in abundance.’[360] “So he spoke, and I gave him the gleaming wine again. Three times[361] I brought it to him and gave it to him, three times he recklessly[362] drained it, but when the wine had got into the brains of the Cyclops,[363] then I spoke to him, and my words were full of beguilement:[364] ‘Cyclops, you ask me for my famous name. I will tell you[365] then, but you must give me a guest gift as you have promised.[366] Nobody is my name. My father and mother call me[367] Nobody, as do all the others who are my companions.’[368] “So I spoke, and he answered me in pitiless spirit:[369] ‘Then I will eat Nobody after his friends, and the others[370] I will eat first, and that shall be my guest present to you.’[371] “He spoke and slumped away and fell on his back, and lay there[372] with his thick neck crooked over on one side, and sleep who subdues all[373] came on and captured him, and the wine gurgled up from his gullet[374] with gobs of human meat. This was his drunken vomiting.[375] Then I shoved the beam underneath a deep bed of cinders,[376] waiting for it to heat, and I spoke to all my companions[377] in words of courage, so none should be in a panic, and back out;[378] but when the beam of olive, green as it was, was nearly[379] at the point of catching fire and glowed, terribly incandescent,[380] then I brought it close up from the fire and my friends about me[381] stood fast. Some great divinity breathed courage into us.[382] They seized the beam of olive, sharp at the end, and leaned on it[383] into the eye, while I from above leaning my weight on it[384] twirled it, like a man with a brace-and-bit who bores into[385] a ship timber, and his men from underneath, grasping[386] the strap on either side whirl it, and it bites resolutely deeper.[387] So seizing the fire-point-hardened timber we twirled it[388] in his eye, and the blood boiled around the hot point, so that[389] the blast and scorch of the burning ball singed all his eyebrows[390] and eyelids, and the fire made the roots of his eye crackle.[391] As when a man who works as a blacksmith plunges a screaming[392] great ax blade or plane into cold water, treating it[393] for temper, since this is the way steel is made strong, even  p 392  [394] so Cyclops’ eye sizzled about the beam of the olive.[395] He gave a giant horrible cry and the rocks rattled[396] to the sound, and we scuttled away in fear. He pulled the timber[397] out of his eye, and it blubbered with plenty of blood, then[398] when he had frantically taken it in his hands and thrown it[399] away, he cried aloud to the other Cyclopes, who live[400] around him in their own caves along the windy pinnacles.[401] They hearing him came swarming up from their various places,[402] and stood around the cave and asked him what was his trouble:[403] ‘Why, Polyphemos, what do you want with all this outcry[404] through the immortal night and have made us all thus sleepless?[405] Surely no mortal against your will can be driving your sheep off?[406] Surely none can be killing you by force or treachery?’[407] “Then from inside the cave strong Polyphemos answered:[408] ‘Good friends, Nobody is killing me by force or treachery.’[409] “So then the others speaking in winged words gave him an answer:[410] ‘If alone as you are none uses violence on you,[411] why, there is no avoiding the sickness sent by great Zeus;[412] so you had better pray to your father, the lord Poseidon.’[413] “So they spoke as they went away, and the heart within me[414] laughed over how my name and my perfect planning had fooled him.[415] But the Cyclops, groaning aloud and in the pain of his agony,[416] felt with his hands, and took the boulder out of the doorway,[417] and sat down in the entrance himself, spreading his arms wide,[418] to catch anyone who tried to get out with the sheep, hoping[419] that I would be so guileless in my heart as to try this;[420] but I was planning so that things would come out the best way,[421] and trying to find some release from death, for my companions[422] and myself too, combining all my resource and treacheries,[423] as with life at stake, for the great evil was very close to us.[424] And as I thought, this was the plan that seemed best to me.[425] There were some male sheep, rams, well nourished, thick and fleecy,[426] handsome and large, with a dark depth of wool. Silently[427] I caught these and lashed them together with pliant willow[428] withes, where the monstrous Cyclops lawless of mind had used to[429] sleep. I had them in threes, and the one in the middle carried[430] a man, while the other two went on each side, so guarding[431] my friends. Three rams carried each man, but as for myself,[432] there was one ram, far the finest of all the flock. This one[433] I clasped around the back, snuggled under the wool of the belly,[434] and stayed there still, and with a firm twist of the hands and enduring[435] spirit clung fast to the glory of this fleece, unrelenting.[436] So we grieved for the time and waited for the divine Dawn.[437] “But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[438] then the male sheep hastened out of the cave, toward pasture,[439] but the ewes were bleating all through the pens unmilked, their udders[440] ready to burst. Meanwhile their master, suffering and in[441] bitter pain, felt over the backs of all his sheep, standing[442] up as they were, but in his guilelessness did not notice[443] how my men were fastened under the breasts of his fleecy[444] sheep. Last of all the flock the ram went out of the doorway,[445] loaded with his own fleece, and with me, and my close counsels.  p 393  [446] Then, feeling him, powerful Polyphemos spoke a word to him:[447] ‘My dear old ram, why are you thus leaving the cave last of[448] the sheep? Never in the old days were you left behind by[449] the flock, but long-striding, far ahead of the rest would pasture[450] on the tender bloom of the grass, be first at running rivers,[451] and be eager always to lead the way first back to the sheepfold[452] at evening. Now you are last of all. Perhaps you are grieving[453] for your master’s eye which a bad man with his wicked companions[454] put out, after he had made my brain helpless with wine, this[455] Nobody, who I think has not yet got clear of destruction.[456] If only you could think like us and only be given[457] a voice, to tell me where he is skulking away from my anger,[458] then surely he would be smashed against the floor and his brains go[459] spattering all over the cave to make my heart lighter[460] from the burden of all the evils this niddering Nobody gave me.’[461] “So he spoke, and sent the ram along from him, outdoors,[462] and when we had go a little way from the yard and the cavern,[463] first I got myself loose from my ram, then set my companions[464] free, and rapidly then, and with many a backward glance, we[465] drove the long-striding sheep, rich with fat, until we reached[466] our ship, and the sight of us who had escaped death was welcome[467] to our companions, but they began to mourn for the others;[468] only I would not let them cry out, but with my brows nodded[469] to each man, and told them to be quick and to load the fleecy[470] sheep on board our vessel and sail out on the salt water.[471] Quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks,[472] and sitting well in order dashed the oars in the gray sea.[473] But when I was as far from the land as a voice shouting[474] carries, I called out aloud to the Cyclops, taunting him:[475] ‘Cyclops, in the end it was no weak man’s companions[476] you were to eat by violence and force in your hollow[477] cave, and your evil deeds were to catch up with you, and be[478] too strong for you, hard one, who dared to eat your own guests[479] in your own house, so Zeus and the rest of the gods have punished you.’[480] “So I spoke, and still more the heart in him was angered.[481] He broke away the peak of a great mountain and let it[482] fly, and threw it in front of the dark-prowed ship by only[483] a little, it just failed to graze the steering oar’s edge,[484] but the sea washed up in the splash as the stone went under, the tidal[485] wave it made swept as suddenly back from the open[486] sea to the mainland again, and forced us on shore. Then I[487] caught up in my hands the very long pole and pushed her[488] clear again, and urged my companions with words, and nodding[489] with my head, to throw their weight on the oars and bring us[490] out of the threatening evil, and they leaned on and rowed hard.[491] But when we had cut through the sea to twice the previous distance,[492] again I started to call to Cyclops, but my friends about me[493] checked me, first one then another speaking, trying to soothe me:[494] ‘Hard one, why are you trying once more to stir up this savage[495] man, who just now threw his missile in the sea, forcing[496] our ship to the land again, and we thought once more we were finished;[497] and if he had heard a voice or any one of us speaking,  p 394  [498] he would have broken all our heads and our ship’s timbers[499] with a cast of a great jagged stone, so strong is his throwing.’[500] “So they spoke, but could not persuade the great heart in me,[501] but once again in the anger of my heart I cried to him:[502] ‘Cyclops, if any mortal man ever asks you who it was[503] that inflicted upon your eye this shameful blinding,[504] tell him that you were blinded by Odysseus, sacker of cities.[505] Laertes is his father, and he makes his home in Ithaka.’[506] “So I spoke, and he groaned aloud and answered me, saying:[507] ‘Ah now, a prophecy spoken of old is come to completion.[508] There used to be a man here, great and strong, and a prophet,[509] Telemos, Eurymos’ son, who for prophecy was pre-eminent[510] and grew old as a prophet among the Cyclops. This man told me[511] how all this that has happened now must someday be accomplished,[512] and how I must lose the sight of my eye at the hands of Odysseus.[513] But always I was on the lookout for a man handsome[514] and tall, with great endowment of strength on him, to come here;[515] but now the end of it is that a little man, niddering, feeble,[516] has taken away the sight of my eye, first making me helpless[517] with wine. So come here, Odysseus, let me give you a guest gift[518] and urge the glorious Shaker of the Earth to grant you conveyance[519] home. For I am his son, he announces himself as my father.[520] He himself will heal me, if he will, but not any other[521] one of the blessed gods, nor any man who is mortal.’[522] “So he spoke, but I answered him again and said to him:[523] ‘I only wish it were certain I could make you reft of spirit[524] and life, and send you to the house of Hades, as it is certain[525] that not even the Shaker of the Earth will ever heal your eye for you.’[526] “So I spoke, but he then called to the lord Poseidon[527] in prayer, reaching both arms up toward the starry heaven:[528] ‘Hear me, Poseidon who circle the earth, dark-haired. If truly[529] I am your son, and you acknowledge yourself as my father,[530] grant that Odysseus, sacker of cities, son of Laertes,[531] who makes his home in Ithaka, may never reach that home;[532] but if it is decided that he shall see his own people,[533] and come home to his strong-founded house and to his own country,[534] let him come late, in bad case, with the loss of all his companions,[535] in someone else’s ship, and find troubles in his household.’[536] “So he spoke in prayer, and the dark-haired god heard him.[537] Then for the second time lifting a stone far greater[538] he whirled it and threw, leaning into the cast his strength beyond measure,[539] and the stone fell behind the dark-prowed ship by only[540] a little, it just failed to graze the steering oar’s edge,[541] and the sea washed up in the splash as the stone went under; the tidal[542] wave drove us along forward and forced us onto the island.[543] But after we had so made the island, where all the rest of[544] our strong-benched ships were waiting together, and our companions[545] were sitting about them grieving, having waited so long for us,[546] making this point we ran our ship on the sand and beached her,[547] and we ourselves stepped out onto the break of the sea beach,[548] and from the hollow ships bringing out the flocks of the Cyclops[549] we shared them out so none might go cheated of his proper  p 395  [550] portion; but for me alone my strong-greaved companions[551] excepted the ram when the sheep were shared, and I sacrificed him[552] on the sands to Zeus, dark-clouded son of Kronos, lord over[553] all, and burned him the thighs; but he was not moved by my offerings,[554] but still was pondering on a way how all my strong-benched[555] ships should be destroyed and all my eager companions.[556] So for the whole length of the day until the sun’s setting,[557] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine.[558] But when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[559] then we lay down to sleep along the break of the seashore;[560] but when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[561] then I urged on the rest of my companions and told them[562] to go aboard their ships and to cast off the stern cables,[563] and quickly they went aboard the ships and sat to the oarlocks,[564] and sitting well in order dashed their oars in the gray sea.[565] From there we sailed on further along, glad to have escaped death,[566] but grieving still at heart for the loss of our dear companions.book ten[1] “We came next to the Aiolian island, where Aiolos[2] lived, Hippotas’ son, beloved by the immortal[3] gods, on a floating island, the whole enclosed by a rampart[4] of bronze, not to be broken, and the sheer of the cliff runs upward[5] to it; and twelve children were born to him in his palace,[6] six of them daughters, and six sons in the pride of their youth, so[7] he bestowed his daughters on his sons, to be their consorts.[8] And evermore, beside their dear father and gracious mother,[9] these feast, and good things beyond number are set before them;[10] and all their days the house fragrant with food echoes[11] in the courtyard, but their nights they sleep each one by his modest[12] wife, under coverlets, and on bedsteads corded for bedding.[13] We came to the city of these men and their handsome houses,[14] and a whole month he entertained me and asked me everything[15] of Ilion, and the ships of the Argives, and the Achaians’[16] homecoming, and I told him all the tale as it happened.[17] But when I asked him about the way back and requested[18] conveyance, again he did not refuse, but granted me passage.[19] He gave me a bag made of the skin taken off a nine-year[20] ox, stuffed full inside with the courses of all the blowing[21] winds, for the son of Kronos had set him in charge over[22] the winds, to hold them still or start them up at his pleasure.[23] He stowed it away in the hollow ship, tied fast with a silver[24] string, so there should be no wrong breath of wind, not even[25] a little, but set the West Wind free to blow me and carry[26] the ships and the men aboard them on their way; but it was not[27] so to be, for we were ruined by our own folly.[28] “Nevertheless we sailed on, night and day, for nine days,[29] and on the tenth at last appeared the land of our fathers,[30] and we could see people tending fires, we were very close to them.[31] But then the sweet sleep came upon me, for I was worn out  p 396  [32] with always handling the sheet myself, and I would not give it[33] to any other companion, so we could come home quicker[34] to our own country; but my companions talked with each other[35] and said that I was bringing silver and gold home with me,[36] given me by great-hearted Aiolos, son of Hippotas;[37] and thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the man next him:[38] ‘See now, this man is loved by everybody and favored[39] by all, whenever he visits anyone’s land and city,[40] and is bringing home with him handsome treasures taken from the plunder[41] of Troy, while we, who have gone through everything he has[42] on the same venture, come home with our hands empty. Now too[43] Aiolos in favor of friendship has given him all these[44] goods. Let us quickly look inside and see what is in there,[45] and how much silver and gold this bag contains inside it.’[46] “So he spoke, and the evil counsel of my companions[47] prevailed, and they opened the bag and the winds all burst out. Suddenly[48] the storm caught them away and swept them over the water[49] weeping, away from their own country. Then I waking[50] pondered deeply in my own blameless spirit, whether[51] to throw myself over the side and die in the open water,[52] or wait it out in silence and still be one of the living;[53] and I endured it and waited, and hiding my face I lay down[54] in the ship, while all were carried on the evil blast of the stormwind[55] back to the Aiolian island, with my friends grieving.[56] “There again we set foot on the mainland, and fetched water,[57] and my companions soon took their supper there by the fast ships.[58] But after we had tasted of food and drink, then I[59] took along one herald with me, and one companion,[60] and went up to the famous house of Aiolos. There I found him[61] sitting at dinner with his wife and with his own children.[62] We came to the house beside the pillars, and on the doorstone[63] we sat down, and their minds wondered at us and they asked us:[64] ‘What brings you back, Odysseus? What evil spirit has vexed you?[65] We sent you properly on your way, so you could come back[66] to your own country and house and whatever else is dear to you.’[67] “So they spoke, and I though sorry at heart answered:[68] ‘My wretched companions brought me to ruin, helped by the pitiless[69] sleep. Then make it right, dear friends; for you have the power.’[70] “So I spoke to them, plying them with words of endearment,[71] but they were all silent; only the father found words and answered:[72] ‘O least of living creatures, out of this island! Hurry![73] I have no right to see on his way, none to give passage[74] to any man whom the blessed gods hate with such bitterness.[75] Out. This arrival means you are hateful to the immortals.’[76] “So speaking he sent me, groaning heavily, out of his palace,[77] and from there, grieving still at heart, we sailed on further,[78] but the men’s spirit was worn away with the pain of rowing[79] and our own silliness, since homecoming seemed ours no longer.[80] “Nevertheless we sailed on, night and day, for six days,[81] and on the seventh came to the sheer citadel of Lamos,[82] Telepylos of the Laistrygones, where one herdsman, driving[83] his flocks in hails another, who answers as he drives  p 397  [84] his flocks out; and there a man who could do without sleep could earn him[85] double wages, one for herding the cattle, one for the silvery[86] sheep. There the courses of night and day lie close together.[87] There as we entered the glorious harbor, which a sky-towering[88] cliff encloses on either side, with no break anywhere,[89] and two projecting promontories facing each other[90] run out toward the mouth, and there is a narrow entrance,[91] there all the rest of them had their oar-swept ships in the inward[92] part, they were tied up close together inside the hollow[93] harbor, for there was never a swell of surf inside it,[94] neither great nor small, but there was a pale calm on it.[95] I myself, however, kept my black ship on the outside,[96] at the very end, making her fast to the cliff with a cable,[97] and climbed to a rocky point of observation and stood there.[98] From here no trace of cattle nor working of men was visible;[99] all we could see was the smoke going up from the country.[100] So I sent companions ahead telling them to find out[101] what men, eaters of bread, might live here in this country.[102] I chose two men, and sent a third with them, as a herald.[103] They left the ship and walked on a smooth road where the wagons[104] carried the timber down from the high hills to the city,[105] and there in front of the town they met a girl drawing water.[106] This was the powerful daughter of the Laistrygonian[107] Antiphates, who had gone down to the sweet-running wellspring,[108] Artakie, whence they would carry their water back to the city.[109] My men stood by her and talked with her, and asked her who was[110] king of these people and who was lord over them. She readily[111] pointed out to them the high-roofed house of her father.[112] But when they entered the glorious house, they found there a woman[113] as big as a mountain peak, and the sight of her filled them with horror.[114] At once she summoned famous Antiphates, her husband,[115] from their assembly, and he devised dismal death against them.[116] He snatched up one of my companions, and prepared him for dinner,[117] but the other two darted away in flight, and got back to my ship.[118] The king raised the cry through the city. Hearing him the powerful[119] Laistrygones came swarming up from every direction,[120] tens of thousands of them, and not like men, like giants.[121] These, standing along the cliffs, pelted my men with man-sized[122] boulders, and a horrid racket went up by the ships, of men[123] being killed and ships being smashed to pieces. They speared them[124] like fish, and carried them away for their joyless feasting.[125] But while they were destroying them in the deep-water harbor,[126] meanwhile I, drawing from beside my thigh the sharp sword,[127] chopped away the cable that tied the ship with the dark prow,[128] and called out to my companions, and urged them with all speed[129] to throw their weight on the oars and escape the threatening evil,[130] and they made the water fly, fearing destruction. Gladly[131] my ship, and only mine, fled out from the overhanging[132] cliffs to the open water, but the others were all destroyed there.[133] “From there we sailed on further along, glad to have escaped death,[134] but grieving still at heart for the loss of our dear companions.[135] We came to Aiaia, which is an island. There lived Circe  p 398  [136] of the lovely hair, the dread goddess who talks with mortals,[137] who is own sister to the malignant-minded Aietes;[138] for they both are children of Helios, who shines on mortals,[139] and their mother is Perse who in turn is daughter of Ocean.[140] There we brought our ship in to the shore, in silence,[141] at a harbor fit for ships to lie, and some god guided us[142] in. There we disembarked, and for two days and two nights[143] we lay there, for sorrow and weariness eating our hearts out.[144] But when the fair-haired Dawn in her rounds brought on the third day,[145] then at last I took up my spear again, my sharp sword,[146] and went up quickly from beside the ship to find a lookout[147] place, to look for some trace of people, listen for some sound.[148] I climbed to a rocky point of observation and stood there,[149] and got a sight of smoke which came from the halls of Circe[150] going up from wide-wayed earth through undergrowth and forest.[151] Then I pondered deeply in my heart and my spirit,[152] whether, since I had seen the fire and smoke, to investigate;[153] but in the division of my heart this way seemed the best to me,[154] to go back first to the fast ship and the beach of the sea, and give[155] my companions some dinner, then send them forward to investigate.[156] But on my way, as I was close to the oar-swept vessel,[157] some god, because I was all alone, took pity upon me,[158] and sent a great stag with towering antlers right in my very[159] path; he had come from his range in the forest down to the river[160] to drink, for the fierce strength of the sun was upon him. As he[161] stepped out, I hit him in the middle of the back, next to[162] the spine, so that the brazen spearhead smashed its way clean through.[163] He screamed and dropped in the dust and the life spirit fluttered from him.[164] I set my foot on him and drew the bronze spear out of[165] the wound it had made, and rested it on the ground, while I[166] pulled growing twigs and willow withes and, braiding them into[167] a rope, about six feet in length, and looping them over[168] the feet of this great monster on both sides, lashed them together,[169] and with him loaded over my neck went toward the black ship,[170] propping myself on my spear, for there was no way to carry him[171] on the shoulder holding him with one hand, he was such a very[172] big beast. I threw him down by the ship and roused my companions,[173] standing beside each man and speaking to him in kind words:[174] ‘Dear friends, sorry as we are, we shall not yet go down into[175] the house of Hades. Not until our day is appointed.[176] Come then, while there is something to eat and drink by the fast ship,[177] let us think of our food and not be worn out with hunger.’[178] “So I spoke, and they listened at once to me and obeyed me,[179] and unveiling their heads along the beach of the barren water[180] they admired the stag, and truly he was a very big beast.[181] But after they had looked at him and their eyes had enjoyed him,[182] they washed their hands and set to preparing a communal high feast.[183] So for the whole length of the day until the sun’s setting[184] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine.[185] But when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[186] then we lay down to sleep along the break of the seashore;[187] but when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,  p 399  [188] then I held an assembly and spoke forth to all of them:[189] ‘Hear my words, my companions, in spite of your hearts’ sufferings.[190] Dear friends, for we do not know where the darkness is nor the sunrise,[191] nor where the Sun who shines upon people rises, nor where[192] he sets, then let us hasten our minds and think, whether there is[193] any course left open to us. But I think there is none.[194] For I climbed to a rocky place of observation and looked at[195] the island, and the endless sea lies all in a circle[196] around it, but the island itself lies low, and my eyes saw[197] smoke rising in the middle through the undergrowth and the forest.’[198] “So I spoke, and the inward heart in them was broken,[199] as they remembered Antiphates the Laistrygonian[200] and the violence of the great-hearted cannibal Cyclops,[201] and they wept loud and shrill, letting the big tears fall,[202] but there came no advantage to them for all their sorrowing.[203] “I counted off all my strong-greaved companions into two[204] divisions, and appointed a leader for each, I myself[205] taking one, while godlike Eurylochos had the other.[206] Promptly then we shook the lots in brazen helmet,[207] and the lot of great-hearted Eurylochos sprang out. He then[208] went on his way, and with him two-and-twenty companions,[209] weeping, and we whom they left behind were mourning also.[210] In the forest glen they came on the house of Circe. It was[211] in an open place, and put together from stones, well polished,[212] and all about it there were lions, and wolves of the mountains,[213] whom the goddess had given evil drugs and enchanted,[214] and these made no attack on the men, but came up thronging[215] about them, waving their long tails and fawning, in the way[216] that dogs go fawning about their master, when he comes home[217] from dining out, for he always brings back something to please them;[218] so these wolves with great strong claws and lions came fawning[219] on my men, but they were afraid when they saw the terrible big beasts.[220] They stood there in the forecourt of the goddess with the glorious[221] hair, and heard Circe inside singing in a sweet voice[222] as she went up and down a great design on a loom, immortal[223] such as goddesses have, delicate and lovely and glorious[224] their work. Now Polites leader of men, who was[225] the best and dearest to me of my friends, began the discussion:[226] ‘Friends, someone inside going up and down a great piece[227] of weaving is singing sweetly, and the whole place murmurs to the echo[228] of it, whether she is woman or goddess. Come, let us call her.’[229] “So he spoke to them, and the rest gave voice, and called her,[230] and at once she opened the shining doors, and came out, and invited[231] them in, and all in their innocence entered; only[232] Eurylochos waited outside, for he suspected treachery.[233] She brought them inside and seated them on chairs and benches,[234] and mixed them a potion, with barley and cheese and pale honey[235] added to Pramneian wine, but put into the mixture[236] malignant drugs, to make them forgetful of their own country.[237] When she had given them this and they had drunk it down, next thing[238] she struck them with her wand and drove them into her pig pens,[239] and they took on the look of pigs with the heads and voices  p 400  [240] and bristles of pigs, but the minds within them stayed as they had been[241] before. So crying they went in, and before them Circe[242] threw down acorns for them to eat, and ilex and cornel[243] buds, such food as pigs who sleep on the ground always feed on.[244] “Eurylochos came back again to the fast black ship,[245] to tell the story of our companions and of their dismal[246] fate, but he could not get a word out, though he was trying[247] to speak, but his heart was stunned by the great sorrow, and both eyes[248] filled with tears, he could think of nothing but lamentation.[249] But after we had wondered at him and asked him questions,[250] at last he told us about the loss of his other companions:[251] ‘We went, O glorious Odysseus, through the growth as you[252] told us, and found a fine house in the glen. It was[253] in an open place, and put together from stones, well polished.[254] Someone, goddess or woman, was singing inside in a clear voice[255] as she went up and down her loom, and they called her, and spoke to her,[256] and at once she opened the shining doors, and came out and invited[257] them in, and all in their innocence entered, only[258] I waited for them outside, for I suspected treachery.[259] Then the whole lot of them vanished away together, nor did one[260] single one come out, though I sat and watched for a long time.’[261] “So he spoke, and I slung my great bronze sword with the silver[262] nails across my shoulders, and hung my bow on also,[263] and told him to guide me back by the same way he had gone;[264] but he, clasping my knees in both hands, entreated me,[265] and in loud lamentation spoke to me and addressed me:[266] ‘Illustrious, do not take me against my will there. Leave me[267] here, for I know you will never come back yourself, nor bring back[268] any of your companions. Let us rather make haste, and with these[269] who are left, escape, for we still may avoid the day of evil.’[270] “So he spoke, and I answered again in turn and said to him:[271] ‘Eurylochos, you may stay here eating and drinking, even[272] where you are and beside the hollow black ship; only[273] I shall go. For there is strong compulsion upon me.’[274] “So I spoke, and started up from the ship and the seashore.[275] But as I went up through the lonely glens, and was coming[276] near to the great house of Circe, skilled in medicines,[277] there as I came up to the house, Hermes, of the golden[278] staff, met me on my way, in the likeness of a young man[279] with beard new grown, which is the most graceful time of young manhood.[280] He took me by the hand and spoke to me and named me, saying:[281] ‘Where are you going, unhappy man, all alone, through the hilltops,[282] ignorant of the land-lay, and your friends are here in Circe’s[283] place, in the shape of pigs and holed up in the close pig pens.[284] Do you come here meaning to set them free? I do not think[285] you will get back yourself, but must stay here with the others.[286] But see, I will find you a way out of your troubles, and save you.[287] Here, this is a good medicine, take it, and go into Circe’s[288] house; it will give you power against the day of trouble.[289] And I will tell you all the malevolent guiles of Circe.[290] She will make you a potion, and put drugs in the food, but she will not[291] even so be able to enchant you, for this good medicine[292] which I give you now will prevent her. I will tell you the details  p 401  [293] of what to do. As soon as Circe with her long wand strikes you,[294] then drawing from beside your thigh your sharp sword, rush[295] forward against Circe, as if you were raging to kill her,[296] and she will be afraid, and invite you to go to bed with her.[297] Do not then resist and refuse the bed of the goddess,[298] for so she will set free your companions, and care for you also;[299] but bid her swear the great oath of the blessed gods, that she[300] has no other evil hurt that she is devising against you,[301] so she will not make you weak and unmanned, once you are naked.’[302] “So spoke Argeïphontes, and he gave me the medicine,[303] which he picked out of the ground, and he explained the nature[304] of it to me. It was black at the root, but with a milky[305] flower. The gods call it moly. It is hard for mortal[306] men to dig up, but the gods have power to do all things.[307] “Then Hermes went away, passing over the wooded island,[308] toward tall Olympos, and I meanwhile made my way to the house[309] of Circe, but my heart was a storm in me as I went. Now[310] I stood outside at the doors of the goddess with the glorious[311] hair, and standing I shouted aloud; and the goddess heard me,[312] and at once she opened the shining doors and came out and invited[313] me in; and I, deeply troubled in my heart, went in with her.[314] She made me sit down in a chair that was wrought elaborately[315] and splendid with silver nails, and under my feet was a footstool.[316] She made a potion for me to drink and gave it in a golden[317] cup, and with evil thoughts in her heart added the drug to it.[318] Then when she had given it and I drank it off, without being[319] enchanted, she struck me with her wand and spoke and named me:[320] ‘Go to your sty now and lie down with your other friends there.’[321] “So she spoke, but I, drawing from beside my thigh the sharp sword,[322] rushed forward against Circe as if I were raging to kill her,[323] but she screamed aloud and ran under my guard, and clasping both knees[324] in loud lamentation spoke to me and addressed me in winged words:[325] ‘What man are you and whence? Where are your city and parents?[326] The wonder is on me that you drank my drugs and have not been[327] enchanted, for no other man beside could have stood up[328] under my drugs, once he drank and they passed the barrier[329] of his teeth. There is a mind in you no magic will work on.[330] You are then resourceful Odysseus. Argeïphontes[331] of the golden staff was forever telling me you would come[332] to me, on your way back from Troy with your fast black ship.[333] Come then, put away your sword in its sheath, and let us[334] two go up into my bed so that, lying together[335] in the bed of love, we may then have faith and trust in each other.’[336] “So she spoke, and I answered her again and said to her:[337] ‘Circe, how can you ask me to be gentle with you, when it[338] is you who turned my companions into pigs in your palace?[339] And now you have me here myself, you treacherously[340] ask me to go into your chamber, and go to bed with you,[341] so that when I am naked you can make me a weakling, unmanned.[342] I would not be willing to go to bed with you unless[343] you can bring yourself, O goddess, to swear me a great oath[344] that there is no other evil hurt you devise against me.’[345] “So I spoke, and she at once swore me the oath, as I asked her,  p 402  [346] But after she had sworn me the oath, and made an end of it,[347] I mounted the surpassingly beautiful bed of Circe.[348] “Meanwhile, the four maidservants, who wait on Circe[349] in her house, were busy at their work, all through the palace.[350] These are daughters born of the springs and from the coppices[351] and the sacred rivers which flow down to the sea. Of these[352] one laid the coverlets, splendid and stained in purple, over[353] the backs of the chairs, and spread on the seats the cloths to sit on.[354] The second drew up the silver tables and placed them in front of[355] the chairs, and laid out the golden serving baskets upon them.[356] The third mixed wine, kindly sweet and fragrant, in the silver[357] mixing bowl, and set out the golden goblets. The fourth one[358] brought in water, then set about building up an abundant[359] fire, underneath the great caldron, and the water heated.[360] But when the water had come to a boil in the shining bronze, then[361] she sat me down in the bathtub and washed me from the great caldron,[362] mixing hot and cold just as I wanted, and pouring it[363] over shoulders and head, to take the heart-wasting weariness[364] from my limbs. When she had bathed me and anointed me with olive oil,[365] she put a splendid mantle and a tunic upon me,[366] and made me sit down in a chair that was wrought elaborately[367] and splendid with silver nails, and under my feet was a footstool.[368] A maidservant brought water for us and poured it from a splendid[369] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin,[370] for us to wash, and she pulled a polished table before us.[371] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to us,[372] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions,[373] and told us to eat, but nothing pleased my mind, and I sat there[374] thinking of something else, mind full of evil imaginings.[375] “When Circe noticed how I sat there without ever putting[376] my hands out to the food, and with the strong sorrow upon me,[377] she came close, and stood beside me and addressed me in winged words:[378] ‘Why, Odysseus, do you sit so, like a man who has lost his[379] voice, eating your heart out, but touch neither food nor drink. Is it[380] that you suspect me of more treachery? But you have nothing[381] to fear, since I have already sworn my strong oath to you.’[382] “So she spoke, but I answered her again and said to her:[383] ‘Oh, Circe, how could any man right in his mind ever[384] endure to taste of the food and drink that are set before him,[385] until with his eyes he saw his companions set free? So then,[386] if you are sincerely telling me to eat and drink, set them[387] free, so my eyes can again behold my eager companions.’[388] “So I spoke, and Circe walked on out through the palace,[389] holding her wand in her hand, and opened the doors of the pigsty,[390] and drove them out. They looked like nine-year-old porkers. They stood[391] ranged and facing her, and she, making her way through their[392] ranks, anointed each of them with some other medicine,[393] and the bristles, grown upon them by the evil medicine Circe[394] had bestowed upon them before, now fell away from them,[395] and they turned back once more into men, younger than they had been[396] and taller for the eye to behold and handsomer by far.[397] They recognized me, and each of them clung to my hand. The lovely  p 403  [398] longing for lamentation came over us, and the house echoed[399] terribly to the sound, and even the goddess took pity,[400] and she, shining among goddesses, came close and said to me:[401] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[402] go back down now to your fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[403] and first of all, drag your ship up on the land, stowing[404] your possessions and all the ship’s running gear away in the sea caves,[405] and then come back, and bring with you your eager companions.’[406] “So she spoke, and the proud heart in me was persuaded,[407] and I went back down to my fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[408] and there I found beside the fast ship my eager companions[409] pitiful in their lamentation and weeping big tears.[410] And as, in the country, the calves, around the cows returning[411] from pasture back to the dung of the farmyard, well filled with grazing,[412] come gamboling together to meet them, and the pens no longer[413] can hold them in, but lowing incessantly they come running[414] around their mothers, so these men, once their eyes saw me,[415] came streaming around me, in tears, and the spirit in them made them[416] feel as if they were back in their own country, the very[417] city of rugged Ithaka, where they were born and raised up.[418] So they came in tears about me, and cried in winged words:[419] ‘O great Odysseus, we are as happy to see you returning[420] as if we had come back to our own Ithakan country.[421] But come, tell us about the death of our other companions.’[422] “So they spoke, but I answered in soft words and told them:[423] ‘First of all, let us drag our ship up on the land, stowing[424] our possessions and all the ship’s running gear away in the sea caves,[425] and then make haste, all of you, to come along with me,[426] so that you can see your companions, in the sacred dwelling[427] of Circe, eating and drinking, for they have all in abundance.’[428] “So I spoke, and at once they did as I told them. Only[429] Eurylochos was trying to hold back all my other[430] companions, and he spoke to them and addressed them in winged words:[431] ‘Ah, poor wretches. Where are we going? Why do you long for[432] the evils of going down into Circe’s palace, for she will[433] transform the lot of us into pigs or wolves or lions,[434] and so we shall guard her great house for her, under compulsion.[435] So too it happened with the Cyclops, when our companions[436] went into his yard, and the bold Odysseus was of their company;[437] for it was by this man’s recklessness that these too perished.’[438] “So he spoke, and I considered in my mind whether[439] to draw out the long-edged sword from beside my big thigh,[440] and cut off his head and throw it on the ground, even though[441] he was nearly related to me by marriage; but my companions[442] checked me, first one then another speaking, trying to soothe me:[443] ‘Zeus-sprung Odysseus, if you ask us to, we will leave[444] this man here to stay where he is and keep watch over[445] the ship. You show us the way to the sacred dwelling of Circe.’[446] “So they spoke, and started up from the ship and the seashore;[447] nor would Eurylochos be left alone by the hollow[448] ship, but followed along in fear of my fierce reproaches.[449] “Meanwhile, inside the house, Circe with loving care bathed  p 404  [450] the rest of my companions, and anointed them well with olive oil,[451] and put about them mantles of fleece and tunics. We found them[452] all together, feasting well in the halls. When my men[453] looked each other in the face and knew one another,[454] they burst into an outcry of tears, and the whole house echoed,[455] But she, shining among goddesses, came close and said to us:[456] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[457] no longer raise the swell of your lamentation. I too[458] know all the pains you have suffered on the sea where the fish swarm,[459] and all the damage done you on the dry land by hostile[460] men. But come now, eat your food and drink your wine, until[461] you gather back again into your chests that kind of spirit[462] you had in you when first you left the land of your fathers[463] on rugged Ithaka. Now you are all dried out, dispirited[464] from the constant thought of your hard wandering, nor is there any[465] spirit in your festivity, because of so much suffering.’[466] “So she spoke, and the proud heart in us was persuaded.[467] There for all our days until a year was completed[468] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine.[469] But when it was the end of a year, and the months wasted[470] away, and the seasons changed, and the long days were accomplished,[471] them my eager companions called me aside and said to me:[472] ‘What ails you now? It is time to think about our own country,[473] if truly it is ordained that you shall survive and come back[474] to your strong-founded house and to the land of your fathers.’[475] “So they spoke, and the proud heart in me was persuaded.[476] So for the whole length of the day until the sun’s setting[477] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine.[478] But when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[479] they lay down to sleep all about the shadowy chambers,[480] but I, mounting the surpassingly beautiful bed of Circe,[481] clasped her by the knees and entreated her, and the goddess[482] listened to me, and I spoke to her and addressed her in winged words:[483] ‘O Circe, accomplish now the promise you gave, that you[484] would see me on my way home. The spirit within me is urgent[485] now, as also in the rest of my friends, who are wasting[486] my heart away, lamenting around me, when you are elsewhere.’[487] “So I spoke, and she, shining among goddesses, answered:[488] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[489] you shall no longer stay in my house when none of you wish to;[490] but first there is another journey you must accomplish[491] and reach the house of Hades and of revered Persephone,[492] there to consult with the soul of Teiresias the Theban,[493] the blind prophet, whose senses stay unshaken within him,[494] to whom alone Persephone has granted intelligence[495] even after death, but the rest of them are flittering shadows.’[496] “So she spoke, and the inward heart in me was broken,[497] and I sat down on the bed and cried, nor did the heart in me[498] wish to go on living any longer, nor to look on the sunlight.[499] But when I had glutted myself with rolling about and weeping,[500] then at last I spoke aloud and answered the goddess:[501] ‘Circe, who will be our guide on that journey? No one[502] has ever yet in a black ship gone all the way to Hades’.’  p 405  [503] “So I spoke, and she, shining among goddesses, answered:[504] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[505] let no need for a guide on your ship trouble you; only[506] set up your mast pole and spread the white sails upon it,[507] and sit still, and let the blast of the North Wind carry you.[508] But when you have crossed with your ship the stream of the Ocean, you will[509] find there a thickly wooded shore, and the groves of Persephone,[510] and tall black poplars growing, and fruit-perishing willows;[511] then beach your ship on the shore of the deep-eddying Ocean[512] and yourself go forward into the moldering home of Hades.[513] There Pyriphlegethon and Kokytos, which is an off-break[514] from the water of the Styx, flow into Acheron. There is[515] a rock there, and the junction of two thunderous rivers.[516] There, hero, you must go close in and do as I tell you.[517] Dig a pit of about a cubit in each direction,[518] and pour it full of drink offerings for all the dead, first[519] honey mixed with milk, then a second pouring of sweet wine,[520] and the third, water, and over all then sprinkle white barley,[521] and promise many times to the strengthless heads of the perished[522] dead that, returning to Ithaka, you will slaughter a barren[523] cow, your best, in your palace and pile the pyre with treasures,[524] and to Teiresias apart dedicate an all-black[525] ram, the one conspicuous in all your sheepflocks.[526] But when with prayers you have entreated the glorious hordes[527] of the dead, then sacrifice one ram and one black female,[528] turning them toward Erebos, but yourself turn away from them[529] and make for where the river runs, and there the numerous[530] souls of the perished dead will come and gather about you.[531] Then encourage your companions and tell them, taking[532] the sheep that are lying by, slaughtered with the pitiless[533] bronze, to skin these, and burn them, and pray to the divinities,[534] to Hades the powerful, and to revered Persephone,[535] while you yourself, drawing from beside your thigh the sharp sword,[536] crouch there, and do not let the strengthless heads of the perished[537] dead draw nearer to the blood until you have questioned Teiresias.[538] Then, leader of the host, the prophet will soon come to you,[539] and he will tell you the way to go, the stages of your journey,[540] and tell you how to make your way home on the sea where the fish swarm.’[541] “So she spoke, and Dawn of the golden throne came on us,[542] and she put clothing upon me, and outer cloak and a tunic,[543] while she, the nymph, mantled herself in a gleaming white robe[544] fine-woven and delightful, and around her waist she fastened[545] a handsome belt of gold, and on her head was a wimple;[546] while I walked all about the house and roused my companions,[547] standing beside each man and speaking to him in kind words:[548] ‘No longer lie abed and dreaming away in sweet sleep.[549] The queenly Circe has shown me the way. So let us go now.’[550] “So I spoke, and the proud heart in them was persuaded.[551] Yet I did not lead away my companions without some[552] loss. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest man, not terribly[553] powerful in fighting nor sound in his thoughts. This man,[554] apart from the rest of his friends, in search of cool air, had lain[555] down drunkenly to sleep on the roof of Circe’s palace,  p 406  [556] and when his companions stirred to go he, hearing their tumult[557] and noise of talking, started suddenly up, and never thought,[558] when he went down, to go by way of the long ladder,[559] but blundered straight off the edge of the roof, so that his neck bone[560] was broken out of its sockets, and his soul went down to Hades’.[561] “Now as my men were on their way I said a word to them:[562] ‘You think you are on your way back now to your own beloved[563] country, but Circe has indicated another journey[564] for us, to the house of Hades and of revered Persephone[565] there to consult with the soul of Teiresias the Theban.’[566] “So I spoke, and the inward heart in them was broken.[567] They sat down on the ground and lamented and tore their hair out,[568] but there came no advantage to them for all their sorrowing.[569] “When we came down to our fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[570] we sat down, sorrowful, and weeping big tears. Circe[571] meanwhile had gone down herself to the side of the black ship,[572] and tethered aboard it a ram and one black female, easily[573] passing by us unseen. Whose eyes can follow the movement[574] of a god passing from place to place, unless the god wishes?book eleven[1] “Now when we had gone down again to the sea and our vessel,[2] first of all we dragged the ship down into the bright water,[3] and in the black hull set the mast in place, and set sails,[4] and took the sheep and walked them aboard, and ourselves also[5] embarked, but sorrowful, and weeping big tears. Circe[6] of the lovely hair, the dread goddess who talks with mortals,[7] sent us an excellent companion, a following wind, filling[8] the sails, to carry from astern the ship with the dark prow.[9] We ourselves, over all the ship making fast the running gear,[10] sat still, and let the wind and the steersman hold her steady.[11] All day long her sails were filled as she went through the water,[12] and the sun set, and all the journeying-ways were darkened.[13] “She made the limit, which is of the deep-running Ocean.[14] There lie the community and city of Kimmerian people,[15] hidden in fog and cloud, nor does Helios, the radiant[16] sun, ever break through the dark, to illuminate them with his shining,[17] neither when he climbs up into the starry heaven,[18] nor when he wheels to return again from heaven to earth,[19] but always a glum night is spread over wretched mortals.[20] Making this point, we ran the ship ashore, and took out[21] the sheep, and ourselves walked along by the stream of the Ocean[22] until we came to that place of which Circe had spoken.[23] “There Perimedes and Eurylochos held the victims[24] fast, and I, drawing from beside my thigh my sharp sword,[25] dug a pit, of about a cubit in each direction,[26] and poured it full of drink offerings for all the dead, first[27] honey mixed with milk, and the second pouring was sweet wine,[28] and the third, water, and over it all I sprinkled white barley.[29] I promised many times to the strengthless heads of the perished[30] dead that, returning to Ithaka, I would slaughter a barren  p 407  [31] cow, my best, in my palace, and pile the pyre with treasures,[32] and to Teiresias apart would dedicate an all-black[33] ram, the one conspicuous in all our sheep flocks.[34] Now when, with sacrifices and prayers, I had so entreated[35] the hordes of the dead, I took the sheep and cut their throats[36] over the pit, and the dark-clouding blood ran in, and the souls[37] of the perished dead gathered to the place, up out of Erebos,[38] brides, and young unmarried men, and long-suffering elders,[39] virgins, tender and with the sorrows of young hearts upon them,[40] and many fighting men killed in battle, stabbed with brazen[41] spears, still carrying their bloody armor upon them.[42] These came swarming around my pit from every direction[43] with inhuman clamor, and green fear took hold of me.[44] Then I encouraged my companions and told them, taking[45] the sheep that were lying by, slaughtered with the pitiless[46] bronze, to skin these, and burn them, and pray to the divinities,[47] to Hades the powerful, and to revered Persephone,[48] while I myself, drawing from beside my thigh my sharp sword,[49] crouched there, and would not let the strengthless heads of the perished[50] dead draw nearer to the blood, until I had questioned Teiresias.[51] “But first there came the soul of my companion, Elpenor,[52] for he had not yet been buried under earth of the wide ways,[53] since we had left his body behind in Circe’s palace,[54] unburied and unwept, with this other errand before us.[55] I broke into tears at the sight of him, and my heart pitied him,[56] and so I spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[57] ‘Elpenor, how did you come here beneath the fog and the darkness?[58] You have come faster on foot than I could in my black ship.’[59] “So I spoke, and he groaned aloud and spoke and answered:[60] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[61] the evil will of the spirit and the wild wine bewildered me.[62] I lay down on the roof of Circe’s palace, and never thought,[63] when I went down, to go by way of the long ladder,[64] but blundered straight off the edge of the roof, so that my neck bone[65] was broken out of its sockets, and my soul went down to Hades’.[66] But now I pray you, by those you have yet to see, who are not here,[67] by your wife, and by your father, who reared you when you were little,[68] and by Telemachos whom you left alone in your palace;[69] for I know that after you leave this place and the house of Hades[70] you will put back with your well-made ship to the island, Aiaia;[71] there at that time, my lord, I ask that you remember me,[72] and do not go and leave me behind unwept, unburied,[73] when you leave, for fear I might become the gods’ curse upon you;[74] but burn me there with all my armor that belongs to me,[75] and heap up a grave mound beside the beach of the gray sea,[76] for an unhappy man, so that those to come will know of me.[77] Do this for me, and on top of the grave mound plant the oar[78] with which I rowed when I was alive and among my companions.’[79] “So he spoke, and I in turn spoke to him in answer:[80] ‘All this, my unhappy friend, I will do for you as you ask me.’[81] “So we two stayed there exchanging our sad words, I on[82] one side holding my sword over the blood, while opposite[83] me the phantom of my companion talked long with me.  p 408  [84] “Next there came to me the soul of my dead mother,[85] Antikleia, daughter of great-hearted Autolykos,[86] whom I had left alive when I went to sacred Ilion.[87] I broke into tears at the sight of her and my heart pitied her,[88] but even so, for all my thronging sorrow, I would not[89] let her draw near the blood until I had questioned Teiresias.[90] “Now came the soul of Teiresias the Theban, holding[91] a staff of gold, and he knew who I was, and spoke to me:[92] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[93] how is it then, unhappy man, you have left the sunlight[94] and come here, to look on dead men, and this place without pleasure?[95] Now draw back from the pit, and hold your sharp sword away from me,[96] so that I can drink of the blood and speak the truth to you.’[97] “So he spoke, and I, holding away the sword with the silver[98] nails, pushed it back in the sheath, and the flawless prophet,[99] after he had drunk the blood, began speaking to me.[100] ‘Glorious Odysseus, what you are after is sweet homecoming,[101] but the god will make it hard for you. I think you will not[102] escape the Shaker of the Earth, who holds a grudge against you[103] in his heart and because you blinded his dear son, hates you.[104] But even so and still you might come back, after much suffering,[105] if you can contain your own desire, and contain your companions’,[106] at that time when you first put in your well-made vessel[107] at the island Thrinakia, escaping the sea’s blue water,[108] and there discover pasturing the cattle and fat sheep[109] of Helios, who sees all things, and listens to all things.[110] Then, if you keep your mind on homecoming, and leave these unharmed,[111] you might all make your way to Ithaka, after much suffering;[112] but if you do harm them, then I testify to the destruction[113] of your ship and your companions, but if you yourself get clear,[114] you will come home in bad case, with the loss of all your companions,[115] in someone else’s ship, and find troubles in your household,[116] insolent men, who are eating away your livelihood[117] and courting your godlike wife and offering gifts to win her.[118] You may punish the violences of these men, when you come home.[119] But after you have killed these suitors in your own palace,[120] either by treachery, or openly with the sharp bronze,[121] then you must take up your well-shaped oar and go on a journey[122] until you come where there are men living who know nothing[123] of the sea, and who eat food that is not mixed with salt, who never[124] have known ships whose cheeks are painted purple, who never[125] have known well-shaped oars, which act for ships as wings do.[126] And I will tell you a very clear proof, and you cannot miss it.[127] When, as you walk, some other wayfarer happens to meet you,[128] and says you carry a winnow-fan on your bright shoulder,[129] then you must plant your well-shaped oar in the ground, and render[130] ceremonious sacrifice to the lord Poseidon,[131] one ram and one bull, and a mounter of sows, a boar pig,[132] and make your way home again and render holy hecatombs[133] to the immortal gods who hold the wide heaven, all[134] of them in order. Death will come to you from the sea, in[135] some altogether unwarlike way, and it will end you  p 409  [136] in the ebbing time of a sleek old age. Your people[137] about you will be prosperous. All this is true that I tell you.’[138] “So he spoke, but I in turn said to him in answer:[139] ‘All this, Teiresias, surely must be as the gods spun it.[140] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[141] I see before me now the soul of my perished mother,[142] but she sits beside the blood in silence, and has not yet deigned[143] to look directly at her own son and speak a word to me.[144] Tell me, lord, what will make her know me, and know my presence?’[145] “So I spoke, and he at once said to me in answer:[146] ‘Easily I will tell you and put it in your understanding.[147] Any one of the perished dead you allow to come up[148] to the blood will give you a true answer, but if you begrudge this[149] to any one, he will return to the place where he came from.’[150] “So speaking, the soul of the lord Teiresias went back into[151] the house of Hades, once he had uttered his prophecies, while I[152] waited steadily where I was standing, until my mother[153] came and drank the dark-clouding blood, and at once she knew me,[154] and full of lamentation she spoke to me in winged words:[155] ‘My child, how did you come here beneath the fog and the darkness[156] and still alive? All this is hard for the living to look on,[157] for in between lie the great rivers and terrible waters[158] that flow, Ocean first of all, which there is no means of crossing[159] on foot, not unless one has a well-made ship. Are you[160] come now to this place from Troy, with your ship and your companions,[161] after wandering a long time, and have you not yet come[162] to Ithaka, and there seen your wife in your palace?’[163] “So she spoke, and I in turn said to her in answer:[164] ‘Mother, a duty brought me here to the house of Hades.[165] I had to consult the soul of Teiresias the Theban.[166] For I have not yet been near Achaian country, nor ever[167] set foot on our land, but always suffering I have wandered[168] since the time I first went along with great Agamemnon[169] to Ilion, land of good horses, and the battle against the Trojans.[170] But come now, tell me this, and give me an accurate answer.[171] What doom of death that lays men low has been your undoing?[172] Was it a long sickness, or did Artemis of the arrows[173] come upon you with her painless shafts, and destroy you?[174] And tell me of my father and son whom I left behind. Is[175] my inheritance still with them, or does some other[176] man hold them now, and thinks I will come no more? Tell me[177] about the wife I married, what she wants, what she is thinking,[178] and whether she stays fast by my son, and guards everything,[179] or if she has married the best man among the Achaians.’[180] “So I spoke, and my queenly mother answered me quickly:[181] ‘All too much with enduring heart she does wait for you[182] there in your own palace, and always with her the wretched[183] nights and the days also waste her away with weeping.[184] No one yet holds your fine inheritance, but in freedom[185] Telemachos administers your allotted lands, and apportions[186] the equal feasts, work that befits a man with authority[187] to judge, for all call him in. Your father remains, on the estate  p 410  [188] where he is, and does not go to the city. There is no bed there[189] nor is there bed clothing nor blankets nor shining coverlets,[190] but in the winter time he sleeps in the house, where the thralls do,[191] in the dirt next to the fire, and with foul clothing upon him;[192] but when the summer comes and the blossoming time of harvest,[193] everywhere he has places to sleep on the ground, on fallen[194] leaves in piles along the rising ground of his orchard,[195] and there he lies, grieving, and the sorrow grows big within him[196] as he longs for your homecoming, and harsh old age is on him.[197] And so it was with me also and that was the reason I perished,[198] nor in my palace did the lady of arrows, well-aiming,[199] come upon me with her painless shafts, and destroy me,[200] nor was I visited by sickness, which beyond other[201] things takes the life out of the body with hateful weakness,[202] but, shining Odysseus, it was my longing for you, your cleverness[203] and your gentle ways, that took the sweet spirit of life from me.’[204] “So she spoke, but I, pondering it in my heart, yet wished[205] to take the soul of my dead mother in my arms. Three times[206] I started toward her, and my heart was urgent to hold her,[207] and three times she fluttered out of my hands like a shadow[208] or a dream, and the sorrow sharpened at the heart within me,[209] and so I spoke to her and addressed her in winged words, saying:[210] ‘Mother, why will you not wait for me, when I am trying[211] to hold you, so that even in Hades’ with our arms embracing[212] we can both take the satisfaction of dismal mourning?[213] Or are you nothing but an image that proud Persephone[214] sent my way, to make me grieve all the more for sorrow?’[215] “So I spoke, and my queenly mother answered me quickly:[216] ‘Oh my child, ill-fated beyond all other mortals,[217] this is not Persephone, daughter of Zeus, beguiling you,[218] but it is only what happens, when they die, to all mortals.[219] The sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together,[220] and once the spirit has left the white bones, all the rest[221] of the body is made subject to the fire’s strong fury,[222] but the soul flitters out like a dream and flies away. Therefore[223] you must strive back toward the light again with all speed; but remember[224] these things for your wife, so you may tell her hereafter.’[225] “So we two were conversing back and forth, and the women[226] came to me. They were sent my way by proud Persephone.[227] These were all who had been the wives and daughters of princes,[228] and now they gathered in swarms around the dark blood. I then[229] thought about a way to question them, each by herself,[230] and as I thought, this was the plan that seemed best to me;[231] drawing out the long-edged sword from beside my big thigh,[232] I would not let them all drink the dark blood at the same time.[233] So they waited and came to me in order, and each one[234] told me about her origin, and I questioned all of them.[235] “There first I saw Tyro, gloriously descended,[236] and she told me she was the daughter of stately Salmoneus,[237] but said she was the wife of Kretheus, the son of Aiolos,[238] and she was in love with a river, godlike Enipeus, by far[239] the handsomest of all those rivers whose streams cross over  p 411  [240] the earth, and she used to haunt Enipeus’ beautiful waters;[241] taking his likeness, the god who circles the earth and shakes it[242] lay with her where the swirling river finds its outlet,[243] and a sea-blue wave curved into a hill of water reared up[244] about the two, to hide the god and the mortal woman;[245] and he broke her virgin zone and drifted a sleep upon her.[246] But when the god had finished with the act of lovemaking,[247] he took her by the hand and spoke to her and named her, saying:[248] ‘Be happy, lady, in this love, and when the year passes[249] you will bear glorious children, for the couplings of the immortals[250] are not without issue. You must look after them, and raise them.[251] Go home now and hold your peace and tell nobody[252] my name, but I tell it to you; I am the Earthshaker Poseidon.’[253] “So he spoke and dived back into the heaving water[254] of the sea, but she conceived and bore Pelias and Neleus,[255] and both of these grew up to be strong henchmen of mighty[256] Zeus; Pelias lived, rich in sheepflocks, in the wide spaces[257] of Iolkos, while the other was king in sandy Pylos;[258] but this queen among women bore the rest of her children to Kretheus,[259] Aison and Pheres and Amythaon delighting in horses.[260] “After her I saw Antiope, who was the daughter[261] of Asopos, who claimed she had also lain in the embraces[262] of Zeus, and borne two sons to him, Amphion and Zethos.[263] These first established the foundations of seven-gated[264] Thebes, and built the bulwarks, since without bulwarks they could not[265] have lived, for all their strength, in Thebes of the wide spaces.[266] “After her I saw Amphitryon’s wife, Alkmene,[267] who, after lying in love in the embraces of great Zeus,[268] brought forth Herakles, lion-hearted and bold of purpose.[269] And I saw Megara, daughter of high-spirited Kreion,[270] whom Amphitryon’s bold and weariless son had married.[271] “I saw the beautiful Epikaste, Oidipodes’ mother,[272] who in the ignorance of her mind had done a monstrous[273] thing when she married her own son. He killed his father[274] and married her, but the gods soon made it all known to mortals.[275] But he, for all his sorrows, in beloved Thebes continued[276] to be lord over the Kadmeians, all through the bitter designing[277] of the gods; while she went down to Hades of the gates, the strong one,[278] knotting a noose and hanging sheer from the high ceiling,[279] in the constraint of her sorrow, but left to him who survived her[280] all the sorrows that are brought to pass by a mother’s furies.[281] “And I saw Chloris, surpassingly lovely, the one whom Neleus[282] married for her beauty, giving numberless gifts to win her.[283] She was the youngest daughter of Iasos’ son Amphion,[284] who once ruled strongly over Orchomenos of the Minyai.[285] So she was queen of Pylos and she bore him glorious children,[286] Nestor and Chromios and proud Periklymenos. Also[287] she bore that marvel among mortals, majestic Pero,[288] whom all the heroes round about courted, but Neleus would not[289] give her to any, unless he could drive away the broad-faced[290] horn-curved cattle of strong Iphikles out of Phylake.[291] It was hard to do, and only the blameless seer Melampous  p 412  [292] undertook it, but he was bound fast by the hard destiny[293] of the god, and the painful fetters on him, and the loutish oxherds.[294] But when the months and the days had come to an end, and the year[295] had gone full circle and come back with the seasons returning,[296] then strong Iphikles released him, when he had told him[297] all prophecies he knew; and the will of Zeus was accomplished.[298] “And I saw Leda, who had been the wife of Tyndareos,[299] and she had borne to Tyndareos two sons with strong hearts,[300] Kastor, breaker of horses, and the strong boxer, Polydeukes.[301] The life-giving earth holds both of them, yet they are still living,[302] and, even underneath the earth, enjoying the honor[303] of Zeus, they live still every other day; on the next day[304] they are dead, but they are given honor even as gods are.[305] “After her I saw Iphimedeia, wife of Aloeus,[306] but she told me how she had been joined in love with Poseidon[307] and borne two sons to him, but these in the end had not lived[308] long, Otos like a god, and the far-famed Ephialtes;[309] and these were the tallest men the grain-giving earth has brought forth[310] ever, and the handsomest by far, after famous Orion.[311] When they were only nine years old they measured nine cubits[312] across, but in height they grew to nine fathoms, and even made threats[313] against the immortal gods on Olympos, that they would carry[314] the turmoil of battle with all its many sorrows against them,[315] and were minded to pile Ossa on Olympos, and above Ossa[316] Pelion of the trembling leaves, to climb the sky. Surely[317] they would have carried it out if they had come to maturity,[318] but the son of Zeus whom Leto with ordered hair had borne him,[319] Apollo, killed them both, before ever the down gathered[320] below their temples, or on their chins the beards had blossomed.[321] “I saw Phaidra and Prokris and Ariadne, the beautiful[322] daughter of malignant Minos. Theseus at one time[323] was bringing her from Crete to the high ground of sacred Athens,[324] but got no joy of her, since before that Artemis killed her[325] in sea-washed Dia, when Dionysos bore witness against her.[326] “I saw Maira, Klymene, and Eriphyle the hateful,[327] who accepted precious gold for the life of her own dear husband.[328] But I could not tell over the whole number of them nor name all[329] the women I saw who were the wives and daughters of heroes,[330] for before that the divine night would give out. It is time now[331] for my sleep, either joining my companions on board the fast ship,[332] or here; but you, and the gods, will see to my homeward journey.”[333] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence,[334] held in thrall by the story all through the shadowy chambers.[335] Now it was white-armed Arete who began the discourse:[336] “Phaiakians, what do you think now of this man before you[337] for beauty and stature, and for the mind well balanced within him?[338] And again he is my own guest, but each one of you has some part[339] in honoring him. Do not hurry to send him off, nor cut short[340] his gifts, when he is in such need, for you all have many[341] possessions, by the grace of the gods, stored up in your palaces.”[342] Then in turn the aged hero Echeneos spoke forth,[343] who was the most advanced in age of all the Phaiakians:  p 413  [344] “Friends, our circumspect queen is not off the mark in her speaking,[345] nor short of what we expect of her. Do then as she tells us.[346] From now on the word and the act belong to Alkinoös.”[347] Then in turn Alkinoös spoke to him and answered:[348] “Even so this word will be mine to say, as long as[349] I am alive and king over the oar-loving Phaiakians.[350] But let our guest, much though he longs for the homeward journey,[351] still endure to wait till tomorrow, until I have raised all[352] the contribution; but the men shall see to his convoy[353] home, and I most of all; for mine is the power in this district.”[354] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[355] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[356] if you urged me to stay here even for the length of year,[357] and still sped my conveyance home and gave me glorious[358] presents, that would be what I wished, there would be much advantage[359] in coming back with a fuller hand to my own dear country,[360] and I would be more respected so and be more popular[361] with all people who saw me make my return to Ithaka.”[362] Then Alkinoös answered him in turn and said to him:[363] “Odysseus, we as we look upon you do not imagine[364] that you are a deceptive or thievish man, the sort that the black earth[365] breeds in great numbers, people who wander widely, making up[366] lying stories, from which no one could learn anything. You have[367] a grace upon your words, and there is sound sense within them,[368] and expertly, as a singer would do, you have told the story[369] of the dismal sorrows befallen yourself and all of the Argives.[370] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer:[371] Did you see any of your godlike companions, who once with you[372] went to Ilion and there met their destiny? Here is[373] a night that is very long, it is endless. It is not time yet[374] to sleep in the palace. But go on telling your wonderful story,[375] I myself could hold out until the bright dawn, if only[376] you could bear to tell me, here in the palace, of your sufferings.”[377] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[378] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[379] there is a time for many words, and a time for sleeping;[380] but if you insist on hearing me still, I would not begrudge you[381] the tale of these happenings and others yet more pitiful[382] to hear, the sorrows of my companions, who perished later,[383] who escaped onslaught and cry of battle, but perished[384] all for the sake of a vile woman, on the homeward journey.[385] “Now when chaste Persephone had scattered the female[386] souls of the women, driving them off in every direction,[387] there came the soul of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus,[388] grieving, and the souls of the other men, who died with him[389] and met their doom in the house of Aigisthos, were gathered around him.[390] He knew me at once, when he drank the dark blood, and fell to[391] lamentation loud and shrill, and the tears came springing,[392] and threw himself into my arms, meaning so to embrace me,[393] but there was no force there any longer, nor any juice left[394] now in his flexible limbs, as there had been in time past.[395] I broke into tears at the sight of him and my heart pitied him,  p 414  [396] and so I spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[397] ‘Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[398] what doom of death that lays men low has been your undoing?[399] Was it with the ships, and did Poseidon, rousing a stormblast[400] of battering winds that none would wish for, prove your undoing?[401] Or was it on the dry land, did men embattled destroy you[402] as you tried to cut out cattle and fleecy sheep from their holdings,[403] or fighting against them for the sake of their city and women?’[404] “So I spoke, and he in turn said to me in answer:[405] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[406] not in the ships, nor did Poseidon, rousing a stormblast[407] of battering winds that none would wish for, prove my destruction,[408] nor on dry land did enemy men destroy me in battle;[409] Aigisthos, working out my death and destruction, invited[410] me to his house, and feasted me, and killed me there, with the help[411] of my sluttish wife, as one cuts down an ox at his manger.[412] So I died a most pitiful death, and my other companions[413] were killed around me without mercy, like pigs with shining[414] tusks, in the house of a man rich and very powerful,[415] for a wedding, or a festival, or a communal dinner.[416] You have been present in your time at the slaughter of many[417] men, killed singly, or in the strong encounters of battle;[418] but beyond all others you would have been sorry at heart[419] for this scene, how we lay sprawled by the mixing bowl and the loaded[420] tables, all over the palace, and the whole floor was steaming[421] with blood; and most pitiful was the voice I heard of Priam’s[422] daughter Kassandra, killed by treacherous Klytaimestra[423] over me; but I lifted my hands and with them beat on[424] the ground as I died upon the sword, but the sluttish woman[425] turned away from me and was so hard that her hands would not[426] press shut my eyes and mouth though I was going to Hades’.[427] So there is nothing more deadly or more vile than a woman[428] who stores her mind with acts that are of such sort, as this one[429] did when she thought of this act of dishonor, and plotted[430] the murder of her lawful husband. See, I had been thinking[431] that I would be welcome to my children and thralls of my household[432] when I came home, but she with thoughts surpassingly grisly[433] splashed the shame on herself and the rest of her sex, on women[434] still to come, even on the one whose acts are virtuous.’[435] “So he spoke, and I again said to him in answer:[436] ‘Shame it is, how most terribly Zeus of the wide brows[437] from the beginning has been hateful to the seed of Atreus[438] through the schemes of women. Many of us died for the sake of Helen,[439] and when you were far, Klytaimestra plotted treason against you.’[440] “So I spoke, and he in turn said to me in answer:[441] ‘So by this, do not be too easy even with your wife,[442] nor give her an entire account of all you are sure of.[443] Tell her part of it, but let the rest be hidden in silence.[444] And yet you, Odysseus, will never be murdered by your wife.[445] The daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[446] is all too virtuous and her mind is stored with good thoughts.[447] Ah well. She was only a young wife when we left her  p 415  [448] and went off to the fighting, and she had an infant child then[449] at her breast. That child now must sit with the men and be counted.[450] Happy he! For his dear father will come back, and see him,[451] and he will fold his father in his arms, as is right. My wife[452] never even let me feed my eyes with the sight of[453] my own son, but before that I myself was killed by her.[454] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[455] When you bring your ship in to your own dear country, do it[456] secretly, not in the open. There is no trusting in women.[457] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer;[458] tell me if you happened to hear that my son was still living,[459] whether perhaps in Orchomenos, or in sandy Pylos,[460] or perhaps with Menelaos in wide Sparta; for nowhere[461] upon the earth has there been any death of noble Orestes.’[462] “So he spoke, and I again said to him in answer:[463] ‘Son of Atreus, why do you ask me that? I do not know[464] if he is alive or dead. It is bad to babble emptily.’[465] “So we two stood there exchanging our sad words, grieving[466] both together and shedding the big tears. After this,[467] there came to us the soul of Peleus’ son, Achilleus,[468] and the soul of Patroklos and the soul of stately Antilochos,[469] and the soul of Aias, who for beauty and stature was greatest[470] of all the Danaans, next to the stately son of Peleus.[471] The soul of swift-footed Achilleus, scion of Aiakos, knew me,[472] and full of lamentation he spoke to me in winged words:[473] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[474] hard man, what made you think of this bigger endeavor, how could you[475] endure to come down here to Hades’ place, where the senseless[476] dead men dwell, mere imitations of perished mortals?’[477] “So he spoke, and I again said to him in answer:[478] ‘Son of Peleus, far the greatest of the Achaians, Achilleus,[479] I came for the need to consult Teiresias, if he might tell me[480] some plan by which I might come back to rocky Ithaka;[481] for I have not yet been near Achaian country, nor ever[482] set foot on my land, but always I have troubles. Achilleus,[483] no man before has been more blessed than you, nor ever[484] will be. Before, when you were alive, we Argives honored you[485] as we did the gods, and now in this place you have great authority[486] over the dead. Do not grieve, even in death, Achilleus.’[487] “So I spoke, and he in turn said to me in answer:[488] ‘O shining Odysseus, never try to console me for dying.[489] I would rather follow the plow as thrall to another[490] man, one with no land allotted him and not much to live on,[491] than be a king over all the perished dead. But come now,[492] tell me anything you have heard of my proud son, whether[493] or not he went along to war to fight as a champion;[494] and tell me anything you have heard about stately Peleus,[495] whether he still keeps his position among the Myrmidon[496] hordes, or whether in Hellas and Phthia they have diminished[497] his state, because old age constrains his hands and feet, and I[498] am no longer there under the light of the sun to help him,[499] not the man I used to be once, when in the wide Troad  p 416  [500] I killed the best of their people, fighting for the Argives. If only[501] for a little while I could come like that to the house of my father,[502] my force and my invincible hands would terrify such men[503] as use force on him and keep him away from his rightful honors.”[504] “So he spoke, and I again said to him in answer:[505] ‘I have no report to give you of stately Peleus,[506] but as for your beloved son Neoptolemos, I will[507] tell you, since you ask me to do it, all the true story;[508] for I myself, in the hollow hull of a balanced ship, brought him[509] over from Skyros, to join the strong-greaved Achaians. Whenever[510] we, around the city of Troy, talked over our counsels,[511] he would always speak first, and never blunder. In speaking[512] only godlike Nestor and I were better than he was.[513] And when we Achaians fought in the Trojan plain, he never[514] would hang back where there were plenty of other men, nor stay with[515] the masses, but run far out in front, giving way to no man[516] for fury, and many were those he killed in the terrible fighting.[517] I could not tell over the number of all nor name all[518] the people he killed as he fought for the Argives, but what a great man[519] was one, the son of Telephos he slew with the brazen[520] spear, the hero Eurypylos, and many Keteian[521] companions were killed about him, by reason of womanish presents.[522] Next to great Memnon, this was the finest man I ever[523] saw. Again, when we who were best of the Argives entered[524] the horse that Epeios made, and all the command was given[525] to me, to keep close hidden inside, or sally out from it,[526] the other leaders of the Danaans and men of counsel[527] were wiping their tears away and the limbs were shaking under[528] each man of them; but never at any time did I see him[529] losing his handsome color and going pale, or wiping[530] the tears off his face, but rather he implored me to let him[531] sally out of the horse; he kept feeling for his sword hilt[532] and spear weighted with bronze, full of evil thoughts for the Trojans.[533] But after we had sacked the sheer citadel of Priam,[534] with his fair share and a princely prize of his own, he boarded[535] his ship, unscathed; he had not been hit by thrown and piercing[536] bronze, nor stabbed in close-up combat, as often happens[537] in fighting. The War God rages at all, and favors no man.’[538] “So I spoke, and the soul of the swift-footed scion of Aiakos[539] stalked away in long strides across the meadow of asphodel,[540] happy for what I had said of his son, and how he was famous.[541] “Now the rest of the souls of the perished dead stood near me[542] grieving, and each one spoke to me and told of his sorrows.[543] Only the soul of Telamonian Aias stood off[544] at a distance from me, angry still over that decision[545] I won against him, when beside the ships we disputed[546] our cases for the arms of Achilleus. His queenly mother[547] set them as prize, and the sons of the Trojans, with Pallas Athene,[548] judged; and I wish I had never won in a contest like this,[549] so high a head has gone under the ground for the sake of that armor,[550] Aias, who for beauty and for achievement surpassed[551] all the Danaans next to the stately son of Peleus.  p 417  [552] So I spoke to him now in words of conciliation:[553] ‘Aias, son of stately Telamon, could you then never[554] even in death forget your anger against me, because of[555] that cursed armor? The gods made it to pain the Achaians,[556] so great a bulwark were you, who were lost to them. We Achaians[557] grieved for your death as incessantly as for Achilleus[558] the son of Peleus at his death, and there is no other[559] to blame, but Zeus; he, in his terrible hate for the army[560] of Danaan spearmen, visited this destruction upon you.[561] Come nearer, my lord, so you can hear what I say and listen[562] to my story; suppress your anger and lordly spirit.’[563] “So I spoke. He gave no answer, but went off after[564] the other souls of the perished dead men, into the darkness.[565] There, despite his anger, he might have spoken, or I might[566] have spoken to him, but the heart in my inward breast wanted[567] still to see the souls of the other perished dead men.[568] “There I saw Minos, the glorious son of Zeus, seated,[569] holding a golden scepter and issuing judgments among[570] the dead, who all around the great lord argued their cases[571] some sitting and some standing, by the wide-gated house of Hades.[572] “After him I was aware of gigantic Orion[573] in the meadow of asphodel, rounding up and driving together[574] wild animals he himself had killed in the lonely mountains,[575] holding in his hands a brazen club, forever unbroken.[576] “And I saw Tityos, Earth’s glorious son, lying[577] in the plain, and sprawled over nine acres. Two vultures,[578] sitting one on either side, were tearing his liver,[579] plunging inside the caul. With his hands he could not beat them[580] away. He had manhandled Leto, the honored consort[581] of Zeus, as she went through spacious Panopeus, toward Pytho.[582] “And I saw Tantalos also, suffering hard pains, standing[583] in lake water that came up to his chin, and thirsty[584] as he was, he tried to drink, but could capture nothing;[585] for every time the old man, trying to drink, stooped over,[586] the water would drain away and disappear, and the black earth[587] showed at his feet, and the divinity dried it away. Over[588] his head trees with lofty branches had fruit like a shower descending,[589] pear trees and pomegranate trees and apple trees with fruit shining,[590] and figs that were sweet and olives ripened well, but each time[591] the old man would straighten up and reach with his hands for them,[592] the wind would toss them away toward the clouds overhanging.[593] “Also I saw Sisyphos. He was suffering strong pains,[594] and with both arms embracing the monstrous stone, struggling[595] with hands and feet alike, he would try to push the stone upward[596] to the crest of the hill, but when it was on the point of going[597] over the top, the force of gravity turned it backward,[598] and the pitiless stone rolled back down to the level. He then[599] tried once more to push it up, straining hard, and sweat ran[600] all down his body, and over his head a cloud of dust rose.[601] “After him I was aware of powerful Herakles;[602] his image, that is, but he himself among the immortal[603] gods enjoys their festivals, married to sweet-stepping  p 418  [604] Hebe, child of great Zeus and Hera of the golden sandals.[605] All around him was a clamor of the dead as of birds scattering[606] scared in every direction; but he came on, like dark night,[607] holding his bow bare with an arrow laid on the bowstring,[608] and forever looking, as one who shot, with terrible glances.[609] There was a terrible belt crossed over his chest, and a golden[610] baldrick, with marvelous works of art that figured upon it,[611] bears, and lions with glaring eyes, and boars of the forests,[612] the battles and the quarrels, the murders and the manslaughters.[613] May he who artfully designed them, and artfully put them[614] upon that baldrick, never again do any designing.[615] He recognized me at once as soon as his eyes had seen me,[616] and full of lamentation he spoke to me in winged words:[617] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[618] unhappy man, are you too leading some wretched destiny[619] such as I too pursued when I went still in the sunlight?[620] For I was son of Kronian Zeus, but I had an endless[621] spell of misery. I was made bondman to one who was far worse[622] than I, and he loaded my difficult labors on me. One time[623] he sent me here to fetch the dog back, and thought there could be[624] no other labor to be devised more difficult than that[625] one, but I brought the dog up and led him from the realm of Hades,[626] and Hermes saw me on my way, with Pallas Athene.’[627] “So he spoke, and went back into the realm of Hades,[628] but I stayed fast in place where I was, to see if some other[629] one of the generation of heroes who died before me[630] would come; and I might have seen men earlier still, whom I wanted[631] to see, Perithoös and Theseus, gods’ glorious children;[632] but before that the hordes of the dead men gathered about me[633] with inhuman clamor, and green fear took hold of me[634] with the thought that proud Persephone might send up against me[635] some gorgonish head of a terrible monster up out of Hades’.[636] So, going back on board my ship, I told my companions[637] also to go aboard, and to cast off the stern cables;[638] and quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks,[639] and the swell of the current carried her down the Ocean river[640] with rowing at first, but after that on a fair wind following.book twelve[1] “Now when our ship had left the stream of the Ocean river,[2] and come back to the wide crossing of the sea’s waves, and to the island[3] of Aiaia, where lies the house of the early Dawn, her dancing[4] spaces, and where Helios, the sun, makes his uprising,[5] making this point we ran our ship on the sand and beached her,[6] and we ourselves stepped out onto the break of the sea beach,[7] and there we fell asleep and waited for the divine Dawn.[8] “But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[9] then I sent my companions away to the house of Circe[10] to bring back the body of Elpenor, who had died there.[11] Then we cut logs, and where the extreme of the foreland jutted  p 419  [12] out, we buried him, sorrowful, shedding warm tears for him.[13] But when the dead man had burned and the dead man’s armor, piling[14] the grave mound and pulling the gravestone to stand above it,[15] we planted the well-shaped oar in the very top of the grave mound.[16] “So we were busy each with our various work, nor was Circe[17] unaware that we had come back from Hades’. Presently[18] she came, attired, and her attendants following carried[19] bread at her will and many meats and the shining red wine.[20] Bright among goddesses she stood in our midst and addressed us:[21] ‘Unhappy men, who went alive to the house of Hades,[22] so dying twice, when all the rest of mankind die only[23] once, come then eat what is there and drink your wine, staying[24] here all the rest of the day, and then tomorrow, when dawn shows,[25] you shall sail, and I will show you the way and make plain[26] all details, so that neither by land nor on the salt water[27] you may suffer and come to grief by unhappy bad designing.’[28] “So she spoke, and the proud heart in us was persuaded.[29] So for the whole length of the day until sun’s setting,[30] we sat there feasting on unlimited meat and sweet wine.[31] But when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[32] the men lay down to sleep all by the ship’s stern cables,[33] but she, taking me by the hand, made me sit down away from[34] my dear companions, and talked with me, and asked me the details[35] of everything, and I recited all, just as it had happened.[36] Then the queenly Circe spoke in words and addressed me:[37] ‘So all that has been duly done. Listen now, I will tell you[38] all, but the very god himself will make you remember.[39] You will come first of all to the Sirens, who are enchanters[40] of all mankind and whoever comes their way; and that man[41] who unsuspecting approaches them, and listens to the Sirens[42] singing, has no prospect of coming home and delighting[43] his wife and little children as they stand about him in greeting,[44] but the Sirens by the melody of their singing enchant him.[45] They sit in their meadow, but the beach before it is piled with boneheaps[46] of men now rotted away, and the skins shrivel upon them.[47] You must drive straight on past, but melt down sweet wax of honey[48] and with it stop your companions’ ears, so none can listen;[49] the rest, that is, but if you yourself are wanting to hear them,[50] then have them tie you hand and foot on the fast ship, standing[51] upright against the mast with the ropes’ ends lashed around it,[52] so that you can have joy in hearing the song of the Sirens;[53] but if you supplicate your men and implore them to set you[54] free, then they must tie you fast with even more lashings.[55] “ ‘Then, for the time when your companions have driven you past them,[56] for that time I will no longer tell you in detail which way[57] of the two your course must lie, but you yourself must consider[58] this in your own mind. I will tell you the two ways of it.[59] On one side there are overhanging rocks, and against them[60] crashes the heavy swell of dark-eyed Amphitrite.[61] The blessed gods call these rocks the Rovers. By this way[62] not even any flying thing, not even the tremulous[63] doves, which carry ambrosia to Zeus the father, can pass through,  p 420  [64] but every time the sheer rock catches away one even[65] of these; but the Father then adds another to keep the number[66] right. No ship of men that came here ever has fled through,[67] but the waves of the sea and storms of ravening fire carry[68] away together the ship’s timbers and the men’s bodies.[69] That way the only seagoing ship to get through was Argo,[70] who is in all men’s minds, on her way home from Aietes;[71] and even she would have been driven on the great rocks that time,[72] but Hera saw her through, out of her great love for Jason.[73] “ ‘But of the two rocks, one reaches up into the wide heaven[74] with a pointed peak, and a dark cloud stands always around it,[75] and never at any time draws away from it, nor does the sunlight[76] ever hold that peak, either in the early or the late summer,[77] nor could any man who was mortal climb there, or stand mounted[78] on the summit, not if he had twenty hands and twenty[79] feet, for the rock goes sheerly up, as if it were polished.[80] Halfway up the cliff there is a cave, misty-looking[81] and turned toward Erebos and the dark, the very direction[82] from which, O shining Odysseus, you and your men will be steering[83] your hollow ship; and from the hollow ship no vigorous[84] young man with a bow could shoot to the hole in the cliffside.[85] In that cavern Skylla lives, whose howling is terror.[86] Her voice indeed is only as loud as a new-born puppy[87] could make, but she herself is an evil monster. No one,[88] not even a god encountering her, could be glad at that sight.[89] She has twelve feet, and all of them wave in the air. She has six[90] necks upon her, grown to great length, and upon each neck[91] there is a horrible head, with teeth in it, set in three rows[92] close together and stiff, full of black death. Her body[93] from the waist down is holed up inside the hollow cavern,[94] but she holds her heads poked out and away from the terrible hollow,[95] and there she fishes, peering all over the cliffside, looking[96] for dolphins or dogfish to catch or anything bigger,[97] some sea monster, of whom Amphitrite keeps so many;[98] never can sailors boast aloud that their ship has passed her[99] without any loss of men, for with each of her heads she snatches[100] one man away and carries him off from the dark-prowed vessel.[101] “ ‘The other cliff is lower; you will see it, Odysseus,[102] for they lie close together, you could even cast with an arrow[103] across. There is a great fig tree grows there, dense with foliage,[104] and under this shining Charybdis sucks down the black water.[105] For three times a day she flows it up, and three times she sucks it[106] terribly down; may you not be there when she sucks down water,[107] for not even the Earthshaker could rescue you out of that evil.[108] But sailing your ship swiftly drive her past and avoid her,[109] and make for Skylla’s rock instead, since it is far better[110] to mourn six friends lost out of your ship than the whole company.’[111] “So she spoke, but I in turn said to her in answer:[112] ‘Come then, goddess, answer me truthfully this: is there[113] some way for me to escape away from deadly Charybdis,[114] but yet fight the other one off, when she attacks my companions?’[115] “So I spoke, and she, shining among goddesses, answered:  p 421  [116] ‘Hardy man, your mind is full forever of fighting[117] and battle work. Will you not give way even to the immortals?[118] She is no mortal thing but a mischief immortal, dangerous[119] difficult and bloodthirsty, and there is no fighting against her,[120] nor any force of defense. It is best to run away from her.[121] For if you arm for battle beside her rock and waste time[122] there, I fear she will make another outrush and catch you[123] with all her heads, and snatch away once more the same number[124] of men. Drive by as hard as you can, but invoke Krataiïs.[125] She is the mother of Skylla and bore this mischief for mortals,[126] and she will stay her from making another sally against you.[127] “ ‘Then you will reach the island Thrinakia, where are pastured[128] the cattle and the fat sheep of the sun god, Helios,[129] seven herds of oxen, and as many beautiful sheepflocks,[130] and fifty to each herd. There is no giving birth among them,[131] nor do they ever die away, and their shepherdesses[132] are gods, nymphs with sweet hair, Lampetia and Phaethousa,[133] whom shining Neaira bore to Hyperion the sun god.[134] These, when their queenly mother had given them birth and reared them,[135] she settled in the island Thrinakia, far away, to live[136] there and guard their father’s sheep and his horn-curved cattle.[137] Then, if you keep your mind on homecoming and leave these unharmed,[138] you might all make your way to Ithaka, after much suffering;[139] but if you do harm them, then I testify to the destruction[140] of your ship and your companions, but if you yourself get clear,[141] you will come home in bad case with the loss of all your companions.’[142] “So she spoke, and Dawn of the golden throne came on us.[143] She, shining among goddesses, went away, up the island.[144] Then, going back on board my ship, I told my companions[145] also to go aboard, and to cast off the stern cables,[146] and quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks,[147] and sitting well in order dashed the oars in the gray sea;[148] but fair-haired Circe, the dread goddess who talks with mortals,[149] sent us an excellent companion, a following wind, filling[150] the sails, to carry from astern the ship with the dark prow.[151] We ourselves, over all the ship making fast the running gear,[152] sat there, and let the wind and the steersman hold her steady.[153] Then, sorrowful as I was, I spoke and told my companions:[154] ‘Friends, since it is not right for one or two of us only[155] to know the divinations that Circe, bright among goddesses,[156] gave me, so I will tell you, and knowing all we may either[157] die, or turn aside from death and escape destruction.[158] First of all she tells us to keep away from the magical[159] Sirens and their singing and their flowery meadow, but only[160] I, she said, was to listen to them, but you must tie me[161] hard in hurtful bonds, to hold me fast in position[162] upright against the mast, with the ropes’ ends fastened around it;[163] but if I supplicate you and implore you to set me[164] free, then you must tie me fast with even more lashings.’[165] “So as I was telling all the details to my companions,[166] meanwhile the well-made ship was coming rapidly closer[167] to the Sirens’ isle, for the harmless wind was driving her onward;  p 422  [168] but immediately then the breeze dropped, and a windless[169] calm fell there, and some divinity stilled the tossing[170] waters. My companions stood up, and took the sails down,[171] and stowed them away in the hollow hull, and took their places[172] for rowing, and with their planed oarblades whitened the water.[173] Then I, taking a great wheel of wax, with the sharp bronze[174] cut a little piece off, and rubbed it together in my heavy[175] hands, and soon the wax grew softer, under the powerful[176] stress of the sun, and the heat and light of Hyperion’s lordling.[177] One after another, I stopped the ears of all my companions,[178] and they then bound me hand and foot in the fast ship, standing[179] upright against the mast with the ropes’ ends lashed around it,[180] and sitting then to row they dashed their oars in the gray sea.[181] But when we were as far from the land as a voice shouting[182] carries, lightly plying, the swift ship as it drew nearer[183] was seen by the Sirens, and they directed their sweet song toward us:[184] ‘Come this way, honored Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians,[185] and stay your ship, so that you can listen here to our singing;[186] for no one else has ever sailed past this place in his black ship[187] until he has listened to the honey-sweet voice that issues[188] from our lips; then goes on, well pleased, knowing more than ever[189] he did; for we know everything that the Argives and Trojans[190] did and suffered in wide Troy through the gods’ despite.[191] Over all the generous earth we know everything that happens.’[192] “So they sang, in sweet utterance, and the heart within me[193] desired to listen, and I signaled my companions to set me[194] free, nodding with my brows, but they leaned on and rowed hard,[195] and Perimedes and Eurylochos, rising up, straightway[196] fastened me with even more lashings and squeezed me tighter.[197] But when they had rowed on past the Sirens, and we could no longer[198] hear their voices and lost the sound of their singing, presently[199] my eager companions took away from their ears the beeswax[200] with which I had stopped them. Then they set me free from my lashings.[201] “But after we had left the island behind, the next thing[202] we saw was smoke, and a heavy surf, and we heard it thundering.[203] The men were terrified, and they let the oars fall out of[204] their hands, and these banged all about in the wash. The ship stopped[205] still, with the men no longer rowing to keep way on her.[206] Then I going up and down the ship urged on my companions,[207] standing beside each man and speaking to him in kind words:[208] ‘Dear friends, surely we are not unlearned in evils.[209] This is no greater evil now than it was when the Cyclops[210] had us cooped in his hollow cave by force and violence,[211] but even there, by my courage and counsel and my intelligence,[212] we escaped away. I think that all this will be remembered[213] some day too. Then do as I say, let us all be won over.[214] Sit well, all of you, to your oarlocks, and dash your oars deep[215] into the breaking surf of the water, so in that way Zeus[216] might grant that we get clear of this danger and flee away from it.[217] For you, steersman, I have this order; so store it deeply[218] in your mind, as you control the steering oar of this hollow[219] ship; you must keep her clear from where the smoke and the breakers  p 423  [220] are, and make hard for the sea rock lest, without your knowing,[221] she might drift that way, and you bring all of us into disaster.’[222] “So I spoke, and they quickly obeyed my words. I had not[223] spoken yet of Skylla, a plague that could not be dealt with,[224] for fear my companions might be terrified and give over[225] their rowing, and take cover inside the ship. For my part,[226] I let go from my mind the difficult instruction that Circe[227] had given me, for she told me not to be armed for combat;[228] but I put on my glorious armor and, taking up two long[229] spears in my hands, I stood bestriding the vessel’s foredeck[230] at the prow, for I expected Skylla of the rocks to appear first[231] from that direction, she who brought pain to my companions.[232] I could not make her out anywhere, and my eyes grew weary[233] from looking everywhere on the misty face of the sea rock.[234] “So we sailed up the narrow strait lamenting. On one side[235] was Skylla, and on the other side was shining Charybdis,[236] who made her terrrible ebb and flow of the sea’s water.[237] When she vomited it up, like a caldron over a strong fire,[238] the whole sea would boil up in turbulence, and the foam flying[239] spattered the pinnacles of the rocks in either direction;[240] but when in turn again she sucked down the sea’s salt water,[241] the turbulence showed all the inner sea, and the rock around it[242] groaned terribly, and the ground showed at the sea’s bottom,[243] black with sand; and green fear seized upon my companions.[244] We in fear of destruction kept our eyes on Charybdis,[245] but meanwhile Skylla out of the hollow vessel snatched six[246] of my companions, the best of them for strength and hands’ work,[247] and when I turned to look at the ship, with my other companions,[248] I saw their feet and hands from below, already lifted[249] high above me, and they cried out to me and called me[250] by name, the last time they ever did it, in heart’s sorrow.[251] And as a fisherman with a very long rod, on a jutting[252] rock, will cast his treacherous bait for the little fishes,[253] and sinks the horn of a field-ranging ox into the water,[254] then hauls them up and throws them on the dry land, gasping[255] and struggling, so they gasped and struggled as they were hoisted[256] up the cliff. Right in her doorway she ate them up. They were screaming[257] and reaching out their hands to me in this horrid encounter.[258] That was the most pitiful scene that these eyes have looked on[259] in my sufferings as I explored the routes over the water.[260] “Now when we had fled away from the rocks and dreaded Charybdis[261] and Skylla, next we made our way to the excellent island[262] of the god, where ranged the handsome wide-browed oxen, and many[263] fat flocks of sheep, belonging to the Sun God, Hyperion.[264] While I was on the black ship, still out on the open water,[265] I heard the lowing of the cattle as they were driven[266] home, and the bleating of sheep, and my mind was struck by the saying[267] of the blind prophet, Teiresias the Theban, and also[268] Aiaian Circe. Both had told me many times over[269] to avoid the island of Helios who brings joy to mortals.[270] Then sorrowful as I was I spoke and told my companions:[271] ‘Listen to what I say, my companions, though you are suffering  p 424  [272] evils, while I tell you the prophecies of Teiresias[273] and Aiaian Circe. Both have told me many times over[274] to avoid the island of Helios who brings joy to mortals,[275] for there they spoke of the most dreadful disaster that waited[276] for us. So drive the black ship onward, and pass the island.’[277] “So I spoke, and the inward heart in them was broken.[278] At once Eurylochos answered me with a bitter saying:[279] ‘You are a hard man, Odysseus. Your force is greater,[280] your limbs never wear out. You must be made all of iron,[281] when you will not let your companions, worn with hard work and wanting[282] sleep, set foot on this land, where if we did, on the seagirt[283] island we could once more make ready a greedy dinner;[284] but you force us to blunder along just as we are through the running[285] night, driven from the island over the misty face of the water.[286] In the nights the hard stormwinds arise, and they bring damage[287] to ships. How could any of us escape sheer destruction,[288] if suddenly there rises the blast of a storm from the bitter[289] blowing of the South Wind or the West Wind, who beyond others[290] hammer a ship apart, in despite of the gods, our masters?[291] But now let us give way to black night’s persuasion; let us[292] make ready our evening meal, remaining close by our fast ship,[293] and at dawn we will go aboard and put forth onto the wide sea.’[294] “So spoke Eurylochos, and my other companions assented.[295] I saw then what evil the divinity had in mind for us,[296] and so I spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[297] ‘Eurylochos, I am only one man. You force me to it.[298] But come then all of you, swear a strong oath to me, that if[299] we come upon some herd of cattle or on some great flock[300] of sheep, no one of you in evil and reckless action[301] will slaughter any ox or sheep. No, rather than this, eat[302] at your pleasure of the food immortal Circe provided.’[303] “So I spoke, and they all swore me the oath that I asked them.[304] But after they had sworn me the oath and made an end of it,[305] we beached the well-made ship inside of the hollow harbor,[306] close to sweet water, and my companions disembarked also[307] from the ship, and expertly made the evening meal ready.[308] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[309] they remembered and they cried for their beloved companions[310] whom Skylla had caught out of the hollow ship and eaten,[311] and on their crying a quiet sleep descended; but after[312] the third part of the night had come, and the star changes,[313] Zeus the cloud gatherer let loose on us a gale that blustered[314] in a supernatural storm, and huddled under the cloud scuds[315] land alike and the great water. Night sprang from heaven.[316] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[317] we berthed our ship, dragging her into a hollow sea cave[318] where the nymphs had their beautiful dancing places and sessions.[319] Then I held an assembly and spoke my opinion before them:[320] ‘Friends, since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship,[321] let us then keep our hands off the cattle, for fear that something[322] may befall us. These are the cattle and fat sheep of a dreaded[323] god, Helios, who sees all things and listens to all things.’  p 425  [324] “So I spoke, and the proud heart in them was persuaded.[325] But the South Wind blew for a whole month long, nor did any other[326] wind befall after that, but only the South and the East Wind.[327] As long as they still had food to eat and red wine, the men kept[328] their hands off the cattle, striving as they were for sustenance. Then, when[329] all the provisions that had been in the ship had given[330] out, they turned to hunting, forced to it, and went ranging[331] after fish and birds, anything that they could lay hands on,[332] and with curved hooks, for the hunger was exhausting their stomachs.[333] Then I went away along the island in order[334] to pray to the gods, if any of them might show me some course[335] to sail on, but when, crossing the isle, I had left my companions[336] behind, I washed my hands, where there was a place sheltered[337] from the wind, and prayed to all the gods whose hold is Olympos;[338] but what they did was to shed a sweet sleep on my eyelids,[339] and Eurylochos put an evil counsel before his companions:[340] ‘Listen to what I say, my companions, though you are suffering[341] evils. All deaths are detestable for wretched mortals,[342] but hunger is the sorriest way to die and encounter[343] fate. Come then, let us cut out the best of Helios’ cattle,[344] and sacrifice them to the immortals who hold wide heaven,[345] and if we ever come back to Ithaka, land of our fathers,[346] presently we will build a rich temple to the Sun God Helios[347] Hyperion, and store it with dedications, many[348] and good. But if, in anger over his high-horned cattle,[349] he wishes to wreck our ship, and the rest of the gods stand by him,[350] I would far rather gulp the waves and lose my life in them[351] once for all, than be pinched to death on this desolate island.’[352] “So spoke Eurylochos, and the other companions assented.[353] At once, cutting out from near at hand the best of Helios’[354] cattle; for the handsome broad-faced horn-curved oxen[355] were pasturing there, not far from the dark-prowed ship; driving[356] these, they stationed themselves around them, and made their prayers[357] to the gods, pulling tender leaves from a deep-leaved oak tree;[358] for they had no white barley left on the strong-benched vessel.[359] When they had made their prayer and slaughtered the oxen and skinned them,[360] they cut away the meat from the thighs and wrapped them in fat,[361] making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh upon them;[362] and since they had no wine to pour on the burning offerings,[363] they made a libation of water, and roasted all of the entrails;[364] but when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals,[365] they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them.[366] “At that time the quiet sleep was lost from my eyelids,[367] and I went back down to my fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[368] but on my way, as I was close to the oar-swept vessel,[369] the pleasant savor of cooking meat came drifting around me,[370] and I cried out my grief aloud to the gods immortal:[371] ‘Father Zeus, and you other everlasting and blessed[372] gods, with a pitiless sleep you lulled me, to my confusion,[373] and my companions staying here dared a deed that was monstrous.’[374] “Lampetia of the light robes ran swift with the message  p 426  [375] to Hyperion the Sun God, that we had killed his cattle,[376] and angered at the heart he spoke forth among the immortals:[377] ‘Father Zeus, and you other everlasting and blessed[378] gods, punish the companions of Odysseus, son of Laertes;[379] for they outrageously killed my cattle, in whom I always[380] delighted, on my way up into the starry heaven,[381] or when I turned back again from heaven toward earth. Unless[382] these are made to give me just recompense for my cattle,[383] I will go down to Hades’ and give my light to the dead men.’[384] “Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds answered him:[385] ‘Helios, shine on as you do, among the immortals[386] and mortal men, all over the grain-giving earth. For my part[387] I will strike these men’s fast ship midway on the open[388] wine-blue sea with a shining bolt and dash it to pieces.’[389] “All this I heard afterward from fair-haired Kalypso,[390] and she told me she herself had heard it from the guide, Hermes.[391] “But when I came back again to the ship and the seashore,[392] they all stood about and blamed each other, but we were not able[393] to find any remedy, for the oxen were already dead. The next thing[394] was that the gods began to show forth portents before us.[395] The skins crawled, and the meat that was stuck on the spits bellowed,[396] both roast and raw, and the noise was like the lowing of cattle.[397] “Six days thereafter my own eager companions feasted[398] on the cattle of Helios the Sun God, cutting the best ones[399] out; but when Zeus the son of Kronos established the seventh[400] day, then at last the wind ceased from its stormy blowing,[401] and presently we went aboard and put forth on the wide sea,[402] and set the mast upright and hoisted the white sails on it.[403] “But after we had left the island and there was no more[404] land in sight, but only the sky and the sea, then Kronian[405] Zeus drew on a blue-black cloud, and settled it over[406] the hollow ship, and the open sea was darkened beneath it;[407] and she ran on, but not for a very long time, as suddenly[408] a screaming West Wind came upon us, stormily blowing,[409] and the blast of the stormwind snapped both the forestays that were holding[410] the mast, and the mast went over backwards, and all the running gear[411] collapsed in the wash; and at the stern of the ship the mast pole[412] crashed down on the steersman’s head and pounded to pieces[413] all the bones of his head, so that he like a diver[414] dropped from the high deck, and the proud life left his bones there.[415] Zeus with thunder and lightning together crashed on our vessel,[416] and, struck by the thunderbolt of Zeus, she spun in a circle,[417] and all was full of brimstone. My men were thrown in the water,[418] and bobbing like sea crows they were washed away on the running[419] waves all around the black ship, and the god took away their homecoming.[420] “But I went on my way through the vessel, to where the high seas[421] had worked the keel free out of the hull, and the bare keel floated[422] on the swell, which had broken the mast off at the keel; yet[423] still there was a backstay made out of oxhide fastened[424] to it. With this I lashed together both keel and mast, then[425] rode the two of them, while the deadly stormwinds carried me.[426] “After this the West Wind ceased from its stormy blowing,  p 427  [427] and the South Wind came swiftly on, bringing to my spirit[428] grief that I must measure the whole way back to Charybdis.[429] All that night I was carried along, and with the sun rising[430] I came to the sea rock of Skylla, and dreaded Charybdis.[431] At this time Charybdis sucked down the sea’s salt water,[432] but I reached high in the air above me, to where the tall fig tree[433] grew, and caught hold of it and clung like a bat; there was no[434] place where I could firmly brace my feet, or climb up it,[435] for the roots of it were far from me, and the branches hung out[436] far, big and long branches that overshadowed Charybdis.[437] Inexorably I hung on, waiting for her to vomit[438] the keel and mast back up again. I longed for them, and they came[439] late; at the time when a man leaves the law court, for dinner,[440] after judging the many disputes brought him by litigious young men;[441] that was the time it took the timbers to appear from Charybdis.[442] Then I let go my hold with hands and feet, and dropped off,[443] and came crashing down between and missing the two long timbers,[444] but I mounted these, and with both hands I paddled my way out.[445] But the Father of Gods and men did not let Skylla see me[446] again, or I could not have escaped from sheer destruction.[447] “From there I was carried along nine days, and on the tenth night[448] the gods brought me to the island Ogygia, home of Kalypso[449] with the lovely hair, a dreaded goddess who talks with mortals.[450] She befriended me and took care of me. Why tell the rest of[451] this story again, since yesterday in your house I told it[452] to you and your majestic wife? It is hateful to me[453] to tell a story over again, when it has been well told.”book thirteen[1] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence,[2] held in thrall by the story all through the shadowy chambers.[3] Then Alkinoös answered him in turn and said to him:[4] “Odysseus, now that you have come to my house, bronze-founded[5] with the high roof, I think you will not lose your homecoming,[6] nor be driven back from it again, for all your sufferings.[7] Now I lay this charge upon each man of you, such as[8] here in my palace drink the gleaming wine of the princes[9] always at my side, and hear the song of the singer.[10] Clothing for our guest is stored away in the polished[11] chest, and intricately wrought gold, and all those other[12] gifts the Phaiakian men of counsel brought here to give him.[13] Come, let us man by man each one of us give a great tripod[14] and a caldron, and we will make it good to us by a collection[15] among the people. It is hard for a single man to be generous.”[16] So Alkinoös spoke, and his word pleased all the rest of them.[17] They all went home to go to bed, each one to his own house.[18] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[19] they came in haste to the ship, and brought the lavish bronze with them,[20] and Alkinoös, the hallowed prince, himself going on board,[21] stowed it well away under the thwarts, so it would not hamper  p 428  [22] any of the crew as they rowed with their oars and sent the ship speedily[23] on. Then all went to Alkinoös’ house and made the feast ready.[24] Alkinoös, the hallowed prince, sacrificed an ox for them[25] to Zeus, dark-clouded son of Kronos, lord over all men.[26] They burned the thigh pieces and enjoyed feasting on the glorious[27] banquet, and among them Demodokos, the divine singer,[28] sang his songs and was prized by the people. But now Odysseus[29] turned his head again and again to look at the shining[30] sun, to hasten its going down, since he was now eager[31] to go; and as a man makes for his dinner, when all day[32] long his wine-colored oxen have dragged the compact plow for him[33] across the field, and the sun’s setting is welcome for bringing[34] the time to go to his dinner, and as he goes his knees fail him;[35] thus welcome to Odysseus now was the sun going under.[36] Now he spoke aloud to the oar-loving Phaiakians,[37] addressing his words to Alkinoös beyond all others:[38] “O great Alkinoös, pre-eminent among all people,[39] make libation and send me upon my way untroubled;[40] and yourselves fare well, for all my heart desired is now made[41] good, conveyance and loving gifts. May the sky gods make these[42] prosper for me. May I return to my house and find there[43] a blameless wife, and all who are dear to me unharmed. May you[44] in turn, remaining here, bring comfort and cheer to your wedded[45] wives and your children, and may the gods grant success in every[46] endeavor, and no unhappiness be found in your people.”[47] So he spoke, and they all approved his word and encouraged[48] convoy for the guest, for what he said was fair and orderly;[49] then the hallowed prince Alkinoös spoke to his herald:[50] “Pontonoös, now mix a bowl of wine and serve it[51] to all in the palace, so that, with a prayer to our father[52] Zeus, we may send our guest on his way, back to his own country.”[53] So he spoke, and Pontonoös mixed the sweet wine and served it[54] to all, standing beside each person. They poured a libation[55] to all the blessed immortal gods who hold wide heaven[56] from the chairs where they were sitting, but great Odysseus stood up[57] and put the handled goblet into the hand of Arete,[58] and spoke to her aloud and addressed her in winged words, saying:[59] “Farewell to you, O queen, and for all time, until old age[60] comes to you, and death, which befall all human creatures.[61] Now I am on my way; but have joy here in your household,[62] in your children and your people, and in your king, Alkinoös.”[63] So spoke great Odysseus, and strode out over the door sill,[64] and great Alkinoös sent his herald to go along with him[65] and show him the way to the fast ship and the sand of the seashore.[66] Also Arete sent her serving women with him. One[67] carried a mantle, washed and clean, and a tunic. Another[68] one she sent along with him to carry the well-made[69] chest, and a third went along with them bearing food and red wine.[70] But when they had come down to the sea, and where the ship was,[71] the proud escorts promptly took over the gifts, and stowed them[72] away in the hollow hull, and all the food and the drink, then[73] spread out a coverlet for Odysseus, and linen, out on  p 429  [74] the deck, at the stern of the ship’s hull, so that he could sleep there[75] undisturbed, and he himself went aboard and lay down[76] silently. They sat down each in his place at the oarlocks[77] in order, and slipped the cable free from its hole in the stone post.[78] They bent to their rowing, and with their oars tossed up the sea spray,[79] and upon the eyes of Odysseus there fell a sleep, gentle,[80] the sweetest kind of sleep with no awakening, most like[81] death; while the ship, as in a field four stallions drawing[82] a chariot all break together at the stroke of the whiplash,[83] and lifting high their feet lightly beat out their path, so[84] the stern of this ship would lift and the creaming wave behind her[85] boiled amain in the thunderous crash of the sea. She ran on[86] very steady and never wavering; even the falcon,[87] that hawk that flies lightest of winged creatures, could not have paced her,[88] so lightly did she run on her way and cut through the sea’s waves.[89] She carried a man with a mind like the gods for counsel, one whose[90] spirit up to this time had endured much, suffering many[91] pains: the wars of men, hard crossing of the big waters;[92] but now he slept still, oblivious of all he had suffered.[93] At the time when shines that brightest star, which beyond others[94] comes with announcement of the light of the young Dawn goddess,[95] then was the time the sea-faring ship put in to the island.[96] There is a harbor of the Old Man of the Sea, Phorkys,[97] in the countryside of Ithaka. There two precipitous[98] promontories opposed jut out, to close in the harbor[99] and shelter it from the big waves made by the winds blowing[100] so hard on the outside; inside, the well-benched vessels[101] can lie without being tied up, once they have found their anchorage.[102] At the head of the harbor, there is an olive tree with spreading[103] leaves, and nearby is a cave that is shaded, and pleasant,[104] and sacred to the nymphs who are called the Nymphs of the Wellsprings,[105] Naiads. There are mixing bowls and handled jars inside it,[106] all of stone, and there the bees deposit their honey.[107] And therein also are looms that are made of stone, very long, where[108] the nymphs weave their sea-purple webs, a wonder to look on;[109] and there is water forever flowing. It has two entrances,[110] one of them facing the North Wind, where people can enter,[111] but the one toward the South Wind has more divinity. That is[112] the way of the immortals, and no men enter by that way.[113] It was into this bay they rowed their ship. They knew of it beforehand.[114] The ship, hard-driven, ran up onto the beach for as much as[115] half her length, such was the force the hands of the oarsmen[116] gave her. They stepped from the strong-benched ship out onto the dry land,[117] and first they lifted and carried Odysseus out of the hollow[118] hull, along with his bed linen and shining coverlet,[119] and set him down on the sand. He was still bound fast in sleep. Then[120] they lifted and carried out the possessions, those which the haughty[121] Phaiakians, urged by great-hearted Athene, had given him, as he[122] set out for home, and laid them next to the trunk of the olive,[123] all in a pile and away from the road, lest some wayfarer[124] might come before Odysseus awoke, and spoil his possessions.[125] Then they themselves turned back toward home. But the Earthshaker  p 430  [126] had not forgotten those threats he had once uttered at godlike[127] Odysseus in the beginning, and he asked Zeus for counsel:[128] “Father Zeus, no longer among the gods immortal[129] shall I be honored, when there are mortals who do me no honor,[130] the Phaiakians, and yet these are of my own blood. See now,[131] I had said to myself Odysseus would come home only after[132] much suffering. I had not indeed taken his homecoming[133] altogether away, since first you nodded your head and assented[134] to it. But they carried him, asleep in the fast ship, over[135] the sea, and set him down in Ithaka, and gave him numberless[136] gifts, as bronze, and gold abundant, and woven clothing,[137] more than Odysseus could ever have taken from Troy, even[138] if he had come home ungrieved and with his fair share of the plunder.”[139] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:[140] “What a thing to have said, Earthshaker of the wide strength.[141] The gods do not hold you in dishonor. It would be a hard thing[142] if we were to put any slight on the eldest and best among us.[143] But if there is any man who, giving way to the violence[144] and force in him, slights you, it will be yours to punish him.[145] Now and always. Do as you will and as it please you.”[146] Then in turn Poseidon shaker of the earth made answer:[147] “I would act quickly, dark-clouded one, as you advise me,[148] but always I have respect for your anger, and keep out of[149] its way. This time, I wish to stun that beautiful vessel[150] of the Phaiakians out on the misty sea as it comes back[151] from its journey, so that they may stop, and give over conveying[152] people. And I would hide their city under a mountain.”[153] Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:[154] “Good brother, here is the way it seems to my mind best[155] to do. When all the people are watching her from the city[156] as she comes in, then turn her into a rock that looks like[157] a fast ship, close off shore, so that all people may wonder[158] at her. But do not hide their city under a mountain.”[159] When the shaker of the earth Poseidon heard him, he went off[160] striding to Scheria, where the Phaiakians are born and live. There[161] he waited, and the sea-going ship came close in, lightly[162] pursuing her way, and the Earthshaker came close up to her,[163] and turned her into stone and rooted her there to the bottom[164] with a flat stroke of his hand. And then he went away from her.[165] The Phaiakians of the long oars, the sea-famed people,[166] now began talking to each other and spoke in winged words;[167] and thus they would speak, each looking at the man next to him:[168] “Ah me, who was it fastened our swift ship in the water[169] as she came rowing in for home? Just now she could be seen plainly.”[170] Thus one or another spoke but they did not know what had happened.[171] To them now Alkinoös spoke forth and addressed them:[172] “Ah now, the prophecy of old is come to completion,[173] that my father spoke, when he said Poseidon someday would be angry[174] with us, because we are convoy without hurt to all men.[175] He said that one day, as a well-made ship of Phaiakian[176] men came back from a convoy on the misty face of the water,[177] he would stun it, and pile a great mountain over our city, to hide it.  p 431  [178] So the old man spoke. Now all is being accomplished.[179] Come then, let us do as I say, let us all be won over.[180] Stop our conveying of every mortal who makes his arrival[181] here at our city. We must dedicate also to Poseidon[182] twelve bulls, chosen out of the herds. Then he might take pity[183] on us, and not pile up a high mountain over our city.”[184] So he spoke, and they were afraid and made the bulls ready.[185] So these leaders of the Phaiakians and men of counsel[186] among their people made their prayer to the lord Poseidon,[187] standing around the altar. But now great Odysseus wakened[188] from sleep in his own fatherland, and he did not know it,[189] having been long away, for the goddess, Pallas Athene,[190] daughter of Zeus, poured a mist over all, so she could make him[191] unrecognizable and explain all the details to him,[192] to have his wife not recognize him, nor his townspeople[193] and friends, till he punished the suitors for their overbearing oppression.[194] Therefore to the lord Odysseus she made everything look otherwise[195] than it was, the penetrating roads, the harbors where all could[196] anchor, the rocks going straight up, and the trees tall growing.[197] He sprang and stood upright and looked about at his native[198] country, and groaned aloud and struck himself on both thighs[199] with the flats of his hands, and spoke a word of lamentation:[200] “Ah me, what are the people whose land I have come to this time,[201] and are they savage and violent, and without justice,[202] or hospitable to strangers and with minds that are godly?[203] And where shall I take all these many goods? Where shall I[204] myself be driven? I wish I had stayed among the Phaiakians,[205] just where I was, and I would have visited some other powerful[206] king, who then would have been my friend and seen to my journey.[207] Now I do not know where to put all this, and I cannot[208] leave it here, for fear it may become spoil for others.[209] Shame on the leaders of the Phaiakians and their men of counsel,[210] for they were not altogether thoughtful, nor were they righteous,[211] when they took me away here to another land; but they told me[212] they would bring me to sunny Ithaka, and they did not do it.[213] May Zeus of the suppliants punish them, for he oversees other[214] men besides, and punishes anyone who transgresses.[215] But come, let me count my goods and find out whether they might not[216] have gone taking some of it with them in the hollow vessel.”[217] So speaking, he counted up the surpassingly beautiful tripods[218] and caldrons, and the gold and all the fine woven clothing.[219] There was nothing gone from all of this; but he in great sorrow[220] crept over the beach of his own country beside the resounding[221] sea, with much lamentation; but now Athene came near him,[222] likening herself in form to a young man, a herdsman[223] of sheep, a delicate boy, such as the children of kings are,[224] and wearing a well-wrought shawl in a double fold over her shoulders.[225] Under her shining feet she had sandals, and in her hand carried[226] a spear. Odysseus, in joy at the sight, came up to meet her,[227] and spoke aloud to her and addressed her in winged words, saying:[228] “Dear friend, since you are the first I have met with in this country,[229] I give you greeting. Do not cross me with evil purpose,  p 432  [230] but rescue these possessions and me. I make my prayer to you[231] as to a god, and come to your dear knees as a suppliant.[232] And tell me this and tell me truly, so that I may know it.[233] What land is this, what neighborhood is it, what people live here?[234] Is it some one of the sunny islands, or is it some foreland[235] slanted out from the generous mainland into the salt sea?”[236] Then in turn the gray-eyed goddess Athene answered:[237] “You are some innocent, O stranger, or else you have come from[238] far away, if you ask about this land, for it is not[239] so nameless as all that. There are indeed many who know it,[240] whether among those who live toward the east and the sunrise,[241] or those who live up and away toward the mist and darkness. See now,[242] this is a rugged country and not for the driving of horses,[243] but neither is it so unpleasant, though not widely shapen;[244] for there is abundant grain for bread grown here, it produces[245] wine, and there is always rain and the dew to make it[246] fertile; it is good to feed goats and cattle; and timber[247] is there of all sorts, and watering places good through the seasons;[248] so that, stranger, the name of Ithaka has gone even[249] to Troy, though they say that is very far from Achaian country.”[250] So she spoke, and resourceful great Odysseus was happy,[251] rejoicing in the land of his fathers when Pallas Athene[252] daughter of Zeus of the aegis told him the truth of it,[253] and so he answered her again and addressed her in winged words;[254] but he did not tell her the truth, but checked that word from the outset,[255] forever using to every advantage the mind that was in him:[256] “I heard the name of Ithaka when I was in wide Crete,[257] far away, across the sea; now I myself have come here[258] with these goods that you see, but leaving as much again to my children.[259] I have fled, an exile, because I killed the son of Idomeneus,[260] Orsilochos, a man swift of foot, who in wide Crete surpassed[261] all other mortal men for speed of his feet. I killed him[262] because he tried to deprive me of all my share of the plunder[263] from Troy, and for the sake of it my heart suffered many[264] pains: the wars of men; hard crossing of the big waters;[265] for I would not do his father favor, and serve as his henchman[266] in the land of Troy, but I led others, of my own following.[267] I lay in wait for him with a friend by the road, and struck him[268] with the bronze-headed spear as he came back from the fields. There was[269] a very dark night spread over all the sky, nor did anyone[270] see me, nor did anyone know of it when I stripped the life[271] from him. But then, when I had cut him down with the sharp bronze,[272] I went at once to a ship, and supplicated the lordly[273] Phoenician men, and gave them spoil, to stay their eagerness,[274] and asked them to carry me and to set me down in Pylos[275] or shining Elis where the Epeians are lords; but it happened[276] that the force of the wind beat them away from those places, greatly[277] against their will; it was not as if they wished to deceive me.[278] So, driven off those courses, we came in here, by night,[279] and rowed her hastily into the harbor, nor was there any[280] thought in us of the evening meal, much though we wanted it,[281] but all of us came off the ship as we were, and lay down;  p 433  [282] then, weary as I was, the sweetness of sleep came upon me,[283] while they, taking all the possessions out of the hollow hull, set them[284] ashore on the sand, and close to the place where I was lying,[285] and they, embarking, went on their way to strongly settled[286] Sidon; but I, grieving at the heart, was left behind here.”[287] So he spoke. The goddess, gray-eyed Athene, smiled on him,[288] and stroked him with her hand, and took on the shape of a woman[289] both beautiful and tall, and well versed in glorious handiworks,[290] and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words, saying:[291] “It would be a sharp one, and a stealthy one, who would ever get past you[292] in any contriving; even if it were a god against you.[293] You wretch, so devious, never weary of tricks, then you would not[294] even in your own country give over your ways of deceiving[295] and your thievish tales. They are near to you in your very nature.[296] But come, let us talk no more of this, for you and I both know[297] sharp practice, since you are far the best of all mortal[298] men for counsel and stories, and I among all the divinities[299] am famous for wit and sharpness; and yet you never recognized[300] Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, the one who is always[301] standing beside you and guarding you in every endeavor.[302] And it was I who made you loved by all the Phaiakians.[303] And now again I am here, to help you in your devising[304] of schemes, and to hide the possessions which the haughty Phaiakians[305] bestowed—it was by my thought and counsel—on you, as you started[306] for home, and tell you all the troubles you are destined to suffer[307] in your well-wrought house; but you must, of necessity, endure[308] all, and tell no one out of all the men and the women[309] that you have come back from your wanderings, but you must endure[310] much grief in silence, standing and facing men in their violence.”[311] Then in turn resourceful Odysseus spoke to her in answer:[312] “It is hard, O goddess, for even a man of good understanding[313] to recognize you on meeting, for you take every shape upon you.[314] But this I know well: there was a time when you were kind to me[315] in the days when we sons of the Achaians were fighting in Troy land.[316] But after we had sacked the sheer citadel of Priam,[317] and went away in our ships, and the god scattered the Achaians,[318] I never saw you, daughter of Zeus, after that, nor did I[319] know of your visiting my ship, to beat off some trouble[320] from me, but always with my heart torn inside its coverings[321] I wandered, until the gods set me free from unhappiness, until[322] in the rich territory of the Phaiakian men you cheered me[323] with words, then led me, yourself in person, into their city.[324] And now I entreat you in the name of your father; for I do not think[325] I have really come into sunny Ithaka, but have been driven[326] off course to another country, and I think you are teasing me[327] when you tell me I am, and saying it to beguile me; tell me[328] if it is true that I have come back to my own dear country.”[329] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered him:[330] “Always you are the same, and such is the mind within you,[331] and so I cannot abandon you when you are unhappy,[332] because you are fluent, and reason closely, and keep your head always.[333] Anyone else come home from wandering would have run happily  p 434  [334] off to see his children and wife in his halls; but it is not[335] your pleasure to investigate and ask questions, not till[336] you have made trial of your wife; yet she, as always,[337] sits there in your palace, and always with her the wretched[338] nights, and the days also, waste her away with weeping.[339] And I never did have any doubt, but in my heart always[340] knew how you would come home, having lost all of your companions.[341] But, you see, I did not want to fight with my father’s[342] brother, Poseidon, who was holding a grudge against you[343] in his heart, and because you blinded his dear son, hated you.[344] Come, I will show you settled Ithaka, so you will believe me.[345] This is the harbor of the Old Man of the Sea, Phorkys,[346] and here at the head of the harbor is the olive tree with spreading[347] leaves, and nearby is the cave that is shaded, and pleasant,[348] and sacred to the nymphs who are called the Nymphs of the Wellsprings,[349] Naiads. That is the wide over-arching cave, where often[350] you used to accomplish for the nymphs their complete hecatombs;[351] and there is the mountain, Neritos, all covered with forest.”[352] So speaking the goddess scattered the mist, and the land was visible.[353] Long-suffering great Odysseus was gladdened then, rejoicing[354] in the sight of his country, and kissed the grain-giving ground, then[355] raised his hands in the air and spoke to the nymphs, praying:[356] “Naiad nymphs, O daughters of Zeus, I never suspected[357] that I would see you again. Be welcome now to my gentle[358] prayers, but I will also give you gifts, as I used to[359] before, if Athene the Spoiler, Zeus’ daughter, freely grants me[360] to go on living here myself, and sustains my dear son.”[361] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene said to him:[362] “Never fear, let none of these matters trouble your mind. Rather[363] let us hide these possessions without delay, deep in the inward[364] part of the wonderful cave, so they will be kept safe for you.[365] Then we shall make our plans how all may come out best for us.”[366] So the goddess spoke, and went inside the shadowy[367] cave, looking through it for hiding places. Meanwhile, Odysseus[368] brought everything close up, gold, tireless bronze, clothing[369] that had been made with care, given him by the Phaiakians,[370] and stowed it well away inside; and Pallas Athene,[371] daughter of Zeus of the aegis, set a stone against the doorway.[372] The two sat down against the trunk of the hallowed olive,[373] and plotted out the destruction of the overmastering suitors.[374] Their discourse was begun by the goddess gray-eyed Athene:[375] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[376] consider how you can lay your hands on these shameless suitors,[377] who for three years now have been as lords in your palace,[378] and courting your godlike wife, and offering gifts to win her.[379] And she, though her heart forever grieves over your homecoming,[380] holds out some hope for all, and makes promises to each man,[381] sending them messages, but her mind has other intentions.”[382] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[383] “Surely I was on the point of perishing by an evil[384] fate in my palace, like Atreus’ son Agamemnon, unless  p 435  [385] you had told me, goddess, the very truth of all that has happened.[386] Come then, weave the design, the way I shall take my vengeance[387] upon them; stand beside me, inspire me with strength and courage,[388] as when together we brought down Troy’s shining coronal.[389] For if in your fury, O gray-eyed goddess, you stood beside me,[390] I would fight, lady and goddess, with your help against three hundred[391] men if you, freely and in full heart, would help me.”[392] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered:[393] “I will indeed be at your side, you will not be forgotten[394] at the time when we two go to this work, and I will look for endless[395] ground to be spattered by the blood and brains of the suitors,[396] these men who are eating all your substance away. But come now,[397] let me make you so that no mortal can recognize you.[398] For I will wither the handsome flesh that is on your flexible[399] limbs, and ruin the brown hair on your head, and about you[400] put on such a clout of cloth any man will loathe when he sees you[401] wearing it; I will dim those eyes, that have been so handsome,[402] so you will be unprepossessing to all the suitors[403] and your wife and child, those whom you left behind in your palace.[404] First of all, you are to make your way to the swineherd[405] who is in charge of your pigs, but always his thoughts are kindly,[406] and he is a friend to your son and to circumspect Penelope.[407] You will find him posted beside his pigs, and these are herded[408] near the Rock of the Raven and beside the spring Arethousa,[409] to eat the acorns that stay their strength, and drink of the darkling[410] water, for these are nourishing for pigs, and fatten them.[411] There you shall wait, and stay with him, and ask him all questions,[412] while I go over to Sparta, the country of lovely women,[413] and call back Telemachos, your own dear son, Odysseus,[414] who went into spacious Lakedaimon to see Menelaos[415] and ask him for news of you, and whether you were still living.”[416] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[417] “Why then did you not tell him, since in your mind you know all things?[418] Was it so that he too wandering over the barren[419] sea should suffer pains, while others ate up his substance?”[420] Then in turn the goddess gray-eyed Athene answered:[421] “Let him not be too much on your mind. It was I myself[422] who saw him along on that journey, so he would win reputation[423] by going there, and he has no hardship, but now is staying[424] at his ease with the son of Atreus, and all abundance is by him.[425] It is true that the young men with their black ship are lying[426] in wait for him to kill him before he reaches his country;[427] but I think this will not happen, but that sooner the earth will cover[428] some one of those suitors, who now are eating away your substance.”[429] So spoke Athene, and with her wand she tapped Odysseus,[430] and withered the handsome flesh that was upon his flexible[431] limbs, and ruined the brown hair on his head, and about him,[432] to cover all his body, she put the skin of an ancient[433] old man, and then she dimmed those eyes that had been so handsome.[434] Then she put another vile rag on him, and a tunic,[435] tattered, squalid, blackened with the foul smoke, and over it  p 436  [436] gave him the big hide of a fast-running deer, with the hairs rubbed[437] off, to wear, and she gave him a staff, and an ugly wallet[438] that was full of holes, with a twist of rope attached, to dangle it.[439] So they two consulted and went their ways. The goddess[440] went to bright Lakedaimon to fetch the son of Odysseus.book fourteen[1] But Odysseus himself left the harbor and ascended a rugged[2] path, through wooded country along the heights, where Athene[3] had indicated the noble swineherd, who beyond others[4] cared for the house properties acquired by noble Odysseus.[5] He found him sitting in front, on the porch, where the lofty[6] enclosure had been built, in a place with a view on all sides,[7] both large and handsome, cleared all about, and it was the swineherd[8] himself who had built it, to hold the pigs of his absent master,[9] far from his mistress and from aged Laertes. He made it[10] with stones from the field, and topped it off with shrubbery. Outside[11] he had driven posts in a full circle, to close it on all sides,[12] set close together and thick, the dark of the oak, split out[13] from the logs. Inside the enclosure he made twelve pig pens[14] next to each other, for his sows to sleep in, and in each of them[15] fifty pigs who sleep on the ground were confined. These were[16] the breeding females, but the males lay outside, and these were[17] fewer by far, for the godlike suitors kept diminishing[18] their numbers by eating them, since the swineherd kept having[19] to send them in the best of all the well-fattened porkers[20] at any time. Now, they numbered three hundred and sixty,[21] and four dogs, who were like wild beasts, forever were lying[22] by them. These the swineherd, leader of men, had raised up[23] himself. Now he was fitting sandals to his feet, cutting[24] out a well-colored piece of oxhide. Meanwhile, the other[25] swineherds were out with the herded pigs one place or another,[26] three of them, but the fourth he had sent off to the city[27] to take a pig to the insolent suitors, since they so forced him,[28] so they could sacrifice it and glut their appetites on it.[29] Suddenly the wild-baying dogs caught sight of Odysseus.[30] They ran at him with a great outcry, and Odysseus prudently[31] sat down on the ground, and the staff fell out of his hand. But there,[32] beside his own steading, he might have endured a shameful mauling,[33] but the swineherd, quick and light on his feet, came hurrying to him[34] across the porch, and let fall from his hand the shoe he was holding.[35] He shouted at the dogs and scared them in every direction[36] with volleyed showers of stones, and spoke then to his own master:[37] “Old sir, the dogs were suddenly on you and would have savaged you[38] badly; so you would have covered me with shame, but already[39] there are other pains and sorrows the gods have bestowed upon me.[40] For here I sit, mourning and grieving away for a godlike[41] master, and carefully raise his fattened pigs for others[42] to eat, while he, in need of finding some sustenance, wanders[43] some city or countryside of alien-speaking people;  p 437  [44] if he still is alive somewhere and looks on the sunlight.[45] Come, old sir, along to my shelter, so that you also[46] first may be filled to contentment with food and wine, then tell me[47] where you come from, and about the sorrows you have been suffering.”[48] So spoke the noble swineherd and led the way to the shelter,[49] and brought him in, and seated him on brushwood piled up[50] beneath, and spread over this the hide of a hairy wild goat[51] from his own bed. This was great and thick, and Odysseus was happy[52] at how he received him, and spoke a word and named him, saying:[53] “May Zeus, stranger, and the other gods everlasting grant you[54] all you desire the most, for you have received me heartily.”[55] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[56] “Stranger, I have no right to deny the stranger, not even[57] if one came to me who was meaner than you. All vagabonds[58] and strangers are under Zeus, and the gift is a light and a dear one[59] that comes from us, for that is the way of us who are servants[60] and forever filled with fear when they come under power of masters[61] who are new. The gods have stopped the homeward voyage of that one[62] who cared greatly for me, and granted me such possessions[63] as a good-natured lord grants to the thrall of his house; a home[64] of his own, and a plot of land, and a wife much sought after,[65] when the man accomplishes much work and god speeds the labor[66] as he has sped for me this labor to which I am given.[67] So my lord would have done much for me if he had grown old here,[68] but he perished, as I wish Helen’s seed could all have perished,[69] pitched away, for she has unstrung the knees of so many[70] men; for in Agamemnon’s cause my master went also[71] to Ilion, land of good horses, there to fight with the Trojans.”[72] He spoke, and pulled his tunic to with his belt, and went out[73] swiftly to his pig pens where his herds of swine were penned in,[74] and picked out a pair and brought them in and sacrificed them,[75] and singed them, and cut them into little pieces, and spitted them,[76] then roasted all and brought and set it before Odysseus[77] hot on the spits as it was, and sprinkled white barley over it,[78] and mixed the wine, as sweet as honey, in a bowl of ivy,[79] and himself sat down facing him, and urged him on, saying:[80] “Eat now, stranger, what we serving men are permitted[81] to eat: young pigs, but the fattened swine are devoured by the suitors,[82] who have no regard for anyone in their minds, no pity.[83] The blessed gods have no love for a pitiless action,[84] but rather they reward justice and what men do that is lawful;[85–89] and though those are hateful and lawless men who land on an alienshore, and Zeus grants them spoil and plunder, when they have loadedtheir ships with it they set sail away for home, for evenin the minds of these there is stored some fear, which is stronger thanon these there falls strong fear of how they may be regarded.But the suitors, you see, have heard some god-sent rumor, and they know[90] about the dismal death of our man, and they will not decently[91] make their suit, nor go home to their own houses, but at their[92] ease they forcibly eat up his property, and spare nothing.[93] For as many as are the nights and the days from Zeus, on not one[94] of these do they dedicate only a single victim, nor only  p 438  [95] two, and they violently draw the wine and waste it. See now,[96] he had an endlessly abundant livelihood. Not one[97] of the heroes over on the black mainland had so much, no one[98] here on Ithaka, no twenty men together had such[99] quantity of substance as he. I will count it for you.[100] Twelve herds of cattle on the mainland. As many sheepflocks.[101] As many troops of pigs and again as many wide goatflocks,[102] and friends over there, and his own herdsmen, pasture them for him.[103] And here again, at the end of the island, eleven wide flocks[104] of goats in all are pastured, good men have these in their keeping.[105] And day by day each of these people brings in for the suitors[106] a sheep, and each brings in the fatted goat that seems finest,[107] and I myself keep watch on these pigs and guard them, and I too[108] choose with care the best of the pigs, and send it off to them.”[109] He spoke, and the other ate his meat and drank his wine, quietly,[110] greedily and without speaking, and devised evils for the suitors;[111] but when he had dined, and filled his desire with food, the other[112] filled the cup in which he was drinking and handed it to him,[113] all filled with wine, and he received it, and his heart was cheered[114] and he spoke to him then and addressed him in winged words, saying:[115] “Dear friend, who is the man who bought you with his possessions[116] and is so rich and powerful as you tell me? You say[117] he was one who perished in Agamemnon’s cause. Then tell me,[118] and perhaps I might know him if he was such a man, for Zeus knows[119] as do the other immortal gods, if I might have seen him[120] and have some report to give you. I have wandered to many places.”[121] Then the swineherd, leader of men, said to him in answer:[122] “Old sir, there is none who could come here, bringing a report[123] of him, and persuade his wife and his dear son; and yet[124] there are vain and vagabond men in need of sustenance[125] who tell lies, and are unwilling to give a true story;[126] and any vagrant who makes his way to the land of Ithaka[127] goes to my mistress and babbles his lies to her, and she then[128] receives him well and entertains him and asks him everything,[129] and as she mourns him the tears run down from her eyes, since this is[130] the right way for a wife when her husband is far and perished.[131] So you too, old sir, might spin out a well-made story,[132] if someone would give you a cloak or tunic to wear for it. But, for[133] him, the dogs and the flying birds must by now have worried[134] the skin away from his bones, and the soul has left them; or else[135] the fish have eaten him, out in the great sea, and his bones lie[136] now on the mainland shore with the sand piled deeply upon them.[137] So he has perished there, and sorrows are made for his dear ones[138] all hereafter, and me most of all, for never again now[139] will I find again a lord as kind as he, wherever[140] I go; even if I could come back to my father and mother’s[141] house, where first I was born, and they raised me when I was little.[142] But I do not so much mourn for this, much though my longing[143] is to behold them with these eyes and in my own country,[144] but the longing is on me for Odysseus, and he is gone from me;[145] and even when he is not here, my friend, I feel some modesty[146] about naming him, for in his heart he cared for me greatly[147] and loved me. So I call him my master, though he is absent.”  p 439  [148] Then long-suffering great Odysseus spoke to him in answer:[149] “Dear friend, since you are altogether full of denial,[150] you do not think he will come, and your heart is ever untrusting;[151] but I will not speak in the same manner, but on my oath tell you[152] Odysseus is on his way home. Let me have my reward for good news[153] then, as soon as he is come back and enters his own house.[154] Give me fine clothing, a cloak and tunic to wear. Before that,[155] much as I stand in need of these, I will not accept them.[156] For as I detest the doorways of Death I detest that man who[157] under constraint of poverty babbles beguiling falsehoods.[158] Zeus be my witness, first of the gods, and the table of friendship,[159] and the hearth of blameless Odysseus, to which I come as a suppliant,[160] all these things are being accomplished in the way I tell them.[161] Sometime within this very year Odysseus will be here.[162] Either at the waning of the moon, or at its onset,[163] he will come home and take his vengeance here upon any[164] who deprives his wife and his glorious son of their due honor.”[165] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[166] “Old sir, I will never pay you that gift for good news,[167] nor will Odysseus come to this house again. Be easy[168] and drink your wine. We will think of other matters. Do not then[169] keep on reminding me of this, for the heart within me[170] grieves whenever anyone speaks of my gracious master.[171] So we will let your oath alone, but I hope that Odysseus[172] will come back, as I wish, and as Penelope wishes,[173] and Laertes the old man too, and godlike Telemachos.[174] But now I grieve unforgettingly for Telemachos, the son[175] born to Odysseus. The gods made him grow like a young tree,[176] and I thought he would be among the men one not inferior[177] to his dear father, admirable for build and beauty;[178] but some immortal upset the balanced mind within him,[179] or else it was some man. He went after news of his father[180] to Pylos the sacrosanct, and the haughty suitors are lying[181] in wait for him as he comes home, to make Arkeisios’[182] stock and seed perish all away and be nameless in Ithaka.[183] Now we will let him be, however, whether they catch him[184] or whether he escapes and the son of Kronos protects him.[185] But come now, aged sir, recite me the tale of your sorrows,[186] and tell me this too, tell me truly, so that I may know it:[187] What man are you and whence? Where is your city? Your parents?[188] What kind of ship did you come here on? And how did the sailors[189] bring you to Ithaka? What men do they claim that they are?[190] For I do not think you could have traveled on foot to this country.”[191] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[192] “See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[193] I only wish there were food enough for the time, for us two,[194] and sweet wine for us here inside of the shelter, so that[195] we could feast quietly while others tended the work; then[196] easily I could go on for the whole of a year, and still not[197] finish the story of my heart’s tribulations, all that[198] hard work I have done in my time, because the gods willed it.[199] I announce that my origin is from Crete, a spacious[200] land; I am son of a rich man, and there were many other  p 440  [201] sons who were born to him and reared in his palace. These were[202] lawful sons by his wife, but a bought woman, a concubine,[203] was my mother, yet I was favored with the legitimate[204] sons by Kastor, Hylakos’ son, whom I claim as father,[205] honored among the Cretans in the countryside as a god is,[206] in those days, for wealth and power and glorious children.[207] But then, you see, the death spirits caught and carried him from us[208] to the house of Hades, and his overbearing sons divided[209] the livelihood among them and cast lots for it. Little[210] enough, however, was what they gave me in goods and houses.[211] But I took for myself a wife from people with many possessions,[212] because of my courage, for I was no contemptible man, not[213] one who fled from the fighting; but now all that has gone from me,[214] but still, I think, if you look at the stubble you see what the corn was[215] like when it grew, but since then hardship enough has had me.[216] Ares and Athene endowed me with courage, that power[217] that breaks men in battle. Whenever I detailed the best fighters[218] to go into ambush, planning evil things for the enemy,[219] the proud heart in me had no image of death before it,[220] but far the first I would leap out and with my spear bring down[221] that enemy man whose speed of foot failed him against me.[222] Such was I in the fighting; but labor was never dear to me,[223] nor care for my house, though that is what raises glorious children;[224] but ships that are driven on by oars were dear to me always,[225] and the wars, and throwing spears with polished hafts, and the arrows,[226] gloomy things, which to other men are terrible and yet[227] those things were dear to me which surely some god had put there[228] in my heart, for different men take joy in different actions.[229] Before the sons of the Achaians embarked for Troy, I was[230] nine times a leader of men and went in fast-faring vessels[231] against outland men, and much substance came my way, and from this[232] I took out an abundance of things, but much I allotted[233] again, and soon my house grew greater, and from that time on[234] I went among the Cretans as one feared and respected.[235] But when Zeus of the wide brows devised for us that hateful[236] expedition, which unstrung the knees of so many[237] men, they were urgent upon me and renowned Idomeneus[238] to lead with the ships to Ilion, and there was no remedy,[239] nor any refusing, for the hard speech of the people constrained us.[240] Then for nine years we sons of the Achaians fought there,[241] and in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam, and went back[242] homeward with our ships, and the god scattered the Achaians.[243] But for wretched me Zeus of the counsels devised more hardships;[244] one month only I stayed, taking pleasure in my children[245] and my wedded wife and my possessions, but then the spirit[246] within me urged me to make an expedition to Egypt[247] with ships well appointed and with my godlike companions.[248] I appointed nine ships, and rapidly the people were gathered,[249] and for six days then my eager companions continued[250] feasting, but I provided them with abundant victims[251] for sacrifice to the gods, and for themselves to make ready[252] their feast. On the seventh day we went aboard and from wide Crete  p 441  [253] sailed on a North Wind that was favorable and fair. It was[254] easy, like sailing downstream, so that never a single[255] one of my ships was hurt, and we, unharmed, without sickness,[256] sat still, and let the wind and the steersmen hold them steady.[257] On the fifth day we reached the abundant stream Aigyptos,[258] and I stayed my oarswept ships inside the Aigyptos River.[259] Then I urged my eager companions to stay where they were, there[260] close to the fleet, and to guard the ships, and was urgent with them[261] to send look-outs to the watching places; but they, following[262] their own impulse and giving way to marauding violence,[263] suddenly began plundering the Egyptians’ beautiful[264] fields, and carried off the women and innocent children,[265] and killed the men, and soon the outcry came to the city.[266] They heard the shouting, and at the time when dawn shows, they came[267] on us, and all the plain was filled with horses and infantry[268] and the glare of bronze, and Zeus who delights in thunder flung down[269] a foul panic among my companions, and none was so hardy[270] as to stand and fight, for the evils stood in a circle around them.[271] There they killed many of us with the sharp bronze, and others[272] they led away alive, to work for them in forced labor;[273] but Zeus himself put this thought into my mind, as I will[274] tell you, but how I wish I had died and met my destiny[275] there in Egypt, for there was still more sorrow awaiting me.[276] At once I put the well-wrought helm from my head, the great shield[277] off my shoulders, and from my hand I let the spear drop,[278] and went out into the way of the king and up to his chariot,[279] and kissed his knees and clasped them; he rescued me and took pity[280] and seated me in his chariot and took me, weeping, homeward[281] with him; and indeed many swept in on me with ash spears[282] straining to kill me, for they were all too angered, but the king[283] held them off from me, and honored the anger of Zeus Protector[284] of Strangers, who beyond others is outraged at evil dealings.[285] There for seven years I stayed and gathered together[286] much substance from the men of Egypt, for all gave to me;[287] but when in the turning of time the eighth year had befallen me,[288] then there came a Phoenician man, well skilled in beguilements,[289] a gnawer at others’ goods, and many were the hurts he inflicted[290] on men, and by his wits talked me over, so I went with him[291] to Phoenicia, where lay this man’s house and possessions.[292] There for the fulfillment of a year I stayed with him,[293] but when the months and when the days had come to completion,[294] with the circling back of the year again, and the seasons came on,[295] then he took me on his seafaring ship to Libya,[296] with lying advices, that with him we could win a cargo, but in fact[297] so he could sell me there and take the immense price for me.[298] I went with him on his ship, forced to, although I suspected[299] all, on a North Wind that was favorable and fair, above[300] the middle of Crete, but Zeus was plotting these men’s destruction.[301] But after we had left Crete behind us, and there was no more[302] land in sight, but only the sky and the sea, then Kronian[303] Zeus drew on a blue-black cloud, and settled it over[304] the hollow ship, and the open sea was darkened beneath it.  p 442  [305] Zeus with thunder and lightning together crashed on our vessel,[306] and, struck by the thunderbolt of Zeus, she spun in a circle,[307] and all was full of brimstone. The men were thrown in the water,[308] and bobbing like sea crows they were washed away on the running[309] waves all around the black ship, and the god took away their homecoming.[310] But Zeus himself, though I had pain in my heart, then put[311] into my hands the giant mast of the ship with dark prows,[312] so that I still could escape the evil, and I embracing[313] this was swept along before the destructive stormwinds.[314] Nine days I was swept along, and on the tenth, in black night,[315] the great wave rolling washed me up on the shore of Thesprotia.[316] There the king of the Thesprotians, the hero Pheidon,[317] looked after me without price, for his own dear son had come on me[318] when I was beaten by weariness and cold air, and lifted me[319] up by the hands, and led me home to the house of his father,[320] and put a mantle and tunic about me to wear as clothing.[321] It was there I had word of Odysseus, for this king told me[322] he had feasted and friended him on his way back to his own country;[323] and he showed me all the possessions gathered in by Odysseus,[324] bronze and gold and difficultly wrought iron. Truly,[325] that would feed a succession of heirs to the tenth generation,[326] such are the treasures stored for him in the house of the great king.[327] But he said Odysseus had gone to Dodona, to listen[328] to the will of Zeus, out of the holy deep-leaved oak tree,[329] for how he could come back to the rich countryside of Ithaka,[330] in secret or openly, having been by now long absent.[331] And he swore to me in my presence, as he poured out a libation[332] in his house, that the ship was drawn down to the sea and the crew were ready[333] to carry Odysseus back again to his own dear country;[334] but before that he sent me off, for a ship of Thesprotian[335] men happened then to be sailing for Doulichion, rich in wheatfields;[336] so he urged them to convey me there to the king Akastos,[337] in a proper way, but their hearts were taken with a bad counsel[338] concerning me, so I still should have the pain of affliction.[339] So when the seafaring ship had gone far out from the mainland,[340] they presently devised the day of slavery for me.[341] They took off me the mantle and tunic I wore as clothing,[342] and then they put another vile rag on me, and a tunic,[343] tattered, the one you yourself see with your eyes. At evening[344] time they made their way off the fields of sunny Ithaka,[345] and there they tied me fast in the strong-benched ship, with a rope’s end[346] twisted and tightly about me, and themselves disembarking[347] speedily took their evening meal on the sand of the seashore.[348] But the very gods themselves untied the knots that were on me[349] easily, and I, wrapping my head in a rag, climbed down[350] the polished plank that was there for loading, and let my chest into[351] the sea, then struck out with both my arms, and thus swimming[352] I very soon was out of the water and close to where they were.[353] Then I went up, where there was a growth of flowering thicket,[354] and lay there, cowering; they with outcry great and sorrowful  p 443  [355] came back to search, but then it seemed there was no more profit[356] in looking for me any longer, and so they went back, boarding[357] their hollow ship again: but it was the gods who concealed me[358] easily, and it was they who brought me here to the steading[359] of an understanding man. So now, life is still my portion.”[360] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[361] “O sorrowful stranger, truly you troubled the spirit in me,[362] by telling me all these details, how you suffered and wandered;[363] yet I think some part is in no true order, and you will not persuade me[364] in your talk about Odysseus. Why should such a man as you are[365] lie recklessly to me? But I myself know the whole truth[366] of what my lord’s homecoming is, how all the gods hated him[367] so much that they did not make him go down in the land of the Trojans,[368] nor in the arms of his friends, after he had wound up the fighting.[369] So all the Achaians would have heaped a grave mound over him,[370] and he would have won great fame for himself and his son hereafter.[371] But now ingloriously the stormwinds have caught and carried him.[372] But I keep away and with my pigs, and I do not go now[373] to the city, unless circumspect Penelope for some reason[374] asks me to go, when word comes in from one place or another;[375] and there are those who sit beside me and question me over[376] particulars, whether they are grieving for a lord long absent,[377] or are happy at eating up his substance without recompense.[378] But I have no liking for this inquiry and asking of questions,[379] since that time an Aitolian man beguiled me by telling[380] a story. This one had killed a man and wandered over[381] much country. He came to my house and I entertained him fondly.[382] He said he had seen him with Idomeneus, among the Cretan[383] men, repairing his ships, for the stormwinds had smashed them,[384] and he said he would be coming back, in the summer or autumn,[385] bringing in many possessions, and with his godlike companions.[386] You too, old man of many sorrows, since the spirit brought you[387] here to me, do not try to please me nor spell me with lying[388] words. It is not for that I will entertain and befriend you,[389] but for fear of Zeus, the god of guests, and for my own pity.”[390] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[391] “Truly, the mind in you is something very suspicious.[392] Not even with an oath can I bring you round, nor persuade you.[393] Come now, we two shall make an agreement, and for the future[394] the gods who hold Olympos shall be witnesses to both sides.[395] As your lord makes his homecoming into his palace[396] here, you shall give me a tunic and mantle to wear, and send me[397] on my way to Doulichion, where my heart has been desiring[398] to go; but if your lord never comes in the way I tell you[399] he will, set your serving men on me, and throw me over a high cliff,[400] so the next vagabond will be careful, and not lie to you.”[401] Then in turn the glorious swineherd spoke to him in answer:[402] “That would be virtuous of me, my friend, and good reputation[403] would be mine among men, for present time alike and hereafter,[404] if first I led you into my shelter, there entertained you[405] as guest, then murdered you and ravished the dear life from you.  p 444  [406] Then cheerfully I could go and pray to Zeus, son of Kronos.[407] But now it is time for our dinner, and I hope my companions come in[408] soon, so we can prepare a good dinner here in my shelter.”[409] So these two remained conversing this way together,[410] and the sows came up, and with them came the men who were swineherds,[411] and they penned the sows for the night inside their accustomed places,[412] and an endless clamor went up from the crowding swine. Thereafter[413] the glorious swineherd gave the word to his own companions:[414] “Bring in the best of the pigs, to sacrifice for our stranger[415] guest from afar, and we ourselves shall enjoy it, we who[416] long have endured this wretched work for the pigs with shining[417] teeth, while others at no cost eat up what we have worked on.”[418] So he spoke, and with the pitiless bronze split kindling,[419] and the men brought in a pig, five years old and a very fat one,[420] and made it stand in front of the fireplace, nor did the swineherd[421] forget the immortal gods, for he had the uses of virtue;[422] but he cut off hairs from the head of the white-toothed pig, and threw them[423] into the fire as dedication, and prayed to all the gods[424] that Odysseus of the many designs should have his homecoming.[425] He hit the beast with a split of oak that he had lying by him.[426] The breath went out of the pig; then they slaughtered him and singed him,[427] then jointed the carcass, and the swineherd laid pieces of raw meat[428] with offerings from all over the body upon the thick fat,[429] and sprinkled these with meal of barley and threw them in the fire, then[430] they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them,[431] and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces,[432] and laid it all together on platters. The swineherd[433] stood up to divide the portions, for he was fair minded,[434] and separated all the meat into seven portions.[435] One he set aside, with a prayer, for the nymphs and Hermes,[436] the son of Maia, and the rest he distributed to each man,[437] but gave Odysseus in honor the long cuts of the chine’s portion[438] of the white-toothed pig, and so exalted the heart of his master.[439] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke to him and addressed him:[440] “I wish, Eumaios, you could be as dear to our father[441] Zeus as to me, when I am so poor, but you grace me with good things.”[442] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[443] “Eat, my guest, strange man that you are, and take your pleasure[444] of what is here now; the god will give you such, or will let it[445] be, as in his own mind he may wish. He can do anything.”[446] He spoke, and sacrificed first-offerings to the immortal[447] gods, then poured bright wine for Odysseus, sacker of cities,[448] and put the cup in his hands, and sat down to his own portion.[449] Mesaulios served the bread to them, a man whom the swineherd[450] owned himself by himself and apart from his absent master,[451] and independently of his mistress and aged Laertes,[452] having bought him from the Taphians with his own possessions.[453] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[454] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[455] Mesaulios took the food away again, and they made haste[456] to go to bed, filled with bread and meat to repletion.[457] A bad night came on, the dark of the moon, and Zeus rained  p 445  [458] all night long, and the West Wind blew big, always watery.[459] Odysseus spoke among them. He was trying it out on the swineherd,[460] to see if he might take off his mantle and give it him, or tell[461] one of his men to do it, since he cared for him so greatly:[462] “Hear me now, Eumaios and all you other companions.[463] What I say will be a bit of boasting. The mad wine tells me[464] to do it. Wine sets even a thoughtful man to singing,[465] or sets him into softly laughing, sets him to dancing.[466] Sometimes it tosses out a word that was better unspoken.[467] But now I have broken into loud speech I will not suppress it.[468] I wish I were young again and the strength still steady within me,[469] as when, under Troy, we formed an ambush detail and led it.[470] The leaders were Odysseus and Atreus’ son, Menelaos,[471] and I made a third leader with them, since they themselves asked me.[472] But when we had come underneath the city and the steep wall,[473] we, all about the city in marshy ground and the dense growth[474] of swamp grass and the reeds, and huddling under our armor,[475] lay there, and a bad night came on with a rush of the North Wind[476] freezing, and from above came a fall of snow, chilling[477] like frost, and on the shields’ edges the ice formed, rimming them.[478] There all the other men were wearing both mantles and tunics,[479] and they slept at ease, pulling their great shields over their shoulders,[480] but I, in my carelessness when I started with my companions,[481] had left my mantle; I never thought I would be so cold,[482] but went along with only my shield and my shining waist guard.[483] But when it was the third time of the night and after the star change,[484] then I spoke to Odysseus, for he was lying next me,[485] nudging him with my elbow, and he listened at once. I said:[486] ‘Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[487] I shall no longer be left among the living. The weather[488] is too much for me. I have no mantle. The spirit made me[489] silly, to go half-dressed, and now there is no escape for me.’[490] So I spoke, and he immediately had an idea[491] in his mind, such a man he was for counseling, as for fighting.[492] He spoke to me in a little voice and said a word to me:[493] ‘Be quiet now, let no other of the Achaians hear you.’[494] Then he propped his head on his elbow and spoke a word, out loud:[495] ‘Hear me, friends. In my sleep a divine dream came to me.[496] We have come too far away from the ships. Now, would there be someone[497] to tell Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, shepherd of the people,[498] so he might send more of the men by the ships to come here to us?’[499] So he spoke, and Thoas sprang up, the son of Andraimon,[500] quickly, and took off and laid aside his red mantle,[501] and went on the run for the ships, and I lay down in his clothes,[502] happily, and rested until Dawn of the golden throne came.[503] I wish I were young like that and the strength still steady within me.[504] Some one of the swineherds in this house would give me a mantle,[505] both for love and out of respect for a strong warrior.[506] Now they slight me because I wear vile clothing upon me.”[507] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[508] “Old sir, that was a blameless fable the way you told it;[509] and you have made no unprofitable speech, nor one that  p 446  [510] missed the point, so you shall not lack for clothes, nor anything[511] rightfully due the unhappy suppliant who approaches us.[512] For now, that is. You must flaunt your rags again in the morning.[513] There are not many extra mantles and extra tunics[514] here to change into. There is only one set for each man.[515] When, however, the dear son of Odysseus comes back,[516] he will give you a mantle and tunic to wear as clothing,[517] and send you wherever your heart and spirit desire to be sent.”[518] So he spoke, and sprang up, and laid a bed for him next to[519] the fire, and threw the fleeces of sheep and goats over it.[520] There Odysseus lay down, and he threw over him a mantle[521] that was great and thick, which he kept by him as an extra covering[522] to wrap in when winter weather came on and was too rigorous.[523] So there Odysseus went to bed and the young men beside him[524] lay down also to go to sleep. Only the swineherd[525] did not please to leave his pigs, and go to bed indoors,[526] but made preparations as he went out; and Odysseus was happy[527] that his livelihood was so well cared for while he was absent.[528] First the swineherd slung his sharp sword on his heavy shoulders,[529] and put a very thick mantle about him, to keep the wind out,[530] and took up also the hairy skin of a great, well-conditioned[531] goat, and took up a sharp javelin as a protection[532] against men and dogs, and went to sleep where his pigs, with shining[533] teeth, lay in the hollow of a rock, sheltered from the North Wind.book fifteen[1] At this time, Pallas Athene made her way into wide-spaced[2] Lakedaimon, to remind the shining son of great-hearted[3] Odysseus of his journey home, and speed his homecoming.[4] She found Telemachos there with the glorious son of Nestor,[5] sleeping in the forecourt of worshipful Menelaos.[6] Indeed, the son of Nestor was held fast in the softening[7] sleep, but the sweet sleep was not on Telemachos, wakeful[8] through the immortal night, with anxious thoughts of his father.[9] Gray-eyed Athene stood close by his head and addressed him:[10] “Telemachos, it no longer becomes you to stray off so far[11] from home, leaving your possessions behind and men in your palace[12] who are so overbearing. You must not let them divide up[13] and eat up all your substance, and make your journey a vain one.[14] So urge Menelaos of the great war cry with all speed to give you[15] conveyance, so you will find your stately mother is still there[16] at home, since now her father and her brothers are urgent with her[17] to marry Eurymachos. He is outdoing the rest of suitors[18] in the giving of gifts, and has been piling up presents to win her.[19] No property must go out of the house, unless you consent to it.[20] For you know what the mind is like in the breast of a woman.[21] She wants to build up the household of the man who marries her,[22] and of former children, and of her beloved and wedded husband,[23] she has no remembrance, when he is dead, nor does she think of him.[24] For yourself, when you come back, you should turn over everything  p 447  [25] to whichever one of the serving women seems to be the best one,[26] until the gods show who is to be your honored wife. Also[27] you should put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[28] The best men of the suitors are lying in wait, on purpose,[29] for you in the passage between rocky Samos and Ithaka,[30] longing to kill you, before you come back to your own country.[31] But I think they will not achieve it. Sooner the earth will close over[32] some one of the suitors, they who are eating away your substance.[33] But you must keep your well-made ship away from the islands,[34] and sail with the night, and that one of the immortals who watches[35] over you and guards you will send a following stern wind.[36] But when you make land, at the first promontory on Ithaka,[37] then speed your ship and all your companions along to the city,[38] but you yourself go first of all to the swineherd, that man[39] who is in charge of the pigs, and whose thoughts toward you are kindly.[40] There spend the night, but speed the man along to the city[41] to take your message to circumspect Penelope, saying[42] that you are alive and safe, and you have come home from Pylos.”[43] So she spoke, and then went away, back to tall Olympos,[44] and Telemachos wakened Nestor’s son out of his sweet sleep,[45] stirring him with a nudge of his heel, and spoke a word to him:[46] “Wake, Peisistratos, son of Nestor, and bring your solid-hoofed[47] horses under the yoke to harness, so we can start back.”[48] Peisistratos, the son of Nestor, said to him in answer:[49] “Telemachos, though we long for the journey, surely we cannot[50] drive through the dark of the night, but it will be daylight presently.[51] But wait until the hero, the son of Atreus, spear-famed[52] Menelaos, brings you his gifts to put in the chariot,[53] and speaks to us, and with kind words sends us away on our journey.[54] For a guest remembers all his days the man who received him[55] as a host receives a guest, and gave him the gifts of friendship.”[56] So he spoke, and soon after Dawn of the golden throne came,[57] and, rising up from his bed where he lay by sweet-haired Helen,[58] Menelaos of the great war cry came and stood near them.[59] As soon then as the dear son of Odysseus noted him,[60] he made haste to slip the shimmering tunic over[61] his skin, and the hero threw a great mantle over his heavy[62] shoulders, and went to the door, and stood by his host and addressed him,[63] he, Telemachos, the dear son of godlike Odysseus:[64] “Great Menelaos, son of Atreus, leader of the people,[65] now send me on my way at last to my own dear country,[66] for now the heart within me longs for the homeward journey.”[67] Then in turn Menelaos of the great war cry answered:[68] “Telemachos, I for my part never will long detain you[69] here when you strain for home. I would disapprove of another[70] hospitable man who was excessive in friendship,[71] as of one excessive in hate. In all things balance is better.[72] It is equally bad when one speeds on the guest unwilling[73] to go, and when he holds back one who is hastening. Rather[74] one should befriend the guest who is there, but speed him when he wishes.[75] Yet stay, until I can bring you fine gifts to put in your chariot,[76] and you can look at them with your eyes, while I tell the women  p 448  [77] to prepare a dinner out of what we have here in abundance.[78] For there is both honor and brilliance in it, and there also is profit,[79] to dine, then go a long way over the endless earth. Therefore,[80] if you wish to make a tour through Hellas and midmost Argos,[81] and have me go myself with you, I will harness my horses[82] and be your guide through the cities of men, and there will be no one[83] who will send us away just as we are, but each one will give us[84] one thing to carry away with us, some tripod or caldron[85] well wrought in bronze, or a pair of mules, or a golden goblet.”[86] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[87] “Great Menelaos, son of Atreus, leader of the people,[88] I wish now to go back to our country for I left behind me[89] no one when I went, to look after my own possessions.[90] I must not, going in search of my godlike father, ruin[91] myself, or have some stored-up treasure lost from my palace.”[92] But as soon as Menelaos of the great war cry had heard this,[93] immediately he told his wife and all the maidservants[94] to prepare a dinner out of what was there in abundance;[95] and, risen from his bed, Eteoneus the son of Boethoös[96] came to them, since he had his own dwelling not far from them.[97] Menelaos of the great war cry told him to kindle[98] the fire and roast the meat, nor did the man disobey him.[99] Meanwhile he himself went into the fragrant chamber,[100] not alone, but Megapenthes and Helen went with him.[101] But when they came to the place where they had their treasures stored,[102] the son of Atreus took up the goblet, handled on both sides,[103] and told Megapenthes to carry the mixing bowl, that was made[104] of silver; but Helen went to stand by the storing boxes,[105] where there were elaborately wrought robes. She herself had made them.[106] And Helen, shining among women, lifted out one of them,[107] that which was the loveliest in design and the largest[108] and shone like a star. It lay beneath the others. She went on[109] her way, further and out through the house, until she came to[110] Telemachos; then fair-haired Menelaos said to him:[111] “Telemachos, may Zeus, loud-thundering husband of Hera,[112] accomplish your homeward journey in the way that your heart desires it.[113] Of all those gifts that lie stored away in my house I will give you[114] the one which is most splendid and esteemed at the highest value.[115] I will give you a fashioned mixing bowl. It is of silver,[116] all but the edges, and these are finished in gold. This is[117] the work of Hephaistos. The hero Phaidimos, the Sidonians’[118] king, gave it to me, when his house took me in and sheltered me[119] there, on my way home. I would give it to you for a present.”[120] So speaking, the hero, Atreus’ son, put the handled goblet[121] into his hands, and meanwhile strong Megapenthes carried[122] out the mixing bowl gleaming with silver and set it[123] before them. Helen of the fair cheeks stood by, holding[124] the robe in her hands, and spoke to him and named him, saying:[125] “I too give you this gift, dear child: something to remember[126] from Helen’s hands, for your wife to wear at the lovely occasion[127] of your marriage. Until that time let it lie away in your palace,[128] in your dear mother’s keeping; and I hope you come back rejoicing[129] to your own strong-founded house and to the land of your fathers.”  p 449  [130] So speaking, she put it in his hands, and he gladly received it.[131] The hero Peisistratos took the presents and packed them into[132] the carrying basket, and in his own mind admired everything.[133] Fair-haired Menelaos led them back into his palace,[134] and the two young men seated themselves on chairs and benches.[135] A maidservant brought water for them and poured it from a splendid[136] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin[137] for them to wash, and she pulled a polished table before them.[138] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to them,[139] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions,[140] and the son of Boethoös carved the meat and served out the portions,[141] while the son of glorious Menelaos poured the wine for them.[142] They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[143] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[144] then Telemachos and the glorious son of Nestor[145] harnessed the horses and mounted up into the chariot bright with[146] bronze, and drove them out the front door and the echoing portico.[147] But fair-haired Menelaos the son of Atreus followed,[148] bearing in his right hand a golden cup that was filled with[149] wine as sweet as honey, so they could pour a libation[150] as they went. He stood before the chariot and spoke and pledged them:[151] “Farewell, young men; give my greeting to the shepherd of the people,[152] Nestor, for always he was kind to me like a father,[153] when we sons of the Achaians were fighting in Troy land.”[154] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[155] “Surely, illustrious sir, when we arrive we shall tell him[156] all that you say, and I wish that even so I too, arriving[157] in Ithaka, could find Odysseus there in our palace,[158] and tell him I was returning from you, having had all loving[159] treatment, and bringing many excellent treasures given me.”[160] As he spoke a bird flew by on the right, an eagle[161] carrying in his talons a great white goose he had caught[162] tame from the yard, and all of them, men and women, with stopped breath[163] followed his flight; but the eagle, as he approached them,[164] shot by on the right before the chariot, and they seeing[165] were filled with joy and the hearts in all of them were softened.[166] First of them to speak was Peisistratos, son of Nestor:[167] “Menelaos, illustrious, leader of the people, tell us[168] whether the god showed this sign for you, or was it for us two?”[169] So he spoke, and warlike Menelaos was pondering[170] how to speak his thoughts the right way and give them an answer;[171] but Helen of the light robes anticipated him, saying:[172] “Hear me! I shall be your prophet, the way the immortals[173] put it into my heart, and I think it will be accomplished.[174] As this eagle came down from the mountain, where was his origin[175] and parentage, and caught the goose that was nursed in the household,[176] so Odysseus, after wandering long and suffering[177] much, will come home and take revenge; or he is already[178] home, and making a plan of evil for all of the suitors.”[179] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[180] “May Zeus, high thundering husband of Hera, so appoint it.[181] Then even at home I would make my prayers to you, as to a goddess.”[182] He spoke, and laid the lash on his horses, and they very quickly  p 450  [183] and with eager spirit dashed away to the plain, through the city.[184] All day long they shook the yoke they wore on their shoulders.[185] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.[186] They came to Pherai and reached the house of Diokles, who was[187] son of Ortilochos, whom Alpheios once had childed.[188] There they slept the night and he gave them hospitality.[189] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[190] they yoked the horses again and mounted the chariots bright with[191] bronze, and drove them out the front door and the echoing portico,[192] and he whipped them into a run and they winged their way unreluctant.[193] Presently they approached the sheer citadel of Pylos,[194] and then Telemachos spoke a word to the son of Nestor:[195] “Son of Nestor, would you accept what I say and bring it[196] to pass? For you and I can avow ourselves friends forever[197] because of our fathers’ love, and the two of us are the same age,[198] and this journey of ours will add to the feeling we have for each other.[199] Then do not take me, illustrious, past my ship, but leave me[200] there, for fear the old man in his affection will keep me[201] in his house longer than I wish. But I must make my way quickly.”[202] He spoke, and the son of Nestor pondered the thought within him,[203] how he could fairly undertake this and see it accomplished.[204] In the division of his heart this way seemed best to him.[205] He turned the horses toward the fast ship and the sand of the seashore,[206] and onto the stern of the ship unloaded the beautiful presents,[207] the clothing and the gold, which Menelaos had given,[208] and spoke, speeding him on his way, and addressed him in winged words:[209] “Go aboard now in haste, and urge on all your companions[210] to go, before I reach home and take the news to the old man.[211] For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it,[212] how overbearing his anger will be, and he will not let you[213] go, but will come himself to summon you, and I do not think[214] he will go away without you. As it is, he will be very angry.”[215] So he spoke, and drove away his bright-maned horses[216] back to the city of the Pylians, and reached his home quickly.[217] Telemachos then gave the sign and urged his companions:[218] “Put all running gear in order, friends, on the black ship,[219] and let us ourselves go aboard, so we can get on with the journey.”[220] So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him,[221] and quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks.[222] So, while he was busy with prayer and sacrifice to Athene[223] beside the stern of the ship, there came to him an outlander[224] from Argos, where he had killed a man; now he was a fugitive.[225] He was a prophet, and by blood was of the stock of Melampous.[226] Melampous once had lived in Pylos, mother of sheepflocks,[227] a rich man among the Pylians, at home in his high house;[228] but then he came to the land of other men, fleeing his country[229] and great-hearted Neleus, the proudest of all men living,[230] who until a year was fulfilled kept much of his substance[231] by force, for Melampous meanwhile in the halls of Phylakos[232] was held in constraint of wearisome bondage, suffering strong pains[233] for the sake of Neleus’ daughter, and the bitter infatuation[234] which the goddess Erinys, wrecker of houses, inflicted upon him.  p 451  [235] Yet he escaped death, and drove away the loud-lowing cattle[236] from Phylake to Pylos, and achieved the unjust labor[237] godlike Neleus imposed on him, and led back the lady[238] to his brother’s house; but he himself went to the land of others,[239] to horse-pasturing Argos, since now it was ordained for him[240] that he should live there and be lord over many Argives.[241] And there he too married a wife and established a high-roofed[242] house, and had children, Mantios and Antiphates, strong sons.[243] Antiphates had a son; this was great-hearted Oïkles.[244] His son was Amphiaraos, leader of storming armies,[245] whom Zeus of the aegis loved in his heart, as did Apollo,[246] with every favor, but he never came to the doorsill of old age,[247] but perished in Thebes, because his wife had been bribed with presents.[248] He in turn had sons, Amphilochos and Alkmaion.[249] The children born to Mantios were Polypheides and Kleitos,[250] but Dawn of the golden throne carried Kleitos away, because of[251] his beauty, so that he might dwell among the immortals;[252] but Apollo made high-hearted Polypheides a prophet,[253] and far the best among mortals, after Amphiaraos[254] had died. He, angered with his father, in Hyperesia[255] lived and was lord, and there he was a prophet for all men.[256] It was this man’s son, by name Theoklymenos, who now[257] came to Telemachos and stood near, and there he found him[258] pouring libation and praying beside his fast black vessel.[259] He came and spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words:[260] “Dear friend, since I have found you in this place, making sacrifice,[261] I entreat you, first by these rites and spirit, then also[262] by your own head and by your companions, who travel with you,[263] tell me truly this thing that I ask you, and hold back nothing:[264] What man are you and whence? Where is your city? Your parents?”[265] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[266] “Friend, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[267] Ithaka is my country, and Odysseus is my father,[268] if ever he lived; but by now he must have died by a dismal[269] death. So, taking my black ship and with my companions,[270] I have come for news of my father who has been so long absent.”[271] Then godlike Theoklymenos said to him in answer:[272] “So I too am out of my country, because I have killed[273] a man of my tribe, but he had many brothers and relatives[274] in horse-pasturing Argos, with great power among the Achaians.[275] Avoiding death at the hands of these men and black doom, I am[276] a fugitive, since it is my fate to be a wanderer[277] among men. Give me a place in your ship, since I have come to you[278] as a suppliant, lest they kill me; for now I think they are after me.”[279] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[280] “I will not willingly thrust you away from my balanced ship. Come, then,[281] with me. There you will be entertained, from what we have left.”[282] So Telemachos spoke, and took the bronze spear from him,[283] and laid it at length upon the deck of the oarswept vessel.[284] Then he himself mounted on board the seagoing vessel[285] and took his seat on the stern deck, and next him he seated[286] Theoklymenos, and now the men cast off the stern cables.  p 452  [287] Telemachos then gave the sign and urged his companions[288] to lay hold of the tackle, and they listened to his urging,[289] and raising the mast pole made of fir they set it upright[290] in the hollow hole in the box, and made it fast with forestays,[291] and with halyards strongly twisted of leather pulled up the white sails.[292] The goddess gray-eyed Athene sent them a favoring stern wind[293] blustering stormily through the bright air, so that with all speed[294] the ship might run the whole of her course through the sea’s salt water.[295] They ran past Krounoi, and past Chalkis on the fair waters.[296] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.[297] Pressing on before the wind from Zeus, she ran past Pheai,[298] and on past shining Elis, where the Epeians are lords; then[299] Telemachos set her course over toward the Pointed Islands,[300] as he pondered whether he would escape death, or be captured.[301] But now in the shelter Odysseus and the noble swineherd[302] were eating their evening meal, and the rest of the men with them.[303] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[304] Odysseus spoke to them, making trial of the swineherd, to see[305] if he was truly his friend and would invite him to stay on[306] in his steading as he was, or would urge him to go to the city:[307] “Hear me now, Eumaios, and all you other companions.[308] I am very eager to make my way at dawn to the city[309] and beg there, so I will not wear you out, and your men. Only[310] advise me well, and send a good guide to go along with me[311] and see me there. Once in the town I must even go begging[312] in my need, for someone to hand me a bit of bread or a cupful.[313] Then I would go into the house of godlike Odysseus[314] with a message for circumspect Penelope, to tell her;[315] and I would mingle with the overbearing suitors, to see[316] if they, who have good things in great numbers, would give me a dinner.[317] Soon I would do good work for them, whatever they wanted.[318] For I tell you this, listen to me and understand me:[319] by grace of Hermes, the guide, who dispenses glory[320] and beauty upon the endeavors of all men, I am such a one[321] for work with my hands that no other man alive could compete[322] with me for building a good fire, for splitting up kindling,[323] for carving the meat or roasting the meat or filling the wine cups,[324] for all such work as meaner men bestow on their betters.”[325] Then, deeply troubled, you said to him, O swineherd Eumaios:[326] “O my guest, what is this idea that has come now into[327] your head? Are you utterly bent on achieving your own destruction[328] there, if you mean to lose yourself in that swarm of suitors[329] whose outrageous violence goes up into the iron[330] sky? For nothing like you are the serving men who work for them,[331] but young men, and well dressed in mantles and tunics, always[332] with neat oiled heads and handsome faces. These are the people[333] who serve under the suitors, and their well-polished tables[334] are heavily loaded with bread and meats and wine. No, rather[335] stay here. There is none here who is annoyed by your presence,[336] neither myself nor any companion whom I have with me.[337] When, however, the dear son of Odysseus comes back,[338] he will give you a mantle and tunic to wear as clothing,[339] and send you wherever your heart and spirit desire to be sent.”  p 453  [340] Then much-enduring great Odysseus said to him in answer:[341] “I wish, Eumaios, you could be as dear to our father[342] Zeus as to me, since you stopped my wandering and my terrible[343] sorrow. There is nothing worse for mortal men than the vagrant[344] life, but still for the sake of the cursed stomach people[345] endure hard sorrows, when roving and pain and grief befall them.[346] But now, since you keep such a man as I am, and bid me stay here,[347] come then, tell me about the mother of godlike Odysseus,[348] and his father, whom when he went he left on the doorsill[349] of old age. Are they still alive in the beams of the sunlight,[350] or are they dead by now and gone to the house of Hades?”[351] The swineherd, leader of men, then said to him in answer:[352] “So, my friend and guest, I will give you an accurate answer.[353] Laertes is still alive, but all the time he is praying[354] to Zeus that the spirit will leave his body in his own palace;[355] for terribly he mourns over the son who is absent,[356] and for his wedded virtuous wife, whose death has hurt him[357] more than all else, and gave him to a green untimely[358] old age. She died of grieving over her glorious son, by[359] a dismal death; I hope that no friend who lives here with me[360] dies such a death, nor any who does me the acts of friendship.[361] Now while she was still alive, in spite of her grieving,[362] it was my pleasure to try her out and to ask her questions,[363] because she brought me up along with her stately daughter,[364] Ktimene of the light robes, the youngest child. We two[365] grew up together, and I was only a little less favored.[366] But when we had both arrived at our lovely prime, they gave her[367] away for marriage, in Same, and for her were given numberless[368] gifts; but the lady gave me a mantle and tunic, excellent[369] clothing she put upon me, and giving me sandals for my feet[370] sent me to the estate. From the heart she loved me dearly.[371] Now I go lacking all these things, but the blessed immortals[372] prosper all the work that I myself do abiding[373] here, whence I eat and drink and give to people I honor;[374] but there is no sweet occasion now to hear from my mistress[375] in word or fact, since the evil has fallen upon our household,[376] these overbearing men, and greatly the serving people[377] miss the talk in their mistress’ presence, the asking of questions[378] and eating and drinking there, then something to take home with them[379] to the country—which always warms the hearts of the serving people.”[380] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[381] “You must have been very little then, O swineherd Eumaios,[382] when you wandered far away from your own country and your parents.[383] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[384] Was there some storming of your wide-wayed city of people,[385] where your father and the lady your mother lived, or were you[386] caught alone beside your sheep and your cattle? And was it[387] enemy men who carried you in their ships and sold you[388] here in this man’s house, being paid a fair price for you?”[389] The swineherd, leader of men, then said to him in answer:[390] “My guest, since indeed you are asking me all these questions,[391] listen in silence and take your pleasure, and sit there drinking[392] your wine. These nights are endless, and a man can sleep through them,  p 454  [393] or he can enjoy listening to stories, and you have no need[394] to go to bed before it is time. Too much sleep is only[395] a bore. And of the others, any one whose heart and spirit[396] urge him can go outside and sleep, and then, when the dawn shows,[397] breakfast first, then go out to tend the swine of our master.[398] But we two, sitting here in the shelter, eating and drinking,[399] shall entertain each other remembering and retelling[400] our sad sorrows. For afterwards a man who has suffered[401] much and wandered much has pleasure out of his sorrows.[402] So I will tell you now the answer to all your questions.[403] There is an island, called Syria, you may have heard of it,[404] lying above Ortygia, where the sun makes his turnings;[405] not so much a populous island, but a good one, good for[406] cattle and good for sheep, full of vineyards, and wheat raising.[407] No hunger ever comes on these people, nor any other[408] hateful sickness, of such as befall wretched humanity;[409] but when the generations of men grow old in the city,[410] Apollo of the silver bow, and Artemis with him,[411] comes with a visitation of painless arrows, and kills them.[412] There are two cities, and everything is divided between them,[413] and over both of these cities there was one king, my father,[414] Ktesios, Ormenos’ son, in the likeness of the immortals.[415] “There came Phoenician men, famous seafarers, gnawers[416] at other men’s goods, with countless pretty things stored in their black ship.[417] Now in my father’s house there was a Phoenician woman,[418] both beautiful and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork,[419] and yet these Phoenicians, subtle men in their talk, beguiled her.[420] First of all, when she went out washing, one of them lay with her[421] in love’s embrace by the hollow ship, which for female women[422] is a heart’s beguilement, even for the one who is a skilled worker.[423] Then he asked her who and whence she was. She readily[424] told them all about the high-roofed house of her father:[425] ‘I claim that I come from Sidon, rich in bronze; I am daughter[426] of Arybas, who has rivers of wealth, but men from Taphos,[427] pirates, caught me and carried me away as I came back[428] home from the fields, and carried me to this place and sold me[429] here in this man’s house, being paid a fair price for me.’[430] “Then the man who had lain with her secretly said to her:[431] ‘Would you then be willing to go back home again with us,[432] to see once more the high-roofed house of your father and mother[433] and themselves too? For they are still alive, and called wealthy.’[434] “Then in turn the woman answered them and said to them:[435] ‘That also could be done if you, sailors, were willing[436] to assure me by an oath that you would take me home safely.’[437] “So she spoke, and all of them swore to this, as she asked them.[438] But when they had sworn the oath, and made an end of their swearing,[439] then once again the woman spoke to them and said to them:[440] ‘Silence, now. None of your companions must say anything[441] to me, when he happens to meet me in the street, or else[442] perhaps at the spring; somebody might go to the house and tell it[443] to the old man, and he might be suspicious, and bind me[444] in painful bondage, and plan destruction against the rest of you.  p 455  [445] But keep the word in your hearts, and get on with buying your homeward[446] cargo. But when your ship is loaded with goods, then let there[447] be someone sent to me at the house with word of it, quickly.[448] For I will bring you gold, whatever I can lay my hand on.[449] And there is another thing I would willingly give you, to pay for[450] my way home. I am nurse to the man’s son in his palace,[451] such a cunning child, as he runs around outside. If I[452] could take him aboard your ship, he would bring you a price beyond counting,[453] wherever you might sell him among alien-speaking people.’[454] “So she spoke, and went away back to the splendid palace,[455] and they, with their hollow ship, for the whole of a year remaining[456] in our country, traded and piled up much substance.[457] But when at last their hollow ship was loaded for sailing,[458] they sent their messenger, to bring the news to the woman.[459] There came a knowledgeable man to the house of my father,[460] with a golden necklace, and it was strung with pieces of amber.[461] Now in the hall the serving women with the lady my mother[462] were turning it in their hands and eying it and offering[463] to buy it, and the man nodded silently to the woman, then[464] after nodding to her he went away to the hollow[465] ship, and she took my hand and led me out of the palace.[466] There in the forecourt she came upon the cups and the tables[467] of men who had been feasting, associates of my father,[468] but these had gone to a session and debate of the people.[469] She snatched three goblets and hid them in the fold of her bosom,[470] and carried them off, and I in my innocence went with her.[471] And the sun set, and all the journeying ways were darkened.[472] Walking fast, we made our way to the glorious harbor,[473] where lay the fast-running ship of the men from Phoenicia.[474] They then putting out went over the ways of the water[475] after taking us aboard, and Zeus sent a wind to follow.[476] Thus it was that for six days, night and day, we sailed on,[477] but when Zeus, son of Kronos, had brought on the seventh[478] day, Artemis of the showering arrows struck down the woman,[479] and she dropped with a splash, like a diving tern, in the hull’s bilge. They then[480] threw her overboard to be the spoil of the fishes[481] and seals, while I was left alone, heart full of sorrow;[482] and the wind and the current carried the men and brought them to Ithaka,[483] where Laertes bought me for himself with his own possessions.[484] Thus it was that I came to set eyes on this country.”[485] In turn illustrious Odysseus gave him an answer:[486] “Eumaios, you have deeply stirred the spirit within me[487] by telling me all these things, the sorrows your heart has suffered.[488] But beside the sorrow Zeus has placed some good for you, seeing[489] that after much suffering you came into the house of a kindly[490] man, who, as he ought to do, provides you with victuals[491] and drink, and the life you lead is a good one. But I come to you[492] only after much wandering in the cities of people.”[493] So now these two were conversing thus with each other,[494] then slept, but not for very much time, only for a little,  p 456  [495] since soon the glorious dawn came on. Ashore, Telemachos’[496] companions now loosened the sails, and took down the mast tree,[497] easily, and rowed her in with oars to the mooring.[498] They threw over the anchor stones and made fast the stern cables,[499] and themselves stepped out onto the break of the sea beach,[500] and then made ready their dinner, and mixed the bright wine with water.[501] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[502] then the thoughtful Telemachos began their discourse:[503] “The rest of you now take the black ship on to the city,[504] while I go out to visit the estate and the herdsmen.[505] In the evening, when I have looked at the holdings, I will come back[506] to town. I will set a good feast before you, meats and sweet-tasting[507] wine, to be my thanks for sharing the journey with me.”[508] Then in turn godlike Theoklymenos said to him:[509] “Where shall I go then, dear child? Of men who are lords here[510] in rocky Ithaka, who is there whose house I can visit?[511] Or shall I go straight to the house where you live, and to your mother?”[512] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[513] “Were things otherwise, indeed I would urge you to visit[514] our house; we lack no means as hosts, and yet for yourself[515] it would be worse, for I shall be absent, nor will my mother[516] see you; with suitors there in the house she does not often[517] appear, but stays in the upper room and works at her weaving.[518] But I will indicate another man you could go to,[519] Eurymachos, the glorious son of prudent Polybos,[520] whom now the people of Ithaka look on as on divinity,[521] since he is their best man by far, and is the most eager[522] to marry my mother and seize the rights and powers of Odysseus;[523] but Zeus the Olympian, dwelling in the high air, knows whether[524] the evil day will end him before he can make that marriage.”[525] As he spoke, a bird flew by on the right, a falcon,[526] swift messenger of Apollo, and in his claws he carried[527] a pigeon and tore at it so that a shower of feathers[528] drifted to the ground between the ship and Telemachos.[529] Theoklymenos called him away from his other companions[530] and took him by the hand and spoke and named him, saying:[531] “Telemachos, not without a god’s will did this bird fly past you[532] on the right, for I knew when I saw it that it was a portent.[533] No other family shall be kinglier than yours in the country[534] of Ithaka, but you shall have lordly power forever.”[535] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[536] “If only this word, stranger and guest, were brought to fulfillment,[537] soon you would be aware of my love and many gifts given[538] by me, so any man who met you would call you blessed.”[539] He spoke, and said a word to Peiraios, a faithful companion:[540] “Peiraios, son of Klytios, in other ways also you follow[541] my will, beyond the other friends who went with me to Pylos.[542] So now too take this guest home to your house and give him[543] his honor due and loving attention, until I come to you.”[544] So he spoke, and spear-famed Peiraios gave him an answer:[545] “Telemachos, even if you were to stay out there for a long time,[546] we shall lack no means as hosts to this man, and I shall look after him.”  p 457  [547] So speaking he went aboard the ship and told his companions[548] also to go aboard, and to cast off the stern cables,[549] and quickly they went aboard the ship and sat to the oarlocks;[550] but under his feet Telemachos bound on his fair sandals,[551] and then caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,[552] from the ship’s deck, but the other men cast off the stern cables,[553] and pushed off and sailed away to the city, as they were asked to[554] by Telemachos, beloved son of godlike Odysseus.[555] He stepped out, and his feet took him swiftly, until he came to[556] the yard, where there were countless pigs, and near them always[557] slept the noble swineherd, with kind thoughts for his masters.book sixteen[1] These two in the shelter, Odysseus and the noble[2] swineherd, stirred the fire at dawn, and arranged their breakfast,[3] and sent the herdsmen out with the pasturing pigs. At this time[4] the clamorous dogs came fawning around Telemachos, nor did[5] they bark at him as he came, and great Odysseus noticed[6] that the dogs were fawning; above them he heard the loud noise of footsteps.[7] Immediately he spoke in winged words to Eumaios:[8] “Eumaios, someone is on his way here who is truly[9] one of yours, or else well known, since the dogs are not barking[10] but fawning about him, and I can hear the thud of his footsteps.”[11] His whole word had not been spoken when his beloved[12] son stood in the forecourt. Amazed, the swineherd started[13] up, and the vessels, where he had been busily mixing[14] the bright wine, fell from his hand. He came up to meet his master,[15] and kissed his head, and kissed too his beautiful shining[16] eyes, and both his hands, and the swelling tear fell from him.[17] And as a father, with heart full of love, welcomes his only[18] and grown son, for whose sake he has undergone many hardships[19] when he comes back in the tenth year from a distant country,[20] so now the noble swineherd, clinging fast to godlike[21] Telemachos, kissed him even as if he had escaped dying,[22] and in a burst of weeping he spoke to him in winged words:[23] “You have come, Telemachos, sweet light; I thought I would never[24] see you again, when you had gone in the ship to Pylos.[25] But come now into the house, dear child, so that I can pleasure[26] my heart with looking at you again when you are inside;[27] for you do not come very often to the estate and the herdsmen,[28] but you stay in town, since now it seems you are even minded[29] to face the deadly company of the lordly suitors.”[30] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[31] “So it shall be, my father; but it was for your sake I came here,[32] to look upon you with my eyes, and to hear a word from you,[33] whether my mother endures still in the halls, or whether[34] some other man has married her, and the bed of Odysseus[35] lies forlorn of sleepers with spider webs grown upon it.”[36] Then in turn the swineherd, leader of men, said to him:[37] “All too much with enduring heart she does wait for him  p 458  [38] there in your own palace, and always with her the wretched[39] nights and the days also waste her away with weeping.”[40] So he spoke, and took the bronze spear from him. Telemachos[41] then went inside and stepped over the sill of stone, and his father[42] Odysseus rose from his seat and yielded him place as he entered,[43] but Telemachos from the other side checked him and said to him:[44] “No, sit, my friend, and we shall find us another seat, here[45] in our own shelter; the man is here who will lay it for us.”[46] He spoke, and Odysseus went back again and sat down. The swineherd[47] strewed green brushwood and fleeces on the ground for him. There[48] the beloved son of Odysseus seated himself, and for them[49] the swineherd brought and set beside them platters of roasted[50] meat, which they had left over when they were eating earlier;[51] and hastily set bread by them, piling it in baskets,[52] and mixed the wine, as sweet as honey, in a bowl of ivy.[53] He himself sat down across from godlike Odysseus.[54] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[55] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[56] then at last Telemachos questioned the noble swineherd:[57] “Father, where did this stranger come from? How did the sailors[58] bring him to Ithaka? What men do they claim that they are?[59] For I do not think he could have traveled on foot to this country.”[60] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[61] “So, my child, I will relate you the whole true story.[62] He announces himself by birth to be one from spacious[63] Crete, but his wanderings have wheeled him through many cities[64] of mortal men, for so the divinity spun his thread for him,[65] and now this time he has fled away off a ship of Thesprotian[66] men, and come to my steading. I put him into your hands now.[67] Do with him as your will. He names himself your suppliant.”[68] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[69] “Eumaios, this word you spoke hurt my heart deeply. For how[70] shall I take and entertain a stranger guest in my house?[71] I myself am young and have no faith in my hands’ strength[72] to defend a man, if anyone else picks a quarrel with him;[73] and my mother’s heart is divided in her, and ponders two ways,[74] whether to remain here with me, and look after the household,[75] keep faith with her husband’s bed, and regard the voice of the people[76] or go away at last with the best man of the Achaians[77] who pays her court in her palace, and brings her the most presents.[78] But as for this stranger, since it is your house he has come to,[79] I will give him a mantle and tunic to wear, fine clothing,[80] and give him sandals for his feet, a sword with two edges,[81] and send him wherever his heart and spirit desire to be sent.[82] Or if you will, keep him here in your steading and look after him,[83] and I will send the clothes out here, and all provisions[84] to eat, so he will not be hard on you, nor on your companions;[85] but I will not let him go down there and be where the suitors[86] are, for their outrageousness is too strong, and I fear[87] they may insult him, and that will be a hard sorrow upon me[88] and a difficult one for even a strong man to deal with[89] among too many of them, since they will be far the stronger.”  p 459  [90] Then long-suffering great Odysseus spoke to him in answer:[91] “Dear friend, since in truth I am privileged to speak of this,[92] you eat away the dear heart in me, as I listen[93] to what you tell of the suitors and their reckless contrivings[94] inside your palace, against your will, when you are such a one[95] as you are. Tell me, are you willingly oppressed by them? Do the people[96] hate you throughout this place, swayed by some impulse given[97] from the gods? Do you find your brothers wanting? A man trusts[98] help from these in the fighting when a great quarrel arises.[99] I wish that I were truly as young as I am in spirit,[100] or a son of stately Odysseus were here, or he himself might[101] come in from his wandering. There is time still for hope. If such[102] things could be, another could strike my head from my shoulders[103] if I did not come as an evil thing to all those people[104] as I entered the palace of Odysseus, the son of Laertes.[105] And if I, fighting alone, were subdued by all their number,[106] then I would rather die, cut down in my own palace,[107] than have to go on watching forever these shameful activities,[108] guests being battered about, or to see them rudely mishandling[109] the serving women all about the beautiful palace,[110] to see them drawing the wine and eating up food in this utterly[111] reckless way, without end, forever and always at it.”[112] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[113] “So, my friend, I will tell you plainly the whole truth of it.[114] It is not that all the people hate me, nor are they angry,[115] nor is it that I find brothers wanting, whom a man trusts for[116] help in the fighting, whenever a great quarrel arises.[117] For so it is that the son of Kronos made ours a single[118] line. Arkeisios had only a single son, Laertes,[119] and Laertes had only one son, Odysseus; Odysseus in turn[120] left only one son, myself, in the halls, and got no profit[121] of me, and my enemies are here in my house, beyond numbering.[122] For all the greatest men who have the power in the islands,[123] in Doulichion and Same and in wooded Zakynthos,[124] and all who in rocky Ithaka are holders of lordships,[125] all these are after my mother for marriage, and wear my house out.[126] And she does not refuse the hateful marriage, nor is she able[127] to make an end of the matter; and these eating up my substance[128] waste it away; and soon they will break me myself to pieces.[129] Yet all these are things that are lying upon the gods’ knees.[130] Father Eumaios, go quickly now, and tell the circumspect[131] Penelope that I am safe and have come from Pylos.[132] I myself will stay here. You go there quickly, and give this[133] message to her alone, and let no other Achaian[134] hear it; for there are many there who are plotting against me.”[135] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[136] “I see, I understand; you speak to one who follows you.[137] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[138] Shall I on the same errand go with the news to wretched[139] Laertes, who while he so greatly grieved for Odysseus[140] yet would look after his farm and with the thralls in his household[141] would eat and drink, whenever the spirit was urgent with him;  p 460  [142] but now, since you went away in the ship to Pylos,[143] they say he has not eaten in this way, nor drunk anything,[144] nor looked to his farm, but always in lamentation and mourning[145] sits grieving, and the flesh on his bones is wasting from him.”[146] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[147] “Though it hurts the more, we shall let him be, for all our sorrow.[148] For if it were somehow given to mortals to have their choosing[149] in all things, we should choose my father’s day of homecoming.[150] But you, when you have given your message, come back and do not[151] go off to the estate to see him, but tell my mother[152] to tell the servant who is housekeeper to go there swiftly[153] and secretly, and she can give the news to the old man.”[154] He spoke, and started the swineherd, who in his hands took up[155] his sandals and tied them on his feet to start for the city.[156] Nor was Athene unaware that Eumaios the swineherd[157] had left the steading, but she came near, likened to a woman[158] beautiful and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork,[159] and stood in the forecourt of the shelter, seen by Odysseus.[160] But Telemachos did not look her way nor did he perceive her;[161] for the gods do not show themselves in this way to everyone;[162] but Odysseus saw her and the dogs did; they were not barking,[163] but cowered away, whimpering, to the other side of the shelter.[164] She nodded to him with her brows, and noble Odysseus[165] saw her, and came from the house, outside the great wall of the courtyard,[166] and stood in her presence. Then Athene spoke to him, saying:[167] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[168] it is time now to tell your son the story; no longer[169] hide it, so that, contriving death and doom for the suitors,[170] you two may go to the glorious city. I myself shall not[171] be long absent from you in my eagerness for the fighting.”[172] So spoke Athene, and with her golden wand she tapped him.[173] First she made the mantle and the tunic that covered[174] his chest turn bright and clean; she increased his strength and stature.[175] His dark color came back to him again, his jaws firmed,[176] and the beard that grew about his chin turned black. Athene[177] went away once more, having done her work, but Odysseus[178] went back into the shelter. His beloved son was astonished[179] and turned his eyes in the other direction, fearing this must be[180] a god, and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:[181] “Suddenly you have changed, my friend, from what you were formerly;[182] your skin is no longer as it was, you have other clothing.[183] Surely you are one of the gods who hold the high heaven.[184] Be gracious, then: so we shall give you favored offerings[185] and golden gifts that have been well wrought. Only be merciful.”[186] Then in turn long-suffering great Odysseus answered him:[187] “No, I am not a god. Why liken me to the immortals?[188] But I am your father, for whose sake you are always grieving[189] as you look for violence from others, and endure hardships.”[190] So he spoke, and kissed his son, and the tears running[191] down his cheeks splashed on the ground. Until now, he was always unyielding.[192] But Telemachos, for he did not yet believe that this was  p 461  [193] his father, spoke to him once again in answer, saying:[194] “No, you are not Odysseus my father, but some divinity[195] beguiles me, so that I must grieve the more, and be sorry.[196] For no man who was mortal could ever have so contrived it[197] by his own mind alone, not unless some immortal, descending[198] on him in person, were lightly to make him a young or an old man.[199] For even now you were an old man in unseemly clothing,[200] but now you resemble one of the gods who hold wide heaven.”[201] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[202] “Telemachos, it does not become you to wonder too much[203] at your own father when he is here, nor doubt him. No other[204] Odysseus than I will ever come back to you. But here I am,[205] and I am as you see me, and after hardships and suffering[206] much I have come, in the twentieth year, back to my own country.[207] But here you see the work of Athene, the giver of plunder,[208] who turns me into whatever she pleases, since she can do this;[209] and now she will make me look like a beggar, but then the next time[210] like a young man, and wearing splendid clothes on my body;[211] and it is a light thing for the gods who hold wide heaven[212] to glorify any mortal man, or else to degrade him.”[213] So he spoke, and sat down again, but now Telemachos[214] folded his great father in his arms and lamented,[215] shedding tears, and desire for mourning rose in both of them;[216] and they cried shrill in a pulsing voice, even more than the outcry[217] of birds, ospreys or vultures with hooked claws, whose children[218] were stolen away by the men of the fields, before their wings grew[219] strong; such was their pitiful cry and the tears their eyes wept.[220] And now the light of the sun would have set on their crying,[221] had not Telemachos spoken a quick word to his father:[222] “What kind of ship was it, father dear, in which the sailors[223] brought you to Ithaka? What men do they claim that they are?[224] For I do not think you could have traveled on foot to this country.”[225] Then long-suffering great Odysseus said to him in answer:[226] “So, my child, I will tell you all the truth. The Phaiakians[227] famed for seafaring brought me here, and they carry other[228] people as well, whoever may come into their country.[229] They brought me sleeping in their fast ship over the open[230] sea, and set me down in Ithaka, and gave me glorious[231] gifts, abundant bronze and gold and woven apparel.[232] All this, by the god’s grace, is lying stored in the caverns.[233] But now I have come to this place by the advice by Athene,[234] so we together can make our plans to slaughter our enemies.[235] Come then, tell me the number of suitors, and tell me about them,[236] so I can know how many there are, and which men are of them;[237] and then, when I have pondered it in my faultless mind, I can[238] decide whether we two alone will be able to face them[239] without any help, or whether we must go looking for others.”[240] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[241] “Oh, father, I have always heard of your great fame, and how[242] you were a fighting man with your hands, and prudent in counsel;[243] but what you have spoken of is too big; I am awed; for it could not[244] be that two men could fight against strong men in these numbers.  p 462  [245] The suitors are no simple number of ten, nor twice that,[246] but far more than that. Even now you shall hear the number[247] of those that are here. From Doulichion there are two and fifty[248] young men, choice men, and there are six thralls of their following;[249] the number of men come from Same is four and twenty,[250] and from Zakynthos there are twenty sons of the Achaians.[251] From Ithaka itself there are twelve, and all of their best men,[252] and Medon the herald is with them, and the divine singer,[253] and there are two henchmen with them, both skilled in carving. If we[254] set ourselves to fight against all who are in the palace,[255] I fear your revenge on their violence may be grim and bitter[256] for us. Then, if you can think of anyone to stand by us[257] and with forthright spirit be our protector, speak of him to me.”[258] Then in turn long-suffering great Odysseus answered him:[259] “So, then, I will tell you. Hear me and understand me[260] and consider whether Athene with Zeus father helping will be[261] enough for us, or whether I must think of some other helper.”[262] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[263] “Those indeed are two excellent helpers you name to me, even[264] though they sit high away in the clouds, for they have power[265] over others besides, over mortal men and the gods immortal.”[266] Then in turn long-suffering great Odysseus answered him:[267] “These are two who will not for a long time stay far off[268] from the strong battle, at that time when the War God’s decision[269] is fought out in our halls between ourselves and the suitors.[270] But now, as for you, you must make your way, when dawn shows,[271] back to our house, and be with the group of insolent suitors.[272] At a later time the swineherd shall take me to the city,[273] and I shall look like a dismal vagabond, and an old man.[274] But if they maltreat me within the house, then let the dear heart[275] in you even endure it, though I suffer outrage, even[276] if they drag me by the feet through the palace to throw me out of it,[277] or pelt me with missiles; you must still look on and endure it;[278] though indeed you may speak to them with soft words and entreat them[279] to give over their mad behavior, but still they will never[280] listen to you, for the day of their destiny stands near them.[281] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[282] When Athene, lady of many counsels, puts it into[283] my mind, I will nod my head to you, and when you perceive it,[284] take all the warlike weapons which are stored in the great hall,[285] and carry them off and store them away in the inward corner[286] of the high chamber; and when the suitors miss them and ask you[287] about them, answer and beguile them with soft words, saying:[288] ‘I stored them away out of the smoke, since they are no longer[289] like what Odysseus left behind when he went to Troy land,[290] but are made foul, with all the smoke of the fire upon them.[291] Also, the son of Kronos put into my head this even[292] greater thought, that with the wine in you, you might stand up[293] and fight, and wound each other, and spoil the feast and the courting,[294] since iron all of itself works on a man and attracts him.’[295] But leave behind, for you and me alone, a pair each[296] of swords and spears, and a pair of oxhide shields, to take up  p 463  [297] in our hands, and wield them, and kill these men; and Zeus of the counsels[298] and Pallas Athene will be there to maze the wits in them.[299] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[300] If truly you are my own son, and born of our own blood,[301] then let nobody hear that Odysseus is in the palace;[302] let not Laertes hear of it, neither let the swineherd;[303] let no one in the household know, not even Penelope[304] herself; you and I alone will judge the faith of the women,[305] and, besides these, we can make trial of the serving men, to see[306] whether any of them is true to us and full of humility,[307] or whether one cares nothing for you, and denies your greatness.”[308] Then in answer again his glorious son said to him:[309] “Father, I think you will learn what my spirit is like, when the time comes,[310] for the mood that is in my mind shows no slackening; only[311] I think in what you propose there will be no profit for either[312] of us, and I urge you to think well about it. You would[313] be going about our holdings, testing and learning the nature[314] of man after man, while they at their ease in the palace[315] overbearingly consume our goods, and spare nothing.[316] And yet I do urge you to find out about the women,[317] which of them care nothing for you, and which are innocent;[318] but I myself would not wish that we should go out to the steadings[319] to test the men, but this is a task to be left for later,[320] if truly you have been given some sign from Zeus of the aegis.”[321] Now as these two were conversing thus with each other,[322] the well-made vessel which had carried Telemachos, together[323] with his companions, from Pylos, now came in to Ithaka.[324] They, when they were inside the many-hollowed harbor,[325] hauled the black-hulled ship onto the dry land, high up,[326] and their high-hearted henchmen carried their armor for them,[327] and took the beautiful presents to the house of Klytios.[328] But they sent a herald on his way to the house of Odysseus[329] to take a message to circumspect Penelope, saying[330] Telemachos was in the country now, but had told them to sail[331] the ship back to the city, so the magnificent queen would not[332] be terrified within her heart, and shed the soft tears.[333] The two of them met, the herald and noble swineherd, going[334] by reason of the same message, to report to the lady.[335] But when they had come to the house of the sacred king, the herald[336] stood in the midst of the serving maids and delivered his message:[337] “Now, O queen, your beloved son is back in this country.”[338] But the swineherd stood very close to Penelope and told her[339] all the message that her beloved son had entrusted[340] to him to tell, but when he had given her all the message,[341] he went back to his pigs, leaving the palace and courtyard.[342] But the hearts of the suitors were disturbed and discouraged. They went[343] out of the palace and stood by the great wall of the courtyard,[344] and there in front of the palace gates they held an assembly.[345] First of them to speak was Eurymachos, son of Polybos:[346] “Friends, this is a monstrous thing, this voyage made by Telemachos[347] and insolently put through. We thought he would never achieve it.[348] But come, let us drag a black ship, our best one, down to the water,  p 464  [349] and assemble sailors to row it, who can with all speed carry[350] the message to give to our others and tell them to come home quickly.”[351] He had not yet said all before Amphinomos, turning[352] from his place, saw the ship inside the depths of the harbor,[353] and they had the oars now in their hands and were taking the sails down.[354] He laughed out sweetly and spoke a word then to his companions:[355] “We need send them no message now. Here they are, inside.[356] Either some god told it to them, or they themselves saw[357] the other ship pass by, and they were not able to catch her.”[358] He spoke, and they stood up and went down to the sand of the seashore,[359] and others hauled their black-hulled ship up onto the dry land,[360] and their high-hearted henchmen carried their armor for them.[361] They went in a throng to the assembly, nor did they suffer[362] any of the young men or any of the elders to sit with them.[363] Thereupon Antinoös, son of Eupeithes, addressed them:[364] “It is shameful how the gods got this man clear of misfortune.[365] In the daytime we sat watchful along the windy headlands,[366] always succeeding each other, but when the sun set, we never[367] lay through the night on the dry land, but always on the open[368] water, cruising in a fast ship, we waited for the divine dawn,[369] watching to ambush Telemachos, so that we could cut him[370] off; but all the time some divinity brought him home. Therefore,[371] we who are here must make our plans for the grim destruction[372] of Telemachos, so he cannot escape us; since I have no thought[373] we can get our present purpose accomplished while he is living.[374] For he himself is understanding in thought and counsel,[375] and the people here no longer show us their entire favor.[376] But come now, before he can gather the Achaians and bring them[377] to assembly; for I think he will not let us go, but work out[378] his anger, and stand up before them all and tell them[379] how we designed his sudden murder, but we could not catch him;[380] and they will have no praise for us when they hear of our evil[381] deeds, and I fear they will work some evil on us, and drive us[382] from our own country, so we must make for another community;[383] then let us surprise him and kill him, in the fields away from the city,[384] or in the road, and ourselves seize his goods and possessions.[385] dividing them among ourselves fairly, but give his palace[386] to his mother to keep and to the man who marries her. Or else,[387] if what I say is not pleasing to you, but you are determined[388] to have him go on living and keep his father’s inheritance,[389] then we must not go on gathering here and abundantly eating[390] away his fine substance, but from his own palace each man[391] must strive to win her with gifts of courtship; she will then marry[392] the man she is fated to have, and who brings her the greatest presents.”[393] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.[394] Now Amphinomos spoke forth and addressed them. He was[395] the shining son of Nisos, son of the lord Aretiades,[396] and led those suitors who had come over from the abundant[397] grasslands and grainlands of Doulichion, and pleased Penelope[398] more than the others in talk, for he had good sense and discretion.[399] He in kind intention toward all spoke forth and addressed them:[400] “Dear friends, I for my part would not be willing to murder  p 465  [401] Telemachos; it is terrible to kill one of royal[402] blood; we should first have to ask the gods for their counsel.[403] Then, if the ordinances of great Zeus approve of it,[404] I myself would kill him and tell all others to do so;[405] but I say we must give it up, if the gods deny us.”[406] So Amphinomos spoke, and his word was acceptable to them.[407] Then they stood up at once and went into the house of Odysseus,[408] and entering they found their polished chairs, and were seated.[409] But now circumspect Penelope thought of her next move,[410] to show herself to her overbearingly violent suitors;[411] for she had heard how they had planned her son’s death in the palace.[412] The herald, Medon, who overheard their planning, had told her.[413] She went with her attendant women into the great hall.[414] But when she, shining among women, came to the suitors,[415] she stood by the pillar that supported the roof with its joinery,[416] holding her shining veil in front of her face to shield it,[417] and spoke a word of reproach to Antinoös, naming him:[418] “Antinoös, violent man, deviser of evil: in Ithaka[419] the common account says you are the best man among your age mates[420] for speech and counsel. But you have never been such. Oh, boisterous[421] creature, why do you weave a design of death and destruction[422] for Telemachos, and take no heed of suppliants, over whom[423] Zeus stands witness? It is not right to plan harm for each other.[424] Do you not know how your father came here once, a fugitive[425] in fear of the people? These were terribly angered with him,[426] because he had thrown in his lot with the pirate Taphians[427] and harried the Thesprotians, and these were friends of our people.[428] They wanted to waste him away, to break the dear heart in him,[429] to eat up his substance and abundant livelihood. Only[430] Odysseus stayed their hand and held them, for all their fury.[431] Now you eat up his house without payment, pay court to his wedded[432] wife, try to murder his son, and do me great indignity.[433] I tell you to stop it, and ask the others to do so likewise.”[434] Eurymachos the son of Polybos spoke then answering:[435] “Daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[436] do not fear. Never let your heart be troubled for these things.[437] The man is not living, nor will there be one, nor can there ever[438] be one, who shall lay hands upon your son, Telemachos,[439] as long as I am alive on earth and look on the daylight.[440] For I tell you this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished:[441] instantly his own black blood will stain my spear point.[442] My own spear; since often Odysseus, sacker of cities,[443] would seat me also upon his knees, and put pieces of roasted[444] meat in my hands, and hold the red wine out to me. Therefore,[445] of all men Telemachos is the dearest to me[446] by far, and I tell him to go in no fear of destruction[447] from the suitors. But if it comes from the gods, there is no escaping it.”[448] So he spoke, encouraging her, but himself was planning[449] the murder. She went back to the shining upper chamber[450] and wept for Odysseus, her dear husband, until the gray-eyed[451] goddess Athene drifted a sweet sleep over her eyelids.[452] With the evening, the noble swineherd came back to Odysseus  p 466  [453] and his son. Then they stood over the evening meal to prepare it,[454] and dedicated a year-old sow; but meanwhile Athene[455] had come and stood close by Odysseus, son of Laertes,[456] and tapped him with her wand and made him once more an old man,[457] and put foul clothing upon his skin, for fear the swineherd[458] might recognize him, face to face, and go with the message[459] to circumspect Penelope, and not keep fast the secret.[460] Now Telemachos was the first who spoke a word to him:[461] “So, noble Eumaios, you have come. And what was the rumor[462] in the town? Are the haughty suitors now back from their ambush,[463] or are they still lying in wait for me on my homeward journey?”[464] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[465] “It was not on my mind to go down through the city, nor to ask,[466] nor try to find out; rather the will was urgent within me[467] to speak my message with all speed and be on my way back here.[468] But one of your fellows as a swift messenger joined my company,[469] the herald; he was the first who told the word to your mother.[470] But here is another thing I know; with my eyes I saw it.[471] I was above the city, where the Hill of Hermes is, making[472] my way along, when I saw a fast vessel coming into[473] our harbor, making inshore, and many men were aboard her,[474] and she was loaded with shields and leaf-headed spears. Then I thought[475] that these would be the men we mean, but I do not know it.”[476] So he spoke, and Telemachos, the hallowed prince, smiled[477] as he caught his father’s eye, but avoided the eyes of the swineherd.[478] They, when they had finished their work and got their feast ready,[479] feasted, nor was any man’s hunger denied a fair portion.[480] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[481] they thought of going to bed, and accepted the gift of slumber.book seventeen[1] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[2] Telemachos, beloved son of godlike Odysseus,[3] then bound underneath his feet the beautiful sandals,[4] and took up a powerful spear which fitted his hand’s grip,[5] on his way to the city, and going he spoke to his swineherd:[6] “Father, I am going to the city, so that my mother[7] will see me, since as I suppose she will never give over[8] that bitter lamentation of hers and her tearful crying[9] until she sees me myself. But here is what I will tell you[10] to do; take this unhappy stranger to the city, so that[11] there he can beg his dinner, and any who will can give him[12] his bit of bread and his cupful; it is not for me to put up with[13] everybody, now when I have troubles on my mind. Therefore,[14] even if the stranger is terribly angry, it will be only[15] the worse for him. Speaking the truth is the way I like best.”[16] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[17] “Dear friend, neither do I desire that he should detain me[18] here; a beggar is better begging his dinner in the city[19] than in the country. Whoever wants to will give me something;  p 467  [20] for I am no longer the right age to stay on the farms, the right age[21] to carry out any task the foreman imposes on me.[22] Go on then. This man, the one you have asked, will take me,[23] as soon as I have warmed myself by the fire and there is some[24] sunlight; these clothes are very poor, and I hope no morning[25] frost undoes me. They say it is very far to the city.”[26] So he spoke, but Telemachos strode out through the steading,[27] walking fast, and planning evil things for the suitors.[28] But when he had arrived at the well-settled house, he carried[29] his spear over to a tall column, and propped it against it,[30] and he himself went inside, stepping over the stone threshold.[31] Far the first to see him was his nurse, Eurykleia,[32] as she spread the fleeces on the elaborate chairs. She burst out[33] in tears, and went straight to him, and around him the other[34] serving maids of patient-hearted Odysseus clustered,[35] and made much of him, and kissed him on his head and his shoulders.[36] But now circumspect Penelope came down from her chamber,[37] looking like Artemis, or like golden Aphrodite,[38] and burst into tears, and threw her arms around her beloved[39] son, and kissed him on his head and both of his shining[40] eyes, and tearfully spoke winged words and addressed him:[41] “You have come, Telemachos, sweet light, and I thought I would never[42] see you again, when you had gone in the ship to Pylos[43] secretly, and against my will, for news of the father[44] you love. But come now, tell me what sights you have been seeing.”[45] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[46] “Mother, do not stir up a scene of sorrow, nor trouble[47] my heart once more, now I have escaped from sheer destruction;[48] but go, wash with water and put clean clothing upon your body,[49] and going on to the upper story with your attendant[50] women, vow to all the gods the service of complete[51] hecatombs, if Zeus grants requital for what is done to us.[52] But I will go to the place of meeting, so I can summon[53] my guest, who came along with me as I made my way here.[54] I sent him on ahead of me with my godlike companions,[55] and told Peiraios to take him to his own house, and give him[56] forthright honor and entertainment, until my arrival.”[57] So he spoke, and she had no winged words for an answer,[58] and she washed with water and put clean clothing upon her body,[59] and vowed to all the gods the service of complete hecatombs,[60] if Zeus were to grant requital for what had been done to them.[61] Telemachos then went striding out through the palace, and left it,[62] holding his spear, and a pair of light-footed dogs went with him.[63] Athene drifted an enchantment of grace upon him,[64] and all the people had their eyes on him as he came on.[65] Around him the haughty suitors clustered. They all were speaking[66] him fair, but in the deep of their hearts were devising evils.[67] Telemachos himself avoided their crowding numbers,[68] and where Mentor was sitting, and Antiphos and Halitherses,[69] the men who from the first had been his father’s companions,[70] there he went and sat down, and they questioned him about everything.[71] Now Peiraios the famous spearman came near them, bringing  p 468  [72] the guest through the city to the assembly, nor did Telemachos[73] stay for long far away from the guest, but came and stood by him.[74] First of the two to speak was Peiraios, who then said to him:[75] “Telemachos, have your women come to my house with all speed,[76] so I can send back the gifts which Menelaos has given you.”[77] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[78] “Peiraios, since we do not know how all this will come out,[79] or whether the haughty suitors will kill me here in my palace[80] treacherously, and divide up all my father’s possessions,[81] I wish that you yourself, or one of these men, should keep them,[82] and have the profit. But if I can plot their death and destruction,[83] bring them to my house; and there will be gratitude shown on both sides.”[84] So he spoke, and led the long-suffering stranger back to[85] his house. And when they had arrived at the well-settled palace,[86] they laid down their mantles along the chairs and the benches,[87] and stepped into the bathtubs, smooth-polished, and bathed there.[88] Then, when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil,[89] and put cloaks of thick fleece and tunics upon them, they went[90] forth from the bathing tubs, and took their places on settles.[91] A maidservant brought water for them and poured it from a splendid[92] and golden pitcher, holding it above a silver basin[93] for them to wash, and she pulled a polished table before them.[94] A grave housekeeper brought in the bread and served it to them,[95] adding many good things to it, generous with her provisions.[96] His mother sat opposite beside the pillar supporting[97] the hall, sitting back on a chair and turning fine yarn on a distaff.[98] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[99] But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,[100] it was circumspect Penelope who began their discourse:[101] “Telemachos, I will go back now to my upper chamber,[102] and lie down on my bed, which is made sorrowful, always[103] disordered with the tears I have wept, ever since Odysseus[104] went with the sons of Atreus to Troy; and you had no patience[105] to tell me—before the haughty suitors arrive at our palace—[106] any news you may have heard of your father’s homecoming.”[107] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[108] “Then, my mother, I will tell you the whole true story.[109] We went to Pylos, and to Nestor, shepherd of the people,[110] and he, in his high house, gave me hospitality, and loving[111] free attention, as a father would to his own beloved[112] son, who was newly arrived from a long voyage elsewhere. So he[113] freely took care of me, with his own glorious children.[114] But he said he had heard nothing about enduring Odysseus,[115] nor whether he was alive or dead, from any of the peoples[116] of earth. He sent me to Atreus’ son, spear-famed Menelaos,[117] giving me passage with his own horses and compact chariot.[118] There I saw Helen of Argos, for whose sake Argives and Trojans[119] had undergone much hardship by the gods’ will. Menelaos[120] of the great war cry questioned me, when I came to him,[121] and asked what need had brought me to glorious Lakedaimon;[122] whereupon I told him the whole truth of my story,[123] and he in turn spoke to me then and gave me an answer:  p 469  [124] ‘Oh, for shame, it was in the bed of a bold and strong man[125] they wished to lie, they themselves being all unwarlike.[126] As when a doe has brought her fawns to the lair of a lion,[127] and put them there to sleep, they are newborn and still suckling,[128] then wanders out into the foothills and the grassy corners,[129] grazing there, but now the lion comes back to his own lair[130] and visits a shameful destruction on both mother and children;[131] so now Odysseus will visit shameful destruction on these men.[132] O father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, I wish that[133] as he was when, upon a time, in strong-founded Lesbos[134] he stood up and wrestled Philomeleides from a challenge,[135] and threw him strongly, so delighting all the Achaians;[136] I wish that such an Odysseus would come now among the suitors.[137] They all would find death was quick and marriage a painful matter.[138] But for what you entreat me for and ask me about, I will not[139] turn away from the tale and speak idly, nor will I deceive you,[140] but of what the ever-truthful Old Man of the Sea told me,[141] I will tell you all without concealment, and hold back nothing.[142] He said he had seen him on an island, suffering strong pains[143] in the palace of the nymph Kalypso, and she detains him,[144] by constraint, and he cannot make his way to his country;[145] for he has not any ships by him, nor any companions[146] who can convey him back across the sea’s wide ridges.’[147] So spoke Atreus’ son, spear-famed Menelaos. After[148] I had done all this I came back. The immortals gave me a following[149] wind, and brought me quickly to the dear land of my fathers.”[150] So he spoke, and stirred the spirit within her. And now[151] Theoklymenos, a godlike man, spoke to both of them:[152] “O respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,[153] attend my word, because he does not understand clearly,[154] but I shall prophesy truly to you, and hold back nothing.[155] Zeus be my witness, first of the gods, and the table of friendship,[156] and the hearth of blameless Odysseus, to which I come as a suppliant,[157] that Odysseus is already here in the land of his fathers,[158] sitting still or advancing, learning of all these evil[159] actions, and devising evils for all of the suitors.[160] Such was the bird sign I interpreted, and I told it[161] to Telemachos, as I sat aboard the strong-benched vessel.”[162] Then in turn circumspect Penelope answered him:[163] “If only this word, stranger and guest, were brought to fulfillment,[164] soon you would be aware of my love and many gifts given[165] by me, so any man who met you would call you blessed.”[166] So now these three were conversing thus with each other,[167] but meanwhile before the palace of Odysseus the suitors[168] amused themselves with discs and with light spears for throwing,[169] on a leveled floor, unruly men, as they always had been.[170] But when it was time for dinner, and the sheep from the fields had been coming[171] in from all sides, and the same men as usual drove them,[172] then Medon spoke to the suitors. It was he among all the heralds[173] whom they liked best, and he used to wait on them at their feasting:[174] “Young men, since you have all taken your pleasure in exercise,  p 470  [175] go on into the house so we can make dinner ready.[176] Nothing is any the worse when meals are taken in season.”[177] He spoke, and they stood up and went, and did as he told them;[178] and they, when they had gone into the well-settled palace,[179] laid their mantles down along the chairs and the benches,[180] and set about sacrificing great-sized sheep, and fat goats,[181] and sacrificing an ox of the herd, and fattened porkers,[182] as they prepared their feast. But Odysseus now and the noble[183] swineherd were stirring themselves to go to town from the country.[184] First of the two to speak was the swineherd, leader of people:[185] “Stranger, since then you are eager to go to the city[186] today, as my master told you to do, though I could have wanted[187] you rather to stay here and guard the steading—even so[188] I go in awe of him and fear him, and any reproaches[189] he might give me; a scolding comes hard from a master—so then,[190] let us be on our way, for most of the day is already[191] gone. The evening is coming on. You may find it colder.”[192] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[193] “I see, I understand. You speak to one who follows you.[194] But let us be on our way. You be my guide on the journey.[195] Only give me some kind of cudgel, if you have any[196] cut, to lean on. They say the road is very slippery.”[197] He spoke, and over his shoulder slung the ugly wallet[198] that was full of holes, with a twist of rope attached to dangle it.[199] Eumaios gave him a walking stick that suited his fancy,[200] and the two of them went on, with the dogs and the herdsman staying[201] behind to guard the farm. He led his lord to the city,[202] looking as he did like a dismal vagabond and an old man,[203] propping on a stick, and wore wretched clothing upon his body.[204] Now as they went down over the stony road, and were coming[205] close to the city, and had arrived at the fountain, sweet-running[206] and made of stone; and there the townspeople went for their water;[207] Ithakos had made this, and Neritos, and Polyktor;[208] and around it was a grove of black poplars, trees that grow by[209] water, all in a circle, and there was cold water pouring[210] down from the rock above; over it had been built an altar[211] of the nymphs, and there all the wayfarers made their sacrifice;[212] there Melanthios, son of Dolios, came upon them[213] as he drove his goats, the ones that were finest among his goatflocks,[214] for the suitors’ dinner, and two other herdsmen went along with him.[215] Seeing the two he spoke and named them, giving them curses[216] overbearing and shameful, and stirred the heart of Odysseus:[217] “See now how the rascal comes on leading a rascal[218] about; like guides what is like itself, just as a god does.[219] Where, you detestable swineherd, are you taking this wretched[220] man, this bothersome beggar who spoils the fun of the feasting,[221] the kind who stands and rubs his shoulders on many doorposts,[222] begging only for handouts, never for swords or caldrons.[223] If you would turn him over to me to keep my steading,[224] then he could drink whey and build up a big leg muscle,[225] sweeping my pens, and carrying green stuff in to the young goats.[226] But since he has learned nothing but mischief, he will not be willing[227] to go to work, but would rather go begging all through the district,  p 471  [228] asking for handouts and feeding up his bottomless belly.[229] But I tell you this straight out and it will be a thing accomplished.[230] If he ever comes near the house of godlike Odysseus,[231] his ribs and head will feel the weight of plenty of footstools[232] flung at him all over the house by the hands of heroes.”[233] So he spoke, and as he went by recklessly lashed out[234] with his heel to the hip, but failed to knock him out of the pathway,[235] for Odysseus stood it, unshaken, while he pondered within him[236] whether to go for him with his cudgel, and take the life from him,[237] or pick him up like a jug and break his head on the ground. Yet[238] still he stood it, and kept it all inside him. The swineherd[239] stared, and cursed him, and prayed aloud with his hands uplifted:[240] “Nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus, if ever Odysseus[241] burned for you the thigh pieces of lambs or goats, wrapping them[242] in the rich fat, then grant me this favor I ask for, namely[243] that the man himself will come home, with the divinity guiding him;[244] so, Melanthios, he would send flying all those glories[245] you wear now in your insolence, forever loitering[246] here in the town, while useless herdsmen ruin the sheepflocks.”[247] Then in turn Melanthios the goatherd answered him:[248] “Shame on the speaking of this nasty-minded dog. Some day[249] I will get him aboard a strong-benched ship, and take him[250] far from Ithaka, where he could win me a good livelihood.[251] If only Apollo, silver-bowed, would strike down Telemachos[252] today in his halls, or he were killed by the suitors, as surely[253] as Odysseus, far away, has lost his day of homecoming.”[254] So he spoke, and left them there, as they went on easily;[255] but he went forward, and quickly came to the house of his master.[256] He went straight on inside, and sat down next to the suitors,[257] opposite Eurymachos, whom he was fondest of. The servants[258] doing the dinner placed a portion of meat before him.[259] A grave housekeeper brought the bread and set it down for him[260] to eat. Odysseus, on his way with the noble swineherd,[261] stood close in front of the house, and around them came the clamor[262] of the hollow lyre, for Phemios had struck up the music[263] to sing. Odysseus took the swineherd’s hand, and said to him:[264] “Eumaios, surely this is the handsome house of Odysseus.[265] Easily it is singled out and seen among many,[266] for one part is joined on to another, and the courtyard is worked on[267] with wall and copings, and the doors have been well made, with double[268] panels. Nobody could belittle this house. And also[269] I realize that many men are holding a feast there,[270] for the smell of the food comes to me, and there is the clamor[271] of the lyre, which the gods made to be companion of feasting.”[272] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[273] “Easily you perceived it, nor are you otherwise without[274] sense; but come, let us think out how we will act in these matters.[275] Either you go on first into the well-settled palace,[276] and go among the suitors, and leave me here on the outside;[277] or if you will, stay here, while I go on ahead of you.[278] But do not be slow, or someone here outside, seeing you,[279] might strike you, or throw something. Here, I bid you be careful.”[280] Then much-enduring great Odysseus said to him in answer:  p 472  [281] “I see, I understand; you speak to one who follows you.[282] But you go on ahead, and I will stay here on the outside.[283] I am not unfamiliar with blows, and things thrown at me.[284] The spirit in me is enduring, since I have suffered much hardship[285] on the waves and in the fighting; so let this adventure follow.[286] Even so, there is no suppressing the ravenous belly,[287] a cursed thing, which bestows many evils on men, seeing[288] that even for its sake the strong-built ships are handled[289] across the barren great sea, bringing misfortune to enemies.”[290] Now as these two were conversing thus with each other,[291] a dog who was lying there raised his head and ears. This was[292] Argos, patient-hearted Odysseus’ dog, whom he himself[293] raised, but got no joy of him, since before that he went to sacred[294] Ilion. In the days before, the young men had taken him[295] out to follow goats of the wild, and deer, and rabbits;[296] but now he had been put aside, with his master absent,[297] and lay on the deep pile of dung, from the mules and oxen,[298] which lay abundant before the gates, so that the servants[299] of Odysseus could take it to his great estate, for manuring.[300] There the dog Argos lay in the dung, all covered with dog ticks.[301] Now, as he perceived that Odysseus had come close to him,[302] he wagged his tail, and laid both his ears back; only[303] he now no longer had the strength to move any closer[304] to his master, who, watching him from a distance, without Eumaios[305] noticing, secretly wiped a tear away, and said to him:[306] “Eumaios, this is amazing, this dog that lies on the dunghill.[307] The shape of him is splendid, and yet I cannot be certain[308] whether he had the running speed to go with this beauty,[309] or is just one of the kind of table dog that gentlemen[310] keep, and it is only for show that their masters care for them.”[311] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[312] “This, it is too true, is the dog of a man who perished[313] far away. If he were such, in build and performance,[314] as when Odysseus left him behind, when he went to Ilion,[315] soon you could see his speed and his strength for yourself. Never[316] could any wild animal, in the profound depths of the forest,[317] escape, once he pursued. He was very clever at tracking.[318] But now he is in bad times. His master, far from his country,[319] has perished, and the women are careless, and do not look after him;[320] and serving men, when their masters are no longer about, to make them[321] work, are no longer willing to do their rightful duties.[322] For Zeus of the wide brows takes away one half of the virtue[323] from a man, once the day of slavery closes upon him.”[324] So he spoke, and went into the strongly-settled palace,[325] and strode straight on, to the great hall and the haughty suitors.[326] But the doom of dark death now closed over the dog, Argos,[327] when, after nineteen years had gone by, he had seen Odysseus.[328] Godlike Telemachos was the first by far to notice[329] the swineherd as he came into the house, and quickly he nodded[330] to summon him over. The swineherd, looking about him, picked up[331] a chair that was lying near where the carver sat, cutting[332] much meat for the suitors, as these feasted all through the palace.[333] This he took and placed it by Telemachos’ table  p 473  [334] facing him, then sat down there himself, and the herald[335] took a portion, and served him, and passed him bread from the basket.[336] Close after him Odysseus now came into the palace,[337] looking as he did like a dismal vagabond and an old man,[338] propping on a stick, and wore foul clothing upon his body.[339] He sat down then on the ashwood threshold, inside the doorway,[340] leaning against the doorpost of cypress wood, which the carpenter[341] once had expertly planed, and drawn it true to a chalkline;[342] but Telemachos spoke a word to the swineherd, calling him over,[343] taking and giving him a whole loaf from the beautiful basket,[344] with meat, as much food as both arms could hold in their compass:[345] “Take all this and give it to the stranger, but also tell him[346] to go about among the suitors, and beg from all of them.[347] Modesty, for a man in need, is not a good quality.”[348] So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he heard his order.[349] He came and stood close by Odysseus, and spoke in winged words:[350] “Stranger, Telemachos gives you this, and also he tells you[351] to go about among the suitors, and beg from all of them.[352] He said that modesty, for a poor man, is no good quality.”[353] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[354] “Lord Zeus, let Telemachos be one of the prosperous[355] men; let everything befall him that his heart longs for.”[356] He spoke, and with both hands accepting everything, laid it[357] there in front of his feet, on top of the ugly wallet,[358] and ate it, all the while the singer sang in the halls. Then,[359] when he had eaten his dinner, and the divine singer was finished,[360] the suitors raised their tumult along the halls; but Athene[361] came then and stood close by Odysseus, son of Laertes,[362] and stirred him to go collect his bits of bread from the suitors,[363] and so learn which of them were fair, which unfair; but even[364] so, she would not deliver any of them from disaster.[365] He went on his way, from left to right, so to beg from each man,[366] reaching his hand out always, as if for a long time he had been[367] a beggar, and they took pity and gave, and they wondered at him;[368] they asked each other what man he was, and where he came from.[369] But now Melanthios, the goat-herding man, said to them:[370] “Hear me now, you suitors of our glorious queen, concerning[371] this stranger; for I have seen him before; know then[372] that it was the swineherd who guided him here, but I do not know clearly[373] who the man is himself, or what race he claims to come of.”[374] So he spoke. Antinoös spoke then and scolded the swineherd:[375] “O most distinguished swineherd, why did you bring this fellow[376] to the city? Do we not already have enough other[377] vagabonds, and bothersome beggars to ruin our feasting?[378] Or, now that men gather here to eat up your master’s substance,[379] is that not enough, but you had to invite this one in also?”[380] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to him in answer:[381] “Antinoös, though you are noble, this was not well spoken.[382] For who goes visiting elsewhere so as to call in another[383] stranger, unless he is one who works for the people, either[384] a prophet, or a healer of sickness, or a skilled workman,[385] or inspired singer, one who can give delight by his singing?[386] These are the men who all over the endless earth are invited.  p 474  [387] But nobody would ask in a beggar, one who would feed on[388] himself. You, though, beyond all the other suitors, are heavy[389] on the servants of Odysseus, and me most of all, but I[390] for my part do not care, while still circumspect Penelope[391] lives in the palace, together with godlike Telemachos.”[392] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[393] “Silence. Do not answer him at such length. Antinoös[394] has made it his habit always to irritate others with hurtful[395] words, and stir them up, and encourages others to do so.”[396] So he spoke, and then addressed his words to Antinoös:[397] “Antinoös, as a father for his son you take good care[398] of me, when you tell our stranger guest to get out of the palace,[399] with a strict word. May this not be the end god makes of it.[400] Take and give. I do not begrudge you. I even urge you.[401] And do not have any respect for my mother, nor yet for any[402] thrall beside, who lives in the house of godlike Odysseus.[403] But such is not the kind of intention you keep within you.[404] You are more eager to eat, yourself, than to give to another.”[405] Then in turn Antinoös said to him in answer:[406] “High-spoken intemperate Telemachos, what accusations[407] you have made. If all the suitors would hand him this kind of present,[408] the house would then do without him for the space of three months.”[409] So he spoke, and picked up a footstool that lay by the table[410] and showed it. He had his shining feet on it as he feasted.[411] But all the others gave to him, and they filled his wallet[412] with bread and meat, and Odysseus was on the point of finishing[413] his test of the Achaians, and getting back free to his doorsill;[414] but now he stood by Antinoös, and spoke a word to him:[415] “Give, dear friend. You seem to me, of all the Achaians,[416] not the worst, but the best. You look like a king. Therefore,[417] you ought to give me a better present of food than the others[418] have done, and I will sing your fame all over the endless[419] earth, for I too once lived in my own house among people,[420] prospering in wealth, and often I gave to a wanderer[421] according to what he was and wanted when he came to me;[422] and I had serving men by thousands, and many another[423] good thing, by which men live well and are called prosperous. Only[424] Zeus, son of Kronos, spoiled it all—somehow he wished to—[425] when he put into my head to go with the roving pirates[426] to Egypt, a long voyage, so that I must be ruined.[427] I stayed my oarswept ships inside the Aigyptos River.[428] Then I urged my eager companions to stay where they were, there[429] close to the fleet, and to guard the ships, and was urgent with them[430] to send lookouts to the watching places, but they following[431] their own impulse, and giving way to marauding violence,[432] suddenly began plundering the Egyptians’ beautiful[433] fields, and carried off the women and innocent children,[434] and killed the men, and soon the outcry came to the city.[435] They heard the shouting, and at the time when dawn shows, they came[436] on us, and all the plain was filled with horses and infantry[437] and the glare of bronze; and Zeus who delights in the thunder flung down[438] a foul panic among my companions, and none was so hardy  p 475  [439] as to stand and fight, for the evils stood in a circle around them.[440] There they killed many of us with the sharp bronze, and others[441] they led away alive, to work for them in forced labor;[442] but they gave me away, into Cyprus, to a stranger arriving,[443] Dmetor, Iasos’ son, who was the strong king in Cyprus.[444] From there I came here, where I am now, suffering hardships.”[445] Then Antinoös answered him in turn, and said to him:[446] “What spirit brought this pain upon us, to spoil our feasting?[447] Stand off, so, in the middle, and keep away from my table,[448] or otherwise you may find yourself in a sorry Cyprus[449] or Egypt, you are so bold a one, and a shameless beggar.[450] You went the whole circle and stood by all, and they all gave to you[451] recklessly, for there is no holding back nor sparing[452] of favors from another man’s goods, since each has plenty.”[453] Now resourceful Odysseus spoke, as he drew back from him:[454] “Shame; the wits in you, it is clear, do not match your outward[455] beauty. You would not give a bit of salt to a servant[456] in your own house, since now, sitting at another’s, you could not[457] take a bit of bread and give it to me. It is there in abundance.”[458] He spoke, and Antinoös in his heart grew still more angry.[459] Looking at him from under his brows, he addresses him in winged words:[460] “Now I think that you can no longer make a respectable[461] retreat out of the palace, since what you say is scurrilous.”[462] He spoke, and threw the footstool an hit him in the right shoulder[463] near the base, in the back, but he stood up to it, steady[464] as a rock, nor did the missile thrown by Antinoös shake him,[465] but he shook his head in silence, deeply devising evils.[466] He went back to the sill and sat there, and spread out before him[467] the wallet that was well filled, and spoke a word to the suitors:[468] “You who are suitors of this most glorious queen, hear me[469] while I speak out what the heart within my breast urges:[470] there is no grief that comes to the heart, nor yet any sorrow,[471] when a man is hit, fighting in battle for the sake of his own[472] possessions, either to guard his shining sheep or his cattle;[473] but Antinoös struck me all because of my wretched belly,[474] that cursed thing, who bestows many evils on men. Therefore,[475] if there are any gods or any furies for beggars,[476] Antinoös may find his death before he is married.”[477] Then Antinoös, son of Eupeithes, gave him an answer:[478] “Go in peace, stranger, and sit down, or go away elsewhere,[479] or else, for the way you talk, the young men might take you and drag you[480] by hand or foot through the house, and tear the skin on your body.”[481] So he spoke, but all the rest were wildly indignant,[482] and this is the way one of these haughty young men would speak to him:[483] “Antinoös, you did badly to hit the unhappy vagabond:[484] a curse on you, if he turns out to be some god from heaven.[485] For the gods do take on all sorts of transformations, appearing[486] as strangers from elsewhere, and thus they range at large through the cities,[487] watching to see which men keep the laws, and which are violent.”[488] So spoke the suitors, but he paid no attention to what they were saying.[489] But Telemachos sustained in his heart a great sorrow over[490] the blow, but he did not let fall from his eyes any groundward  p 476  [491] tear, but shook his head in silence, deeply devising[492] evils. But when circumspect Penelope heard that the stranger[493] had been struck in her halls, she spoke to her serving women:[494] “Thus, I pray, may the archer Apollo strike at the striker.”[495] Then the housekeeper, Eurynome, spoke and answered:[496] “If only some fullfilment befell our prayers. Then not one[497] of these men would be alive to meet the Dawn in her splendor.”[498] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[499] “Mother, they are all hateful, since all are devising evils,[500] but Antinoös, beyond the rest, is like black death. Here is[501] a stranger, some unfortunate man, who goes through our palace[502] asking alms of the men, for his helplessness forces him to it.[503] Then all the others gave and filled his bag, but this man[504] struck him with a footstool at the base of the right shoulder.”[505] So Penelope, sitting up in her chamber, conversed[506] with her serving women, while great Odysseus was eating his dinner.[507] But now she summoned the noble swineherd to her, saying:[508] “Go on your way now, noble Eumaios, and tell the stranger[509] to come, so I can befriend him, and so I can ask him[510] if he has somewhere heard any news of steadfast Odysseus[511] or seen him in person. He seems like a man who has wandered widely.”[512] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to her in answer:[513] “If only these Achaians, my queen, would let you have silence![514] Such stories he tells, he would charm out the dear heart within you.[515] Three nights I had him with me, and for three days I detained him[516] in my shelter, for he came first to me. He had fled from a vessel;[517] but he has not yet told the story of all his suffering.[518] But as when a man looks to a singer, who has been given[519] from the gods the skill with which he sings for delight of mortals,[520] and they are impassioned and strain to hear it when he sings to them,[521] so he enchanted me in the halls as he sat beside me.[522] He says that he is a friend by family of Odysseus,[523] with his home in Crete, where lives the generation of Minos,[524] and from there he made his way to this place, suffering hardships,[525] driven helpless along. He claims he has heard that Odysseus[526] is near, in the rich country of the men of Thesprotia,[527] and alive, and bringing many treasures back to his household.”[528] Then in turn circumspect Penelope said to him:[529] “Go now, call him here, so he can tell me directly,[530] and let these people sit by the doors and play their games, or else[531] go and do it at home, whenever the spirit favors.[532] For their own properties are stored, unspoiled, in their houses,[533] bread, and sweet wine, but this their own house-people eat. Meanwhile,[534] they, day by day visiting our house, and always[535] dedicating our oxen, and our sheep and fat goats,[536] hold their festival and recklessly drink up our shining[537] wine; and most of it is used up, for there is no man here[538] such as Odysseus was, to keep the plague from his household.[539] But if Odysseus could come home, and return to the land of his fathers,[540] soon, with his son, he could punish the violence of these people.”[541] She spoke, and Telemachos sneezed amain, and around him the palace[542] re-echoed terribly to the sound. Penelope, laughing,  p 477  [543] spoke presently to Eumaios and addressed him in winged words:[544] “Go, please, and summon the stranger into my presence. Do you[545] not see how my son sneezed for everything I have spoken?[546] May it mean that death, accomplished in full, befall the suitors[547] each and all, not one avoiding death and destruction.[548] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[549] If I learn that everything he says is truthfully spoken,[550] I will give him beautiful clothing to wear, a tunic and mantle.”[551] So she spoke, and the swineherd went, when he heard what she told him,[552] and he came and stood close by Odysseus and spoke in winged words:[553] “Father and friend, circumspect Penelope, mother[554] of Telemachos, summons you, for her heart is urgent to find out[555] from you about her husband, though she is suffering troubles.[556] And if she learns that all you say is truthfully spoken,[557] she will give you a tunic and mantle to wear, what you have need of[558] most of all; and you, by begging your bread through the city,[559] can keep your belly sustained; and he who will can give to you.”[560] Then in turn much-enduring great Odysseus answered him:[561] “Eumaios, by and by I will tell everything truly[562] to the daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope.[563] For I know well about him, we have suffered the same sad story.[564] Only now I am afraid of this swarm of rough suitors,[565] whose outrageous violence goes up into the iron[566] sky. For even now, as I went through the house, doing[567] no harm, and this man struck me and gave me over to suffering,[568] Telemachos could not save me from this, nor could any other.[569] Tell Penelope, therefore, for all her eagerness, to wait[570] for me in the palace until the sun has set. Let her[571] then question me about her husband’s day of homecoming,[572] giving me a seat close to the fire, since these are wretched[573] clothes I have. You know this yourself; you are my first patron.”[574] So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he heard what he told him.[575] But Penelope said to him as he stepped over the threshold:[576] “You do not bring him, Eumaios? What is this vagabond thinking?[577] Does he fear some indignity, or is he otherwise bashful[578] about the house? A bashful vagabond makes a bad beggar.”[579] Then, O swineherd Eumaios, you said to her in answer:[580] “He speaks within reason, as another man might think also,[581] in keeping away from the violence of these insolent men. Therefore[582] he tells you to wait until after the sun has gone down. For you[583] yourself also, my queen, this way it will be much better:[584] to talk in private to the stranger, and hear his story.”[585] Then in turn circumspect Penelope answered him:[586] “So it shall be. The stranger’s thought is not without good sense,[587] since never yet among mortal mankind have there been any[588] men who have been so violent in their wild endeavors.”[589] So she instructed him, and the noble swineherd went back[590] into the crowd of the suitors, when he had understood all of it.[591] At once he spoke his winged words to Telemachos, leaning[592] his head close to him, so that none of the others might hear him:[593] “Dear child, I am going back to guard the pigs and that other[594] livelihood that is yours and mine. Let all be in your charge  p 478  [595] here. First of all take care of yourself, and be very watchful[596] against harm to you. There are many Achaians who wish you evil.[597] May Zeus destroy them before they can make any harm befall us.”[598] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[599] “So it shall be, my father. Go, when you have had your supper;[600] but come again in the morning, and bring us beautiful victims.[601] I myself will see to things here, as will the immortals.”[602] So he spoke, and the other sat down again on a polished[603] chair. But when he had had his fill of eating and drinking,[604] he went on back to the pigs, and left the courts and the palace[605] full of banqueters, who took their pleasure in singing[606] and dancing. By now the later part of the day had come on.book eighteen[1] And now there arrived a public beggar, who used to go begging[2] through the town of Ithaka, known to fame for his ravenous belly[3] and appetite for eating and drinking. There was no real strength[4] in him, nor any force, but his build was big to look at.[5] He had the name Arnaios, for thus the lady his mother[6] called him from birth, but all the young men used to call him Iros,[7] because he would run and give messages when anyone told him.[8] This man had come to chase Odysseus out of his own house[9] and now he spoke, insulting him, and addressed him in winged words:[10] “Give way, old sir, from the forecourt, before you are taken and dragged out[11] by the foot. Do you see how all of them are giving the signal[12] and telling me to drag you. Still, I am ashamed to do it.[13] So up, before it comes to a battle of hands between us.”[14] Then looking at him darkly resourceful Odysseus answered:[15] “Strange man, I am doing you no harm, nor speaking any,[16] nor am I jealous, if someone takes plenty and gives it to you.[17] This doorsill is big enough for both of us, nor have you any[18] need to be jealous of others. I think you are a vagabond[19] as I am too. Prosperity is in the gods’ giving.[20] Leave blows alone, do not press me too hard, or you may make me[21] angry so that, old as I am, I may give you a bloody[22] chest and mouth. Then I could have peace, and still more of it[23] tomorrow, for I do not think you will make your way back here[24] a second time to the house of Odysseus, son of Laertes.”[25] Then in anger Iros the vagabond said to him:[26] “Shame on how the old hulk rolls along in his speech, like[27] an old woman at the oven. I have some bad plans for him:[28] hit him with both hands, and spatter all of the teeth out[29] from his jaws on the ground, as if he were a wild pig rooting[30] the crops. Come, tuck up, so all these people can see us[31] do battle. But how can you fight against a man who is younger?”[32] So, in front of the towering doors, and upon the threshold[33] polished smooth, these two hurled jagged words at each other;[34] and Antinoös, the sacred prince, stirred them on to battle,[35] and laughing sweetly he spoke aloud to the rest of the suitors:[36] “Friends, in the past nothing has ever happened to match  p 479  [37] this entertainment that the god has now brought to the palace;[38] for the stranger and Iros are now making ready for battle[39] with their fists. Come, let the rest of us speed the encounter.”[40] So he spoke, and the rest of them all sprang up, laughing,[41] and gathered all in a group around the two ragged beggars.[42] It was Antinoös the son of Eupeithes who spoke to them:[43] “Listen to me, you haughty suitors, while I say something.[44] Here are some goat paunches set on the fire; we filled them[45] with blood and fat, and set them there, to eat after supper.[46] Whichever of these men wins the contest, and is proved better,[47] let him come up, and help himself to whichever he likes best;[48] and he shall always have dinner with us, nor shall we ever[49] admit any other beggar to join us inside, and beg from us.”[50] So Antinoös spoke, and what he had said was pleasing.[51] But now resourceful Odysseus, with crafty thoughts, said to him:[52] “Friends, it is not possible for a man who is older[53] and worn with sorrow to fight with a younger man, but my villainous[54] belly drives me to do it, and fall to his fists. Therefore,[55] come, swear me a strong oath all of you, that no one[56] will take the side of Iros and lightheartedly strike me[57] down with a heavy hand, and make me fall to his onset.”[58] So he spoke, and they all swore him the oath as he asked it.[59] But when all had sworn the oath and made an end of their swearing,[60] the hallowed prince Telemachos now spoke out among them:[61] “Stranger, if your heart and spirit are urgent with you[62] to defend yourself against this man, then fear no other[63] Achaian. The man who strikes you shall have to fight against numbers.[64] I myself am your host, with the assent of the two kings[65] Antinoös and Eurymachos, both men of prudence.”[66] So he spoke, and they all applauded him. But Odysseus[67] girded up his rags about his body, displaying[68] his thighs, splendid and large, and one could see the wide shoulders;[69] his chest showed, and his ponderous arms; and also Athene[70] standing close beside the shepherd of the people magnified[71] his limbs, and the suitors all in their insolence were astonished,[72] and thus would one of them speak, looking over at his next neighbor:[73] “Iros will soon be Iros no more, with himself to thank for[74] the evil. See what limbs the old man’s rags have uncovered.”[75] So he spoke, and the heart in Iros was stirred with trouble,[76] but even so the thralls girt him forcibly up, and dragged him[77] there. He was frightened, and the flesh shook all over his body.[78] Antinoös scolded him with a word and spoke out and named him:[79] “I do not care if you live or die, you great ox, nor what happens[80] to you, when you are afraid of this man, and tremble before him,[81] an old man, and worn with the sorrows that have come upon him.[82] But I tell you this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished.[83] If this man wins the fight with you, and is proved the better,[84] I will throw you into a black ship, and send you across to the mainland,[85] to Echetos, who preys on all men, and who is king there,[86] and he with the pitiless bronze will cut off your nose and ears,[87] and tear off your privates and give them raw for the dogs to feed on.”[88] So he spoke, and the trembling even more took hold of  p 480  [89] his limbs, but they pulled him on, and both men put their hands up.[90] At that time, much-enduring great Odysseus pondered[91] whether to hit him so that the life would go out of him, as he[92] went down, or only to stretch him out by hitting him lightly.[93] And in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[94] to hit him lightly, so the Achaians would not be suspicious.[95] They put up their hands, and Iros hit him on the right shoulder,[96] but Odysseus struck the neck underneath the ear, and shattered[97] the bones within, and the red blood came in his mouth, filling it.[98] He dropped, bleating, in the dust, with teeth set in a grimace,[99] and kicking at the ground with his feet, and the haughty suitors[100] held up their hands and died with laughing. Meanwhile, Odysseus[101] dragged him by the foot through the porch, till he came to the courtyard[102] and the portico doors, and propped him against the courtyard[103] wall, sitting up, and stuck the staff in his hand, to hold it.[104] Then he spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words:[105] “Sit there now, and scare away the dogs and the stray pigs.[106] But you must no longer try to be king of the strangers and beggars,[107] being such a wretch, or you may win yourself still more evil.”[108] He spoke, and threw across his shoulders his ugly wallet[109] that was full of holes, with a twist of rope attached to dangle it.[110] He went back to the sill again and sat down, but the others[111] went inside again, laughing sweetly, and drank to him, saying:[112] “May Zeus, stranger, and all the other immortals give you[113] what you want most of all and what is dear to your spirit,[114] for having stopped the wandering of this greedy creature[115] in our neighborhood. Soon we will take him across to the mainland,[116] to Echetos, who preys on all men, and who is king there.”[117] So they spoke, and great Odysseus was pleased at the omen.[118] Now Antinoös set before him the great paunch pudding[119] that was all filled with fat and blood. Amphinomos, taking[120] two loaves of bread out of the basket, set them before him,[121] and drank his health in a golden cup and spoke to him, saying:[122] “Your health, father and stranger; may prosperous days befall you[123] hereafter; but now you are held in the grip of many misfortunes.”[124] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[125] “Amphinomos, you seem to me very prudent, being[126] the son of such a father, whose excellent fame I have heard of,[127] Nisos, that is, of Doulichion, both strong and prosperous;[128] they say you are his son, and you seem like a man well-spoken.[129] So I will tell you, and you in turn understand and listen.[130] Of all creatures that breathe and walk on the earth there is nothing[131] more helpless than a man is, of all that the earth fosters;[132] for he thinks that he will never suffer misfortune in future[133] days, while the gods grant him courage, and his knees have spring[134] in them. But when the blessed gods bring sad days upon him,[135] against his will he must suffer it with enduring spirit.[136] For the mind in men upon earth goes according to the fortunes[137] the Father of Gods and Men, day by day, bestows upon them.[138] For I myself once promised to be a man of prosperity,[139] but, giving way to force and violence, did many reckless[140] things, because I relied on my father and brothers. Therefore,  p 481  [141] let no man be altogether without the sense of righteousness,[142] but take in silence the gifts of the gods, whatever they give him.[143] Even so, now, I see the suitors, their reckless devisings,[144] how they show no respect to the wife, and despoil the possessions[145] of a man who, I think, will not for long be far from[146] his country and friends. He is very close by. But I hope your destiny[147] takes you home, out of his way. I hope you never will face him,[148] at the time he comes back to the beloved land of his fathers.[149] For I believe that, once he enters his halls, there will be[150] a reckoning, not without blood, between that man and the suitors.”[151] So he spoke, and poured, and drank the honey-sweet wine, then[152] put the cup back into the hands of the lord of the people;[153] but the other went back across the room, heart saddened within him,[154] shaking his head, for in his spirit he saw the evil,[155] but still could not escape his doom, for Athene had bound him[156] fast, to be strongly killed by the hands and spear of Telemachos.[157] He went back and sat down on the chair from which he had risen.[158] But now the goddess, gray-eyed Athene, put it in the mind[159] of the daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[160] to show herself to the suitors, so that she might all the more[161] open their hearts, and so that she might seem all the more precious[162] in the eyes of her husband and son even than she had been before this.[163] She laughed, in an idle way, and spoke to her nurse and named her:[164] “Eurynome, my heart desires, though before it did not,[165] to show myself to the suitors, although I still hate them. Also,[166] I would speak a word to my son, and that would be for the better,[167] that he should not always go among the insolent suitors,[168] who speak him well, but are plotting evil things for the future.”[169] Eurynome the housekeeper said to her in answer:[170] “Now all this you have said, my child, was fair and orderly.[171] Go then, and speak a word to your son, hide nothing. Only[172] first you should wash your body and anoint your face. Do not[173] go down with a face so ravaged all over by tears, as it now is,[174] since nothing is gained by indiscriminate sorrowing always.[175] For now your son is come of age, and you know you always[176] prayed the immortals, beyond all else, to see him bearded.”[177] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[178] “Eurynome, though you care for me, do not speak of such matters[179] as washing my body and anointing myself with unguents,[180] seeing that the gods, they who possess Olympos, ruined[181] my glory, from that time when he went away in the hollow[182] ships. But tell Autonoe and Hippodameia[183] to come, so that they can stand at my side in the great hall.[184] I will not go alone among men. I think that immodest.”[185] So she spoke, and the old woman went away through the palace,[186] and brought the word to the women, and urged them to go to their mistress.[187] Then the goddess gray-eyed Athene thought what to do next.[188] She drifted a sweet sleep over Ikarios’ daughter,[189] and all her joints were relaxed so that she slumbered, reclining[190] there on the couch. Meanwhile she, shining among goddesses,[191] endowed her with gifts immortal, to make the Achaians admire her.[192] First, for her beauty’s sake, she freshened all her fine features  p 482  [193] with ambrosia, such as fair-garlanded Kythereia uses[194] for salve, whenever she joins the lovely dance of the Graces.[195] She made her taller for the eye to behold, and thicker,[196] and she made her whiter than sawn ivory. After so doing,[197] she, Athene, shining among goddesses, departed,[198] and the white-armed handmaidens came running in from the great hall,[199] with clamor, about Penelope, and the sweet sleep released her.[200] She rubbed her cheeks with both her hands and spoke aloud, saying:[201] “That was a strange thing, that soft sleep that shrouded me.[202] How I wish chaste Artemis would give me a death so[203] soft, and now, so I would not go on in my heart grieving[204] all my life, and longing for love of a husband excellent[205] in every virtue, since he stood out among the Achaians.”[206] So she spoke, and made her descent from her shining chamber,[207] not all alone, since two handmaidens went to attend her.[208] When she, shining among women, came near the suitors,[209] she stood by the pillar that supported the roof with its joinery,[210] holding her shining veil in front of her face, to shield it,[211] and a devoted attendant was stationed on either side of her.[212] Their knees gave way, and the hearts in them were bemused with passion,[213] and each one prayed for the privilege of lying beside her;[214] but she spoke rather to her beloved son, Telemachos:[215] “Telemachos, your mind and thoughts are no longer steadfast.[216] When you were a child still, you had better thoughts in mind. Now,[217] when you are big, and come to the measure of maturity, and one[218] who saw you, some outsider, viewing your size and beauty,[219] would say you were the son born of a prosperous man;[220] your thoughts are no longer righteous, nor your perception;[221] such a thing has been done now, here in our palace, and you[222] permitted our stranger guest to be so outrageously handled.[223] How much it be now, if the stranger who sits in our household[224] is to be made to suffer so from bitter brutality?[225] That must be your outrage and shame as people see it.”[226] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[227] “My mother, I cannot complain of your anger. I myself[228] notice all these things in my heart and know of them, better[229] and worse alike, but before now I was only an infant;[230] but still I cannot see my way to the wise course always,[231] for these men come from one place or another, and sit beside me[232] with their evil thoughts, and distract me, and there are none here to help me.[233] Yet it was not by the will of the suitors that this struggle took place[234] between Iros and the stranger, and he was stronger than Iros[235] in battle. O father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo,[236] if only in our house, in such a manner, the suitors[237] could be defeated and bow their heads, some in the courtyard[238] and some inside of the house, and the limbs be unstrung in each of them;[239] as now for Iros, as he sits over there by the courtyard[240] gates, lolling his head like a drunken man, and unable[241] to stand upright on his feet again and make his way homeward[242] to wherever he makes his home, since there is no strength in his body.”[243] So these two were conversing in this way with each other;[244] but Eurymachos now spoke out and addressed Penelope:  p 483  [245] “Daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[246] if only all the Achaians in Iad Argos could see you,[247] at dawn of day tomorrow there would be even more suitors[248] come to feast in your house, since you surpass all women[249] for beauty and stature and for the mind well balanced within you.”[250] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[251] “Eurymachos, all my excellence, my beauty and figure,[252] were ruined by the immortals at that time when the Argives took ship[253] for Ilion, and with them went my husband, Odysseus.[254] If he were to come back to me and take care of my life, then[255] my reputation would be more great and splendid. As it is[256] now, I grieve; such evils the god has let loose upon me.[257] When he went and left me behind in the land of his fathers,[258] he took me by the right hand at the wrist, and then said to me:[259] ‘Dear wife, since I do not think the strong-greaved Achaians[260] will all come safely home from Troy without hurt, seeing[261] that people say the Trojans are men who can fight in battle,[262] that they are throwers of the spear, and shooters of arrows,[263] and riders with fast-footed horses, who with the greatest[264] speed settle the great and hateful issue of common battle,[265] I do not know if the god will spare me, or if I must be lost[266] there in Troy; here let everything be in your charge.[267] You must take thought for my father and mother here in our palace,[268] as you do now, or even more, since I shall be absent.[269] But when you see our son grown up and bearded, then you may[270] marry whatever man you please, forsaking your household.’[271] So he spoke then; and now all this is being accomplished.[272] And there will come that night when a hateful marriage is given[273] to wretched me, for Zeus has taken my happiness from me.[274] But this thing comes as a bitter distress to my heart and spirit:[275] the behavior of these suitors is not as it was in time past[276] when suitors desired to pay their court to a noble woman[277] and daughter of a rich man, and rival each other. Such men[278] themselves bring in their own cattle and fat sheep, to feast[279] the family of the bride, and offer glorious presents.[280] They do not eat up another’s livelihood, without payment.”[281] She spoke, and much-enduring great Odysseus was happy[282] because she beguiled gifts out of them, and enchanted their spirits[283] with blandishing words, while her own mind had other intentions.[284] Then Antinoös the son of Eupeithes answered:[285] “Daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[286] whatever gift any Achaian wishes to bring here,[287] take it; it is not honorable to refuse the giving.[288] We will not go back to our own estates, nor will we go elsewhere,[289] until you marry whichever Achaian you fancy.”[290] So spoke Antinoös, and his word pleased the rest of them.[291] Each man sent his herald off to bring back the presents.[292] Antinoös’ herald brought in a great robe, beautiful[293] and elaborate, and in it were twelve double pins, golden[294] all through, and fitted with bars that opened and closed easily.[295] Eurymachos’ man came back with an elaborate necklace[296] of gold, strung with bits of amber, and bright as sunshine.  p 484  [297] Eurydamas’ servants came back bringing a pair of earrings[298] with triple drops in mulberry clusters, and there was radiant[299] charm in them. From the house of the lord Peisandros, Polyktor’s[300] son, his servant brought a necklace, a wonderful offering.[301] Each of the Achaians brought a different beautiful[302] present; and she, shining among women, went back to her upper[303] room, and her maidservants carried the beautiful presents for her.[304] But now the suitors, turning to the dance and delightful[305] song, took their pleasure and awaited the coming of evening,[306] and the black night came on as they were taking their pleasure.[307] Accordingly, they set up three cressets about the palace,[308] to give them light, and about them they laid piles of firewood[309] pieces, long dried and seasoned, but lately split with the brazen[310] ax; and put kindling in with it, and the maids of enduring[311] Odysseus were ready to take turns keeping them burning,[312] when illustrious resourceful Odysseus himself spoke to them:[313] “You maids of Odysseus, whose master has long been absent,[314] go back into the house where the respected queen is,[315] and in her presence turn your distaffs, and sit beside her[316] in the halls, and comfort her, or comb your wool in your hands there.[317] But I myself will provide the light for all of these people.[318] And even if they wish to keep at it until the high-throned[319] dawn, they will not wear me out. I am very enduring.”[320] So he spoke, and they burst out laughing and looked at each other;[321] but Melantho of the lovely face shamefully scolded him.[322] Dolios was her father, but Penelope had taken[323] her in, and cared for her like a daughter and cheered her with presents;[324] but even so her heart had no sorrow for Penelope,[325] but she used to sleep with Eurymachos, and she was his sweetheart.[326] Now she spoke to Odysseus and gave him a scolding:[327] “Wretched stranger, you must be one whose wits are distracted,[328] when you will not go where the smith is at work, and sleep there,[329] or to some public gathering place, but staying here speak out[330] boldly and at length among many men, and your spirit[331] knows no fear. The wine must have your brains; or else always[332] you are such a man in your mind, a babbler of nonsense.[333] Are you so brave because you beat the vagabond Iros?[334] Take care lest a better man than Iros stand up against you,[335] one who can pummel you about the head with his heavy[336] hands, beat you, draw blood, and chase you out of the palace.”[337] Then looking at her darkly resourceful Odysseus answered:[338] “I think I will go to Telemachos, you bitch, and tell him[339] how you are talking, so that he will cut you to pieces.”[340] Speaking in words like this he fluttered the women. They went[341] on their way back into the house, and the knees of each one[342] went loose with fear. They thought he was speaking the truth. He then[343] took his place by the burning cressets, and kept them lighted,[344] looking after them all himself, but the heart within him[345] was pondering other thoughts, which were not to go unaccomplished.[346] But Athene did not altogether permit the haughty[347] suitors to forgo their hard insolence, so that still more[348] grief would invade the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes.  p 485  [349] Eurymachos, son of Polybos, began speaking among them,[350] taunting Odysseus, and started up laughter among his companions:[351] “Hear me, all you suitors of the glorious queen, hear me[352] while I speak out what the heart within my breast urges.[353] This man comes as gift of the gods to the house of Odysseus.[354] It is my thought that he can give us illumination[355] from his bald head, which has no hair, not even a little.”[356] So he spoke, and addressed Odysseus, sacker of cities:[357] “Stranger, if I were to take you up, would you be willing[358] to work for me on my outer estate—I would give you adequate[359] pay—assembling stones for fences, and growing the tall trees?[360] There I would provide you with an allowance of victuals,[361] and give you shoes to wear on your feet, and clothing to put on.[362] But since all the work you have learned is bad, you will not be willing[363] to go off and work hard; no, you would rather beg where the people[364] are, and so be able to feed that ravenous belly.”[365] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[366] “Eurymachos, I wish there could be a working contest[367] between us, in the spring season when the days are lengthening,[368] out in the meadow, with myself holding a well-curved sickle,[369] and you one like it, so to test our endurance for labor,[370] without food, from dawn till dark, with plenty of grass for our mowing.[371] Or if it were oxen to be driven, those of the best sort,[372] large ones and ruddy, both well fed with grass, of an equal[373] age and carrying power, and their strength is not contemptible,[374] and there were four acres to plow, with the glebe giving to the plowshare.[375] There you would see if I could carve a continuous furrow.[376] Or again, if this day the son of Kronos should bring on[377] a battle, and I were given a great shield and two spears,[378] and a helmet all of bronze well fitted over my temples,[379] so you would see me taking my place as one of the foremost[380] fighters, and you could not speak so in scorn of my belly.[381] But now you are very insulting, and think to be short with me; also,[382] as I suppose, you think you are a tall man and powerful,[383] because you have dealings with few men and no brave ones; surely,[384] if Odysseus were to come back to the land of his fathers,[385] the gates of the house, although they are very wide, would suddenly[386] be too narrow as you took flight to escape from the forecourt.”[387] He spoke, and the anger mounted in the heart of Eurymachos,[388] and looking darkly at him he addressed him in winged words:[389] “Wretch, I will do you an injury for the way you are talking,[390] boldly and at length among many men, and your spirit[391] knows no fear. The wine must have your brains; or else always[392] you are such a man in your mind, a babbler of nonsense.[393] Are you so brave because you defeated the vagabond Iros?”[394] So he spoke, and caught up a footstool; but Odysseus[395] crouched against the knees of Doulichian Amphinomos[396] in fear of Eurymachos, who threw, and hit the cupbearer[397] in the right hand. The pitcher fell to the ground, clashing,[398] but the cupbearer fell on his back in the dust, groaning.[399] But the suitors all through the shadowy halls were raising a tumult,[400] and thus they would speak, each man looking at the man next him:  p 486  [401] “How I wish this stranger could have gone to perdition[402] somewhere else, before he came here; he has raised such a tumult,[403] and now we are fighting over beggars; there will be no pleasure[404] in the stately feast at all, since vile things will be uppermost.”[405] Now the hallowed prince Telemachos spoke a word to them:[406] “Fools, you are out of your minds and no longer conceal inside you[407] what you have eaten and drunk. It must be some god who troubles you.[408] You have feasted well; go to your homes and sleep, whenever,[409] that is, anyone desires to go home; I drive away no man.”[410] So he spoke, and all of them bit their lips in amazement[411] at Telemachos, and the daring way he had spoken to them.[412] Now they were addressed and spoken to by Amphinomos,[413] the glorious son of Nisos, son of the lord Aretios:[414] “Dear friends, no man must be angry, nor yet with violent[415] answers attack what has been spoken injustice. And do not[416] strike the stranger, as you have done, nor yet any other[417] serving man who is in the house of godlike Odysseus.[418] Come now, let the cupbearer pour wine in our goblets,[419] so we can pour a libation and then retire to our houses;[420] and in the halls of Odysseus we shall let Telemachos[421] look after the stranger, since it is his house that he came to.”[422] So he spoke, and the word he spoke was pleasing to all of them.[423] The hero Moulios, the Doulichian herald, mixed them[424] wine in the bowl. He was the henchman of Amphinomos.[425] He passed it around to all in order, and they, pouring[426] a libation to the blessed gods, drank the honey-sweet wine.[427] But when they had made libation and drunk as much as they wanted,[428] then they went home to go to bed, each man to his own house.book nineteen[1] Now great Odysseus still remained in the hall, pondering[2] how, with the help of Athene, he would murder the suitors.[3] Presently he spoke in winged words to Telemachos:[4] “Telemachos, we must have the weapons stored away inside[5] the high chamber; and when the suitors miss them and ask you[6] about them, answer and beguile them with soft words, saying:[7] ‘I stored them away out of the smoke, since they are no longer[8] like what Odysseus left behind when he went to Troy land,[9] but are made foul, with all the smoke of the fire upon them.[10] Also, some divinity put into my head this even[11] greater thought, that with the wine in you, you might stand up[12] and fight, and wound each other, and spoil the feast and the courting;[13] since iron all of itself works on a man and attracts him.’ ”[14] So he spoke, and Telemachos obeyed his dear father,[15] and summoned out Eurykleia his nurse, and said to her:[16] “Come, nurse, please detain the women inside the palace,[17] while I put away my father’s beautiful armor[18] in the inner room; it is carelessly laid in the house, and darkened[19] with smoke, in my father’s absence, and I was a child all that time.[20] Now I would put it away, where smoke from the fire will not reach it.”  p 487  [21] Then in turn Eurykleia his dear nurse said to him:[22] “I only hope, my child, that you will assume such foresight[23] in taking care of the house and protecting all our possessions.[24] But tell me, who is it will go with you and hold the light for you?[25] The maids would have given you light, but you would not let them come out.”[26] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[27] “This stranger will. I will not suffer a man who feeds from[28] our stores, and does not work, even though he comes from far off.”[29] So he spoke, and she had no winged words for an answer.[30] Eurykleia barred the doors of the strong-built great hall.[31] The two men, Odysseus and his glorious son, sprang up[32] and began carrying helmets, shields massive in the middle,[33] and pointed spears, and before them Pallas Athene, holding[34] a golden lamp, gave them splendid illumination.[35] Suddenly Telemachos spoke a word to his father:[36] “Father, here is a great wonder that my eyes look on.[37] Always it seems that the chamber walls, the handsome bases[38] and roof timbers of fit and tall columns sustaining them,[39] shine in my eyes as if a fire were blazing. There must be[40] surely a god here, one of those who hold the high heaven.”[41] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[42] “Hush, and keep it in your own mind, and do not ask questions.[43] For this is the very way of the gods, who hold Olympos.[44] You should now go to bed, and I shall remain behind here,[45] so that I can continue to stir up the maids, and also[46] your mother; and she in her sorrow will question me about everything.”[47] So he spoke, and Telemachos went out of the great hall[48] to his own chamber to go to bed, with torches to light him[49] to his bed, where he always lay when sweet sleep came on him.[50] There he lay this time also and waited for the divine Dawn,[51] while great Odysseus still remained in the hall, pondering[52] how, with the help of Athene, he would murder the suitors.[53] But now circumspect Penelope came down from her chamber,[54] looking like Artemis or like golden Aphrodite.[55] They set a chair for her to sit on close by the fireplace.[56] The chair was inlaid with ivory and silver; the craftsman[57] Ikmalios had made it, and for the feet he had joined on[58] a footstool, all of one piece with it; a great fleece was spread out[59] over the chair, and upon it circumspect Penelope[60] took her place. Her white-armed handmaidens came from the palace.[61] They cleared and carried away a great deal of food, with the tables[62] and goblets, where the men in high spirits had been drinking,[63] and shook the ash from the cressets onto the ground, then piled them[64] again with pieces of wood, to give them light, and to warm them.[65] Again for the second time Melantho scolded Odysseus:[66] “Stranger, do you mean to stay here all night and bother us[67] by poking all over the house and spying upon the women?[68] Take yourself out of the door, you wretch, and be well satisfied[69] with your feast, or you may be forced to get out, with a torch thrown at you.”[70] Then looking darkly at her resourceful Odysseus said to her:  p 488  [71] “I wonder, why do you hold such an angry grudge against me?[72] Is it because I am dirty, and wear foul clothing upon me,[73] and go about as a public beggar? The need is on me,[74] for such is the lot of vagabonds and men who are homeless.[75] I too was one who lived in my own house among people,[76] prospering in wealth, and often I gave to a wanderer[77] according to what he was and wanted when he came to me;[78] and I had serving men by thousands, and many another[79] good thing, by which men live well and are called prosperous, only[80] Zeus, son of Kronos, spoiled it all—somehow he wished to.[81] So, woman, you should now beware lest you lose all of[82] that glorious look with which you shine among the handmaidens.[83] Beware of your mistress, who may grow angry with you and hate you.[84] Or Odysseus may come back. There is still time for hope there.[85] And even if he has perished and will no longer come back,[86] here is Telemachos, his son, by grace of Apollo[87] grown such a man, and in his palace none of the women[88] will be sinful and escape, since he is a child no longer.”[89] So he spoke, and circumspect Penelope heard him,[90] and spoke to her maidservant by name and gave her a scolding:[91] “Always I know well what monstrous thing you are doing,[92] you bold and shameless bitch; you will wipe it off on your own head.[93] You understood all this very well, because you had heard it[94] from me, how in my halls I intended to question the stranger[95] about my husband; since I am troubled for him incessantly.”[96] So she spoke and addressed her housekeeper, Eurynome:[97] “Eurynome, bring up a chair and put a fleece on it,[98] so that the stranger can be seated, and tell me his story,[99] and listen also to what I say. I wish to question him.”[100] So she spoke, and the servant quickly brought up and set down[101] a well-polished chair, and laid a fleece across to cover it.[102] On this, much-enduring great Odysseus was seated,[103] and their discourse was begun by circumspect Penelope:[104] “Stranger, I myself first have a question to ask you.[105] What man are you and whence? Where is your city? Your parents?”[106] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[107] “Lady, no mortal man on the endless earth could have cause[108] to find fault with you; your fame goes up into the wide heaven,[109] as of some king who, as a blameless man and god-fearing,[110] and ruling as lord over many powerful people,[111] upholds the way of good government, and the black earth yields him[112] barley and wheat, his trees are heavy with fruit, his sheepflocks[113] continue to bear young, the sea gives him fish, because of[114] his good leadership, and his people prosper under him.[115] Question me now here in your house about all other[116] matters, but do not ask who I am, the name of my country,[117] for fear you may increase in my heart its burden of sorrow[118] as I think back; I am very full of grief, and I should not[119] sit in the house of somebody else with my lamentation[120] and wailing. It is not good to go on mourning forever.[121] Some one of your maids, or you yourself, might find fault with me[122] and say I swam in tears because my brain drowned in liquor.”  p 489  [123] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[124] “Stranger, all of my excellence, my beauty and figure,[125] were ruined by the immortals at that time when the Argives took ship[126] for Ilion, and with them went my husband, Odysseus.[127] If he were to come back to me and take care of my life, then[128] my reputation would be more great and splendid. As it is[129] now, I grieve; such evils the god has let loose upon me.[130] For all the greatest men who have the power in the islands,[131] in Doulichion and Same and in wooded Zakynthos,[132] and all who in rocky Ithaka are holders of lordships,[133] all these are my suitors against my will, and they wear my house out.[134] Therefore, I pay no attention to strangers, nor suppliants,[135] nor yet to heralds, who are in the public service, but always[136] I waste away at the inward heart, longing for Odysseus.[137] These men try to hasten the marriage. I weave my own wiles.[138] First the divinity put the idea of the web in my mind,[139] to set up a great loom in my palace, and set to weaving[140] a web of threads, long and fine. Then I said to them:[141] ‘Young men, my suitors now that the great Odysseus has perished,[142] wait, though you are eager to marry me, until I finish[143] this web, so that my weaving will not be useless and wasted.[144] This is a shroud for the hero Laertes, for when the destructive[145] doom of death which lays men low shall take him, lest any[146] Achaian woman in this neighborhood hold it against me[147] that a man of many conquests lies with no sheet to wind him.’[148] So I spoke, and the proud heart in them was persuaded.[149] Thereafter in the daytime I would weave at my great loom,[150] but in the night I would have torches set by, and undo it.[151] So for three years I was secret in my designs, convincing[152] the Achaians, but when the fourth year came with the seasons returning,[153] and the months faded, and many days had been brought to completion,[154] then at last through my maidservants, those careless hussies,[155] they learned, and came upon me and caught me, and gave me a scolding.[156] So, against my will and by force, I had to finish it.[157] Now I cannot escape from this marriage; I can no longer[158] think of another plan; my parents are urgent with me[159] to marry; my son is vexed as they eat away our livelihood;[160] he sees it all; he is a grown man now, most able[161] to care for the house, and it is to him Zeus grants this honor.[162] But even so, tell me who you are, and the place where you come from.[163] You were not born from any fabulous oak, or a boulder.”[164] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[165] “O respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,[166] you will not stop asking me about my origin?[167] Then I will tell you; but you will give me over to sorrows[168] even more than I have; but such is the way of it, when one[169] strays away from his own country as long as I have,[170] wandering many cities of men and suffering hardship.[171] Even so, I will tell you what you ask me and seek for.[172] There is a land called Crete in the middle of the wine-blue water,[173] a handsome country and fertile, seagirt, and there are many[174] peoples in it, innumerable; there are ninety cities.  p 490  [175] Language with language mix there together. There are Achaians,[176] there are great-hearted Eteokretans, there are Kydonians,[177] and Dorians in three divisions, and noble Pelasgians;[178] and there is Knossos, the great city, the place where Minos[179] was king for nine-year periods, and conversed with great Zeus.[180] He was the father of my father, great-hearted Deukalion.[181] Deukalion had two sons, myself and the lord Idomeneus,[182] but Idomeneus had gone with the curved ships to Ilion[183] along with the sons of Atreus. My glorious name was Aithon,[184] and I was the younger born, but he was the elder and better.[185] It was there that I knew Odysseus and entertained him,[186] for the force of the wind had caught him, as he was making for Ilion,[187] and brought him to Crete, driving him off course past Maleia.[188] He stopped at Amnisos, where there is a cave of Eileithyia,[189] in difficult harbors, and barely he had escaped from the stormwind.[190] He went up to the town at once, and asked for Idomeneus,[191] for he said he was his hereditary friend, and respected;[192] but it was now the tenth or eleventh day since Idomeneus[193] had gone away along with his curved ships for Ilion.[194] But I took him back to my own house, and well entertained him[195] with proper hospitality, since there was abundance[196] in the house, and for his other companions, who were his followers,[197] I collected from the public and gave them barley, and shining[198] wine, and cattle to dedicate, to content their spirits.[199] There the noble Achaians stayed twelve days, for a mighty[200] North Wind contained them, such that a man could not stand upright[201] and walk the earth. Some harsh divinity must have roused it.[202] But on the thirteenth day the wind fell, and they put forth.”[203] He knew how to say many false things that were like true sayings.[204] As she listened her tears ran and her body was melted,[205] as the snow melts along the high places of the mountains[206] when the West Wind has piled it there, but the South Wind melts it,[207] and as it melts the rivers run full flood. It was even[208] so that her beautiful cheeks were streaming tears, as Penelope[209] wept for her man, who was sitting there by her side. But Odysseus[210] in his heart had pity for his wife as she mourned him,[211] but his eyes stayed, as if they were made of horn or iron,[212] steady under his lids. He hid his tears and deceived her.[213] But when she had taken her pleasure of tearful lamentation,[214] then she answered him once again and spoke and addressed him:[215] “Now, my friend, I think I will give you a test, to see if[216] it is true that there, and with his godlike companions,[217] you entertained my husband, as you say you did, in your palace.[218] Tell me what sort of clothing he wore on his body, and what sort[219] of man he was himself, and his companions, who followed him.”[220] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[221] “Lady, it is difficult to tell you, with so much[222] time between, for now it is the twentieth year since[223] he was in that place and went away from my country.[224] Still, I will tell you, in the way my heart imagines him.[225] Great Odysseus was wearing a woolen mantle of purple,[226] with two folds, but the pin to it was golden and fashioned[227] with double sheathes, and the front part of it was artfully  p 491  [228] done: a hound held in his forepaws a dappled[229] fawn, preying on it as it struggled; and all admired it,[230] how, though they were golden, it preyed on the fawn and strangled it[231] and the fawn struggled with his feet as he tried to escape him.[232] I noticed also the shining tunic that he was wearing[233] on his body. It was like the dried-out skin of an onion,[234] so sheer it was and soft, and shining bright as the sun shines.[235] Many of the women were looking at it in admiration.[236] But put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[237] I do not know if this clothing Odysseus wore had come from[238] his home, or if some companion gave it to him as he boarded[239] his fast ship; or some friend abroad, since Odysseus had friendship[240] with many men. Indeed, there were few Achaians like him.[241] I myself gave him a brazen sword and a double[242] cloak of purple, a handsome thing, and a fringed tunic,[243] and a saw him off in the proper way on his strong-benched vessel.[244] Also there was a herald, a little older than he was,[245] who went with him. I will describe to you what he looked like.[246] He was round in the shoulders, black-complexioned, wooly-haired,[247] and had the name Eurybates. Odysseus prized him[248] above his other companions, for their thoughts were in harmony.”[249] He spoke, and still more aroused in her the passion for weeping,[250] as she recognized the certain proofs Odysseus had given.[251] But when she had taken her pleasure of tearful lamentation,[252] then once again she spoke to him and gave him an answer:[253] “Stranger, while before this you had my pity, you now shall[254] be my friend and be respected here in my palace.[255] For I myself gave him this clothing, as you describe it.[256] I folded it in my chamber, and I too attached the shining[257] pin, to be his adornment; but I shall never welcome him[258] home, come back again to the beloved land of his fathers.[259] It was on a bad day for him that Odysseus boarded[260] his hollow ship for that evil, not-to-be-mentioned Ilion.”[261] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[262] “O respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,[263] no longer waste your beautiful skin nor eat your heart out[264] in lamentation for your husband. Yet I do not blame you.[265] For any woman mourns when she loses her wedded husband,[266] with whom she has lain in love and borne children, even a lesser[267] man than Odysseus. They say that he was like the immortals.[268] But now give over your lamentation, and mark what I tell you,[269] for I say to you without deception, without concealment,[270] that I have heard of the present homecoming of Odysseus.[271] He is near, in the rich land of the men of Thesprotia,[272] and alive, and bringing many treasures back to his household.[273] He collects this about the district. His eager companions[274] were lost to him, with his hollow ship, on the wine-blue water[275] as he left the island of Thrinakia, for Zeus and Helios[276] hated him, since his companions killed the cattle of Helios.[277] So they all perished in the wash of the great sea; only[278] Odysseus, riding the keel, was cast ashore by the sea swell[279] on the land of the Phaiakians, who are near the immortals;[280] and they honored him in their hearts as if he had been a divinity,  p 492  [281] and gave him much, and they themselves were willing to carry him[282] home without harm. So Odysseus would have been home a long time[283] before this, but in his mind he thought it more profitable[284] to go about and visit much country, collecting possessions.[285] For Odysseus knew profitable ways beyond all other[286] men who are mortal, no other man could rival him at it.[287] So Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me the story;[288] and he swore to me in my presence, as he poured out a libation[289] in his house, that the ship was drawn down to the sea, and the crew were ready[290] to carry Odysseus back again to his own dear country;[291] but before that he sent me off, for a ship of Thesprotian[292] men happened then to be sailing for Doulichion, rich in wheatfields.[293] And he showed me all the possessions gathered in by Odysseus;[294] these would feed a succession of heirs to the tenth generation,[295] so many treasures are stored for him in the house of the great king.[296] But he said Odysseus had gone to Dodona, to listen[297] to the will of Zeus, out of the holy deep-leaved oak tree,[298] for how he could come back to the rich countryside of Ithaka,[299] in secret or openly, having been by now long absent.[300] So he is safe, as you see, and is now coming back. He is very[301] close at hand, and will not for long be far from his country[302] and his own people. I will swear you a firm oath to this.[303] Zeus be my witness, first of the gods, and the table of friendship,[304] and the hearth of blameless Odysseus, to which I come as a suppliant,[305] all these things are being accomplished in the way I tell them.[306] Some time within this very year Odysseus will be here,[307] either at the waning of the moon or at its onset.”[308] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[309] “If only this word, stranger and guest, were brought to fulfillment,[310] soon you would be aware of my love and many gifts given[311] by me, so any man who met you would call you blessed.[312] But here is the way I think in my mind, and the way it will happen.[313] Odysseus will never come home again, nor will you be given[314] conveyance, for there are none to give orders left in the household[315] such as Odysseus was among men—if he ever existed—[316] for receiving respected strangers and sending them off on their journeys.[317] But come, handmaidens, give him a wash and spread a couch for him[318] here, with bedding and coverlets and with shining blankets,[319] so that he can keep warm as he waits for Dawn of the golden[320] throne, and early tomorrow you shall give him a bath, anoint him,[321] so that he can sit in the hall beside Telemachos[322] and expect to dine there; and it will be the worse for any[323] of those men who inflicts heart-wasting annoyance on him;[324] he will accomplish nothing here for all his terrible[325] spite; for how, my friend, will you learn if I in any way[326] surpass the rest of women, in mind and thoughtful good sense,[327] if you must attend, badly dressed and unwashed, the feasting[328] in the palace? Human beings live for only a short time,[329] and when a man is harsh himself, and his mind knows harsh thoughts,[330] all men pray that sufferings will befall him hereafter[331] while he lives; and when he is dead all men make fun of him.  p 493  [332] But when a man is blameless himself, and his thoughts are blameless,[333] the friends he has entertained carry his fame widely[334] to all mankind, and many are they who call him excellent.”[335] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[336] “O respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,[337] coverlets and shining rugs have been hateful to me[338] ever since that time when I left the snowy mountains[339] of Crete behind me, and went away on my long-oared vessel.[340] I will lie now as I have lain before through the sleepless[341] nights; for many have been the nights when on an unpleasant[342] couch I lay and awaited the throned Dawn in her splendor.[343] Nor is there any desire in my heart for foot basins, to wash[344] my feet, nor shall any woman lay hold of my feet, not one[345] of those such as do your work for you in your palace;[346] not unless there is some aged and virtuous woman[347] whose heart has had to endure as many troubles as mine has.[348] If such a one were to touch my feet, I should not be angry.”[349] Then in turn circumspect Penelope answered:[350] “Dear friend, never before has there been any man so thoughtful,[351] among those friends from far places who have come to my palace[352] as guests, so thoughtful and so well-considered is everything[353] you say. I do have one old woman, whose thoughts are prudent,[354] who was nurse to that unhappy man, and took good care of him.[355] She took him up in her hands when first his mother had borne him,[356] and she shall wash your feet, though she has little strength for it.[357] Come then, circumspect Eurykleia, rise up and wash[358] the feet of one who is the same age as your master. Odysseus[359] must by this time have just such hands and feet as you do,[360] for in misfortune mortal men grow old more suddenly.”[361] So he spoke, and the old woman covered her face in her hands,[362] and shed hot tears, and spoke to him in words of compassion:[363] “How helpless I am to help you, my child. Surely Zeus hated you[364] beyond all other men, though you had a godly spirit;[365] for no man among mortals ever has burned so many[366] thigh pieces to Zeus who delights in the thunder, nor given so many[367] choice and grand sacrifices, as you prayed you might come to[368] a sleek old age, and raise your glorious son to manhood.[369] Now for you alone he took away your day of homecoming.[370] So it must be for him also that in the houses of far-off[371] friends, whose famous homes he enters, the women tease him,[372] as now these sluts are all teasing you, stranger, and it is[373] to avoid their abuse and shameful speaking you will not let them[374] wash your feet. But circumspect Penelope, daughter[375] of Ikarios told me to do it, nor am I unwilling.[376] So I shall wash your feet, both for the sake of Penelope[377] but also for yourself, since the heart is stirred within me[378] by sorrows; but come, attend to me and the word I tell you.[379] There have been many hard-travelling strangers who have come here,[380] but I say I have never seen one as like as you are[381] to Odysseus, both as to your feet, and voice and appearance.”[382] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[383] “So all say, old dame, who with their eyes have looked on  p 494  [384] the two of us. They say we two are very similar[385] each to each, as you yourself have noticed and tell me.”[386] So he spoke, and the old woman took up the shining basin[387] she used for foot washing, and poured in a great deal of water, the cold[388] first, and then she added the hot to it. Now Odysseus[389] was sitting close to the fire, but suddenly turned to the dark side;[390] for presently he thought in his heart that, as she handled him,[391] she might be aware of his scar, and all his story might come out.[392] She came up close and washed her lord, and at once she recognized[393] that scar, which once the boar with his white tusk had inflicted[394] on him, when he went to Parnassos, to Autolykos and his children.[395] This was his mother’s noble father, who surpassed all men[396] in thievery and the art of the oath, and the god Hermes[397] himself had endowed him, for he had pleased him by burning the thigh bones[398] of lambs and kids, and the god freely gave him his favor.[399] Autolykos came once to the rich country of Ithaka,[400] and found that a child there was newly born to his daughter;[401] and, as he finished his evening meal, Eurykleia laid him[402] upon his very knees, and spoke him a word and named him:[403] “Autolykos, now find yourself that name you will bestow[404] on your own child’s dear child, for you have prayed much to have him.”[405] Then Autolykos spoke to her and gave her an answer:[406] “My son-in-law and daughter, give him the name I tell you;[407] since I have come to this place distasteful to many, women[408] and men alike on the prospering earth, so let him be given[409] the name Odysseus, that is distasteful. Then when he grows up,[410] and comes to the great house of his mother’s line, and Parnassos,[411] where there are possessions that are called mine, I will give him[412] freely of these to make him happy, and send him back to you.”[413] This was why Odysseus came, so that he would give him[414] glorious presents. Autolykos and the sons of Autolykos[415] greeted him with clasping of hands and words of endearment,[416] and Amphithea, his mother’s mother, embraced Odysseus,[417] and kissed his head and kissed too his beautiful shining[418] eyes. Autolykos gave his glorious sons the order[419] to make ready the dinner, and they listened to his urging.[420] Presently they brought in an ox, a male, five years old.[421] They skinned the victim and put it in order, and butchered the carcass,[422] and cut the meat expertly into small pieces, and spitted the morsels,[423] and roasted all carefully, and shared out the portions.[424] So, for the whole length of the day until the sun’s setting,[425] they feasted, nor was any man’s hunger denied a fair portion;[426] but when the sun went down and the sacred darkness came over,[427] then they went to their beds and took the blessing of slumber.[428] But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,[429] they went out on their way to the hunt, the dogs and the people,[430] these sons of Autolykos, and with them noble Odysseus[431] went. They came to the steep mountain, mantled in forest,[432] Parnassos, and soon they were up in the windy folds. At this time,[433] the sun had just begun to strike on the plowlands, rising[434] out of the quiet water and the deep stream of the Ocean.  p 495  [435] The hunters came to a wooded valley, and on ahead of them[436] ran the dogs, casting about for the tracks, and behind them[437] the sons of Autolykos, and with them noble Odysseus[438] went close behind the hounds, shaking his spear far-shadowing.[439] Now there, inside that thick of the bush, was the lair of a great boar.[440] Neither could the force of wet-blown winds penetrate here,[441] nor could the shining sun ever strike through with his rays, nor yet[442] could the rain pass all the way through it, so close together[443] it grew, with a fall of leaves drifted in dense profusion.[444] The thudding made by the feet of men and dogs came to him[445] as they closed on him in the hunt, and against them he from his woodlair[446] bristled strongly his nape, and with fire from his eyes glaring[447] stood up to face them close. The first of all was Odysseus,[448] who swept in, holding high in his heavy hand the long spear,[449] and furious to stab, but too quick for him the boar drove[450] over the knee, and with his tusk gashed much of the flesh,[451] tearing sidewise, and did not reach the bone of the man. Now[452] Odysseus stabbed at him, and hit him in the right shoulder,[453] and straight on through him passed the point of the shining spearhead.[454] He screamed and dropped in the dust, and the life spirit flittered from him.[455] The dear sons of Autolykos were busy to tend him,[456] and understandingly they bound up the wound of stately[457] godlike Odysseus, and singing incantations over it[458] stayed the black blood, and soon came back to the house of their loving[459] father. Then Autolykos and the sons of Autolykos,[460] healing him well and giving him shining presents, sent him[461] speedily back rejoicing to his own beloved country[462] in Ithaka, and there his father and queenly mother[463] were glad in his homecoming, and asked about all that had happened,[464] and how he came by his wound, and he told well his story,[465] how in the hunt the boar with his white tusk had wounded him[466] as he went up to Parnassos with the sons of Autolykos.[467] The old woman, holding him in the palms of her hands, recognized[468] this scar as she handled it. She let his foot go, so that[469] his leg, which was in the basin, fell free, and the bronze echoed.[470] The basin tipped over on one side, and the water spilled out[471] on the floor. Pain and joy seized her at once, and both eyes[472] filled with tears, and the springing voice was held within her.[473] She took the beard of Odysseus in her hands and spoke to him:[474] “Then, dear child, you are really Odysseus. I did not know you[475] before; not until I had touched my lord all over.”[476] She spoke, and turned her eyes toward Penelope, wishing[477] to indicate to her her beloved husband’s presence,[478] but Penelope was not able to look that way, or perceive him,[479] since Athene turned aside her perception. Odysseus[480] groped for her, and took her by the throat with his right hand,[481] while with the other he pulled her closer to him, and said to her:[482] “Nurse, why are you trying to kill me? You yourself suckled me[483] at your own breast; and now at last after suffering[484] much, I have come, in the twentieth year, back to my own country.[485] But now that you have learned who I am, and the god put it into[486] your mind, hush, let nobody else in the palace know of it.  p 496  [487] For so I tell you straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished.[488] If you do, and by my hands the god beats down the arrogant[489] suitors, nurse of mine though you are, I will not spare you[490] when I kill the rest of the serving maids in my palace.”[491] Then in turn circumspect Eurykleia said to him:[492] “My child, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[493] You know what strength is steady in me, and it will not give way[494] at all, but I shall hold as stubborn as stone or iron.[495] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[496] If by your hands the god beats down the arrogant suitors,[497] then I will give you the list of those women who in your palace[498] have been mutinous against you, and tell you which are innocent.”[499] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[500] “Nurse, why should you tell me of them? There is no need to.[501] I myself will properly study each and learn of[502] each. Leave it to the gods and keep the story in silence.”[503] So he spoke, and the old woman went back through the hall, to fetch[504] another basin, for all the water that had been there formerly[505] was spilled. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil,[506] Odysseus drew his chair closer to the fire, trying[507] to keep warm, but hid the scar under his ragged clothing.[508] Circumspect Penelope then began their talking:[509] “Friend, I will stay here and talk to you, just for a little.[510] To be sure, it will soon be the time for sweet rest,[511] for one delicious sleep takes hold of, although he may be[512] sorrowful. The divinity gave me grief beyond measure.[513] The day times I indulge in lamentation, mourning[514] as I look to my own tasks and those of my maids in the palace.[515] But after the night comes and sleep has taken all others,[516] I lie on my bed, and the sharp anxieties swarming[517] thick and fast on my beating heart torment my sorrowing[518] self. As when Pandareos’ daughter, the greenwood nightingale,[519] perching in the deep of the forest foliage sings out[520] her lovely song, when springtime has just begun; she, varying[521] the manifold strains of her voice, pours out the melody, mourning[522] Itylos, son of the lord Zethos, her own beloved[523] child, whom she once killed with the bronze when the madness was on her;[524] so my mind is divided and starts one way, then another.[525] Shall I stay here by my son and keep all in order,[526] my property, my serving maids, and my great high-roofed house,[527] keep faith with my husband’s bed and regard the voice of the people,[528] or go away at last with the best of all those Achaians[529] who court me here in the palace, with endless gifts to win me?[530] My son, while he was still a child and thoughtless, would not[531] let me marry and leave the house of my husband; but now[532] that he is grown a tall man and come to maturity’s measure,[533] he even prays me to go home out of the palace, fretting[534] over the property, which the Achaian men are devouring.[535] But come, listen to a dream of mine and interpret it for me.[536] I have twenty geese here about the house, and they feed on[537] grains of wheat from the water trough. I love to watch them.[538] But a great eagle with crooked beak came down from the mountain,  p 497  [539] and broke the necks of them all and killed them. So the whole twenty[540] lay dead about the house, but he soared high in the bright air.[541] Then I began to weep—that was in my dream—and cried out[542] aloud, and around me gathered the fair-haired Achaian women[543] as I cried out sorrowing for my geese killed by the eagle.[544] But he came back again and perched on the jut of the gabled[545] roof. He now had a human voice and spoke aloud to me:[546] ‘Do not fear, O daughter of far-famed Ikarios.[547] This is no dream, but a blessing real as day. You will see it[548] done. The geese are the suitors, and I, the eagle, have been[549] a bird of portent, but now I am your own husband, come home,[550] and I shall inflict shameless destruction on all the suitors.’[551] So he spoke; and then the honey-sweet sleep released me,[552] and I looked about and saw the geese in my palace, feeding[553] on their grains of wheat from the water trough, just as they had been.”[554] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[555] “Lady, it is impossible to read this dream and avoid it[556] by turning another way, since Odysseus himself has told you[557] its meaning, how it will end. The suitors’ doom is evident[558] for one and all. Not one will avoid his death and destruction.”[559] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[560] “My friend, dreams are things hard to interpret, hopeless to puzzle[561] out, and people find that not all of them end in anything.[562] There are two gates through which the insubstantial dreams issue.[563] One pair of gates is made of horn, and one of ivory.[564] Those of the dreams which issue through the gate of sawn ivory,[565] these are deceptive dreams, their message is never accomplished.[566] But those that come into the open through the gates of the polished[567] horn accomplish the truth for any mortal who sees them.[568] I do not think that this strange dream that I had came to me[569] through this gate. My son and I would be glad if it did so.[570] And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.[571] This dawn will be a day of evil name, which will take me[572] away from the house of Odysseus; for now I will set up a contest:[573] those axes which, in his palace, he used to set up in order[574] so that, twelve in all, they stood in a row, like timbers[575] to hold a ship. He would stand far off, and send a shaft through them.[576] Now I will set these up as a contest before my suitors,[577] and the one who takes the bow in his hands, strings it with the greatest[578] ease, and sends an arrow clean through all the twelve axes[579] shall be the one I will go away with, forsaking this house[580] where I was a bride, a lovely place and full of good living.[581] I think that even in my dreams I shall never forget it.”[582] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[583] “O respected wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes,[584] do not put off this contest in your house any longer.[585] Before these people can handle the well-wrought bow, and manage[586] to hook the string and bend it, and send a shaft through the iron,[587] Odysseus of the many designs will be back here with you.”[588] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[589] “If, my friend, you were willing to sit by me in my palace[590] and entertain me, no sleep would be drifted over my eyelids.  p 498  [591] But it is in no way possible for people forever[592] to go without sleep; and the immortals have given to mortals[593] each his own due share all over the grain-giving corn land.[594] So I shall now go back again to my upper chamber,[595] and lie on my bed, which is made a sorrowful thing now, always[596] disordered with the tears I have wept, ever since Odysseus[597] went away to that evil, not-to-be-mentioned Ilion.[598] There I must lie; but you can sleep here in the house, either[599] bedding down on the floor, or they can make a bed for you.”[600] So she spoke, and went back up to her shining chamber,[601] not alone, since others, her women, went to attend her.[602] She went back to the upper story with her attendant[603] women, and wept for Odysseus, her beloved husband, until[604] gray-eyed Athene cast sweet slumber over her eyelids.book twenty[1] Then the noble Odysseus bedded down in the forecourt,[2] and spread beneath him the raw hide of an ox, and uppermost[3] many fleeces of sheep the Achaians had dedicated.[4] When he had lain down, Eurynome threw a blanket over him.[5] There, devising evils in his heart for the suitors,[6] Odysseus lay awake; and out of the palace issued[7] those women who in the past had been going to bed with the suitors,[8] full of cheerful spirits and greeting each other with laughter.[9] But the spirit deep in the heart of Odysseus was stirred by this,[10] and much he pondered in the division of mind and spirit,[11] whether to spring on them and kill each one, or rather[12] to let them lie this one more time with the insolent suitors,[13] for the last and latest time; but the heart was growling within him.[14] And as a bitch, facing an unknown man, stands over[15] her callow puppies, and growls and rages to fight, so Odysseus’[16] heart was growling inside him as he looked on these wicked actions.[17] He struck himself on the chest and spoke to his heart and scolded it:[18] “Bear up, my heart. You have had worse to endure before this[19] on that day when the irresistible Cyclops ate up[20] my strong companions, but you endured it until intelligence[21] got you out of the cave, though you expected to perish.”[22] So he spoke, addressing his own dear heart within him;[23] and the heart in great obedience endured and stood it[24] without complaint, but the man himself was twisting and turning.[25] And as a man with a paunch pudding, that has been filled with[26] blood and fat, tosses it back and forth over a blazing[27] fire, and the pudding itself strains hard to be cooked quickly;[28] so he was twisting and turning back and forth, meditating[29] how, though he was alone against many, he could lay hands on[30] the shameless suitors. And at this time Athene, descending[31] from the sky, came close to him, and wore the shape of a lady.[32] She came and stood above his head, and spoke a word to him:[33] “Why are you wakeful now, O most wretched of all men?[34] Here is your house, and here is your wife in the house, and here is[35] your son; and he is the kind of son any man would long for.”  p 499  [36] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[37] “Yes, O goddess, all you have said was fair and orderly;[38] yet still, here is something the heart inside me is pondering,[39] how, when I am alone against many, I can lay hands on[40] the shameless suitors. And they are always here in a body.[41] And here is a still bigger problem that my heart is pondering.[42] Even if, by grace of Zeus and yourself, I kill them,[43] how shall I make my escape? It is what I would have you think on.”[44] Then in turn the goddess, gray-eyed Athene, said to him:[45] “Stubborn man! Anyone trusts even a lesser companion[46] than I, who is mortal, and does not have so many ideas.[47] But I am a god, and through it all I keep watch over you[48] in every endeavor of yours. And now I tell you this plainly:[49] even though there were fifty battalions of mortal people[50] standing around us, furious to kill in the spirit of battle,[51] even so you could drive away their cattle and fat sheep.[52] So let sleep take you now. There is annoyance in lying[53] awake and on guard all night. You will soon be out of your troubles.”[54] So she spoke, and scattered slumber over his eyelids,[55] and she, shining among goddesses, went back to Olympos.[56] But when the sleep had caught him, a relaxing sleep, slipping[57] the cares from his mind, at that time his virtuous wife wakened[58] in turn, and cried, sitting up in her soft bed. But after[59] she had satisfied all her desire with weeping, then she,[60] shining among women, prayed first of all to Artemis:[61] “Artemis, goddess and queen, daughter of Zeus, how I wish[62] that with the cast of your arrow you could take the life from inside[63] my heart, this moment, or that soon the stormwind would snatch me[64] away, and be gone, carrying me down misty pathways,[65] and set me down where the recurrent Ocean empties[66] his stream; as once the stormwinds carried away the daughters[67] of Pandareos. The gods killed their parents, and they were left there[68] orphaned in the palace, and radiant Aphrodite[69] tended them and fed them with cheese, and sweet honey, and pleasant[70] wine; and Hera granted to them, beyond all women,[71] beauty and good sense, and chaste Artemis gave them stature,[72] and Athene instructed them in glorious handiwork.[73] But when bright Aphrodite had gone up to tall Olympos[74] to request for these girls the achievement of blossoming marriage,[75] from Zeus who rejoices in the thunder—and he well knows[76] all things, the luck and the lucklessness of mortal people—[77] meanwhile the seizing stormwinds carried away these maidens[78] and gave them over into the care of the hateful Furies.[79] So I wish that they who have their homes on Olympos[80] would make me vanish, or sweet-haired Artemis strike me, so that[81] I could meet the Odysseus I long for, even under the hateful[82] earth, and not have to please the mind of an inferior[83] husband. Yet the evil is endurable, when one[84] cries through the days, with heart constantly troubled, yet still[85] is taken by sleep in the nights; for sleep is oblivion of all[86] things, both good and evil, when it has shrouded the eyelids.[87] But now the god has sent the evil dreams thronging upon me.[88] For on this very night there was one who lay by me, like him  p 500  [89] as he was when he went with the army, so that my own heart[90] was happy. I thought it was no dream, but a waking vision.”[91] So she spoke, and Dawn of the golden throne came on her.[92] Great Odysseus was aware of her voice crying,[93] and pondered then, and it seemed to him in his mind that now[94] she was standing by his head, and had recognized him already.[95] He rolled together the blanket and fleece, where he had been sleeping,[96] and laid them down by the chair in the hall, and taking the oxhide[97] out, laid it down, and prayed to Zeus, with his hands lifted.[98] “Father Zeus, if willingly you gods led me over[99] wet and dry to my land, after giving too much affliction,[100] let one of the waking people send me an omen from inside[101] the house; and let Zeus also show me an outside portent.”[102] So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels heard him.[103] Immediately he sent his thunder from shining Olympos[104] high above the clouds, and noble Odysseus was happy.[105] And from the house a mill woman sent him an omen.[106] She was near by, where the shepherd of the host had set up[107] his hand mills, and there twelve women in all had been bending[108] to grind the wheat and the barley flour, men’s marrow. The others,[109] since they had finished grinding their wheat, by now were sleeping,[110] but this one had not ended her work, and she was the weakest.[111] She stopped the mill and spoke aloud, a sign for her master:[112] “Father Zeus, you who are lord of the gods and people,[113] now you have thundered loud from the starry sky, although[114] there is no cloud. You show this forth, a portent for someone.[115] Grant now also for wretched me this prayer that I make you.[116] On this day let the suitors take, for the last and latest[117] time, their desirable feasting in the halls of Odysseus.[118] For it is they who have broken my knees with heart-sore labor[119] as I grind the meal for them. Let this be their final feasting.”[120] So she spoke, and great Odysseus welcomed the ominous[121] speech, and the thunder of Zeus. He thought he would punish the sinners.[122] The other serving women in the fine house of Odysseus[123] had gathered, and were lighting the weariless fire on the fireplace.[124] Telemachos, a man like a god, rose up from his bed[125] and put on his clothes, and slung a sharp sword over his shoulder.[126] Underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,[127] and then caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze.[128] He came and stood on the threshold and spoke now to Eurykleia:[129] “Dear nurse, how have you treated the stranger-guest in our house?[130] With food and a bed? Or has he been left to lie uncared-for?[131] That is the way my mother is, though she is sensible.[132] Impulsively she favors the wrong man, the worse one[133] among mortals, and lets the better man go, unfavored.”[134] Then in turn circumspect Eurykleia said to him:[135] “Child, do not find fault with her this time. She is blameless.[136] For he sat here and drank his wine, as he himself wanted,[137] but he said he had no more hunger for food. She asked him.[138] But afterward, when he was thinking of rest and sleep, then[139] she did tell the serving women to make up his bedding,[140] but it was he, as one forever wretched and without  p 501  [141] fortune, who would not sleep in a bed, nor under blankets,[142] but in the raw hide of an ox and under fleeces[143] he slept in the forecourt, and we put a blanket over him.”[144] So she spoke, and Telemachos went out through the palace,[145] holding his spear, and a pair of light-footed dogs went with him.[146] He went off to the assembly to join the strong-greaved Achaians.[147] But Eurykleia, shining among women, the daughter[148] of Ops, the son of Peisenor, gave orders to the maidservants:[149] “To work. Some of you keep busy sweeping the palace,[150] and freshen the floor with water, and lay the purple coverlets[151] over the well-wrought chairs. Some others, wash all the tables[152] thoroughly clear with sponges, and clean the wine bowls, also[153] the wrought and double-handled drinking-cups; others, be off[154] now to the spring to fetch the water, and come back quickly.[155] For the suitors will not long be away from the palace,[156] but will arrive very early, since this is a public festival.”[157] So she spoke, and they listened well to her, and obeyed her,[158] and twenty of them went on their way to the spring of dark water,[159] while others, remaining in the house, did their work expertly.[160] Then the haughty menservants came in, and these presently[161] split the firewood well and expertly, and now the women[162] came back from the spring, and next after them came in the swineherd[163] driving in three porkers, which were the best in his keeping.[164] These he left to graze inside the handsome enclosure,[165] while he himself spoke to Odysseus in words of endearment:[166] “Friend, have the Achaians been giving you more regard, or[167] do they slight you still in the halls, as they did earlier?”[168] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[169] “How I wish, Eumaios, the gods would punish the outrage[170] these men do in the violence of their reckless designs, here in[171] the house of another man. They have no gift of modesty.”[172] Now as these two were conversing thus with each other,[173] Melanthios, who was the herdsman of the goats, approached them,[174] driving the goats that showed the best in all of his goatflocks[175] to be the suitors’ dinner. Two other herdsmen followed him.[176] Melanthios tethered the goats under the echoing portico,[177] and he himself now spoke to Odysseus, in terms of revilement:[178] “Stranger, are you still to be here in the house, to pester[179] the gentlemen with your begging? Will you not take yourself outside[180] and elsewhere? I think that now you and I can no longer[181] part, until we have tried our fists. There is nothing orderly[182] about your begging. And other Achaians are feasting elsewhere.”[183] So he spoke. Resourceful Odysseus gave him no answer,[184] but shook his head in silence, deeply devising evils.[185] The third man to come in was Philoitios, leader of people,[186] driving in for the suitors a barren cow, and fat goats.[187] The ferryman had brought these over; they give conveyance[188] to people generally besides, whoever comes to them.[189] Philoitios tethered the beasts well under the echoing portico,[190] then went himself and stood close by the swineherd, and asked him:[191] “Who is this stranger, swineherd, newly arrived to visit[192] this house of ours? From what people does he claim origin?  p 502  [193] Where is his ancestral place and the land of his fathers?[194] Unlucky man; he is like a king and a lord in appearance.[195] Yet it is true; the homeless men are those whom the gods hold[196] in despite, when they spin misery even for princes.”[197] He spoke, and stood close by Odysseus, and offered his right hand,[198] and spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words, saying:[199] “Welcome, father and stranger; may prosperous days befall you[200] hereafter; but now you are held in the grip of many misfortunes.[201] Father Zeus, no god beside is more baleful than you are.[202] You have no pity on men, once you yourself have created[203] them; you bring them into misfortune and dismal sufferings.[204] It has come home to me, when I saw it. My eyes are tearful[205] as I remember Odysseus, since I think he too is wearing[206] such rags upon him as this, and wandering among peoples[207] if he is alive at all anywhere, and looks on the sunlight.[208] But if he is now dead and gone to the house of Hades,[209] I mourn then for blameless Odysseus, who when I was little[210] set me in charge of his oxen in the Kephallenian country.[211] Now these cattle are marvelously grown, nor could one[212] better gather an increase of broad-faced cattle than as[213] these are bred. But other men tell me to drive them to them[214] to eat, and they care nothing about the son in the palace,[215] nor tremble before the gods’ regard; now they are grown eager[216] to divide the possessions of the master, who has been absent[217] long. But here is a problem that the heart deep within me[218] has long resolved. While the son is here, it would be cowardly[219] to take my cattle with me and go to another district[220] and alien men; and yet again it grows worse to stay here,[221] as one set in charge of other men’s cattle, and suffer hardships.[222] And long ago I would have escaped from here, and gone to[223] some other powerful king, since this is no longer endurable;[224] yet still I think of that luckless man, how he may come back[225] and all throughout the house may cause the suitors to scatter.”[226] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[227] “Oxherd, since you seem like neither a bad nor a senseless[228] man—and I myself know what good sense is in you—[229] so I will tell you this, and swear a great oath upon it.[230] Zeus be my witness, first of the gods, and the table of friendship,[231] and the hearth of blameless Odysseus, to which I come as a suppliant;[232] Odysseus will come home again, while you are still here[233] in the house, and with your own eyes, if you desire to,[234] you can watch him killing the suitors, who are supreme here.”[235] Then the herdsman of oxen spoke in turn and answered him:[236] “How I wish, my friend, that the son of Kronos would make good[237] your saying; then you would see what kind of strength my hands have.”[238] So Eumaios also prayed to all the divinities[239] that they would grant the homecoming of thoughtful Odysseus.[240] Now as these men were conversing thus with each other,[241] the suitors were compacting their plan of death and destruction[242] for Telemachos, and a bird flew over them on the left side.[243] This was a high-flown eagle, and carried a tremulous pigeon.[244] Now it was Amphinomos who spoke forth and addressed them:  p 503  [245] “O friends, this plan of ours to murder Telemachos will not[246] ever be brought to completion; so let us think of our feasting.”[247] So Amphinomos spoke, and his word was acceptable to them.[248] They, when they had entered the house of godlike Odysseus,[249] laid their mantles down along the chairs and the benches,[250] and set about sacrificing great-sized sheep, and fat goats,[251] and sacrificing an ox of the herd, and fattened porkers.[252] They roasted the vitals and distributed them, and they blended[253] the wine in the mixing bowls, and the swineherd passed the wine cups[254] about, and Philoitios, leader of men, served them the bread[255] in beautiful baskets, and Melanthios poured the wine for them.[256] They put forth their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.[257] Telemachos, his heart full of guile, seated Odysseus[258] inside the well-constructed hall, and by the stone threshold,[259] setting down a poor chair for him, and a little table,[260] and set before him a portion of vitals, and poured wine for him[261] in a golden drinking cup, and then he spoke a word to him:[262] “Take your place here and drink your wine in the men’s company.[263] I myself will defend you against the blows and the insults[264] of all the suitors. This house does not belong to the people,[265] but it belongs to Odysseus; he acquired it; this makes it[266] mine; and so, you suitors, hold back your spirit for insults[267] and blows, or else there may be a quarrel and fight between us.”[268] So he spoke, and all of them bit their lips in amazement[269] at Telemachos, and the daring way he had spoken to them.[270] Now Antinoös, the son of Eupeithes, said to them:[271] “We Achaians must accept the word of Telemachos,[272] though it is hard. Now he threatens us very strongly.[273] Zeus, son of Kronos, stopped us; otherwise we should before now[274] have put him down in his halls, though he is a lucid speaker.”[275] So spoke Antinoös, but the other paid no attention.[276] The heralds came through the town driving the holy hecatomb[277] of the gods, and the flowing-haired Achaians assembled under[278] the shady grove of him who strikes from afar, Apollo.[279] When they had roasted and taken off the spits the outer[280] meats, dividing shares they held their communal high feast.[281] Then they who were working set down before Odysseus an equal[282] portion, such as they got themselves, for this was the order[283] of Telemachos, beloved son of godlike Odysseus.[284] And yet Athene would not altogether permit the arrogant[285] suitors to keep from heart-hurting outrage, so to make greater[286] the anguish in the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes.[287] There was a man among the suitors versed in villainy;[288] Ktesippos was his name, and he had his home in Same.[289] He, in the confidence of his amazing possessions,[290] courted the wife of Odysseus, who had been so long absent.[291] This man now spoke forth among the insolent suitors:[292] “Hear me now, you haughty suitors, while I say something.[293] The stranger has had his share long since, and, as is proper,[294] an equal one; for it is not well nor just to make light of[295] the guests of Telemachos, who come to him in his palace.[296] Come, let me too give him a guest gift, so he can give it  p 504  [297] as prize to the woman who washes his feet, or to some other[298] one of the servants in the house of godlike Odysseus.”[299] He spoke, and with his heavy hand he caught up an ox hoof[300] that lay by in the basket, and threw it. Odysseus avoided[301] this by an easy shift of his head. He smiled in his anger[302] a very sardonic smile. The hoof hit the wall of the well-built[303] house, and Telemachos spoke now and scolded Ktesippos:[304] “Ktesippos, it was the better for your heart that it happened[305] so; you missed the stranger, he avoided your missile.[306] I would have struck you with my sharp spear fair in the middle,[307] and instead of your marriage your father would have been busy[308] with your funeral here. Let none display any rudeness[309] here in my house. I now notice all and know of it, better[310] and worse alike, but before now I was only an infant.[311] Even so, we have had to look on this and endure it[312] all, the sheepflocks being slaughtered, the wine drunk up,[313] and the food, since it is hard for one man to stand off many.[314] Come then, no longer do me harm in your hostility.[315] But if you are determined to murder me with the sharp bronze,[316] then that would be my wish also, since it would be far better[317] than to have to go on watching forever these shameful activities,[318] guests being battered about, or to see you rudely mishandling[319] the serving women all about the beautiful palace.”[320] So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.[321] At last Agelaos, son of Damastor, spoke forth among them:[322] “Dear friends, no man must be angry, nor yet with violent[323] answers attack what has been spoken injustice. And do not[324] strike the stranger, as you have done, nor yet any other[325] serving man who is in the house of godlike Odysseus.[326] But, to Telemachos and his mother, I offer gentle[327] advice, if this might be pleasing to the hearts of both of them.[328] As long as the spirits in the hearts of you both were hopeful[329] that Odysseus of the many designs would have his homecoming,[330] then no one could blame you for waiting for him, and holding[331] the suitors off in the palace, since that was the better way for you[332] in case Odysseus did come home and return to his palace.[333] But now it has become evident that he never will come back.[334] Come then; sit beside your mother and give her this counsel,[335] to marry the one who is the best man and brings the most numerous[336] gifts. So you can be happy, control your father’s inheritance,[337] and eat and drink, while she looks after the house of another.”[338] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[339] “But, by Zeus, Agelaos, I swear, and by the sufferings[340] of my father, who has died or is driven far from Ithaka,[341] I do not delay my mother’s marriage; rather I urge her[342] to marry the one she wants, and I offer them countless presents.[343] But I am ashamed to drive her unwilling out of the palace[344] with a strict word. May this not be the end god makes of it.”[345] So spoke Telemachos. In the suitors Pallas Athene[346] stirred up uncontrollable laughter, and addled their thinking.[347] Now they laughed with jaws that were no longer their own.[348] The meat they ate was a mess of blood, their eyes were bursting  p 505  [349] full of tears, and their laughter sounded like lamentation.[350] Godlike Theoklymenos now spoke out among them:[351] “Poor wretches, what evil has come on you? Your heads and faces[352] and the knees underneath you are shrouded in night and darkness;[353] a sound of wailing has broken out, your cheeks are covered[354] with tears, and the walls bleed, and the fine supporting pillars.[355] All the forecourt is huddled with ghosts, the yard is full of them[356] as they flock down to the underworld and the darkness. The sun[357] has perished out of the sky, and a foul mist has come over.”[358] So he spoke, and all of them laughed happily at him.[359] Eurymachos, son of Polybos, began speaking among them:[360] “This stranger newly come from elsewhere has lost his senses.[361] Come, young men, and give him an escort out of the palace[362] to get to the marketplace, since everything here is darkness.”[363] Then in turn godlike Theoklymenos answered:[364] “Eurymachos, I do not want you to give me an escort.[365] I have eyes and I have ears, and I have both my feet,[366] and a mind inside my breast which is not without understanding.[367] These will take me outside the house, since I see the evil[368] coming upon you, and not one of the suitors avoiding[369] this will escape; for in the house of godlike Odysseus[370] you are outrageous to men, and all your designs are reckless.”[371] So he spoke, and walked out of the well-settled palace,[372] and made his way to Peiraios, who hospitably received him.[373] But the suitors now were glancing one at another, trying[374] to tease Telemachos about his guests, and laughing over them;[375] and thus would go the word of one of the arrogant young men:[376] “No one has worse luck with his guests than you, Telemachos.[377] Here, for one, somebody brought you in this vagabond[378] who wants his food and his wine, who does not know how to do any[379] work, who has no strength, but is just a weight on the good land.[380] And now this other one stood up and began to prophesy.[381] If you would listen to what I say, it would be far better.[382] Let us put these guests in a vessel with many oarlocks[383] and take them to the Sicilians. There they would fetch a good price.”[384] So spoke the suitors, but Telemachos paid no attention,[385] but looked across at his father silently, always waiting[386] for the time when he would lay his hands on the shameless suitors.[387] The daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[388] had taken her beautiful chair and set it just outside the door,[389] and listened to every word the men in the hall were saying.[390] For these were laughing aloud as they prepared a dinner[391] that was sweet and staying, for they had made a very big sacrifice;[392] but there could not be a meal that was more unpleasant than this one,[393] such was to be the attack that the powerful man and the goddess[394] would make on them. For they had first begun the wrongdoing.  p 506  book twenty-one[1] But now the goddess, gray-eyed Athene, put it in the mind[2] of the daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[3] to set the bow before the suitors, and the gray iron,[4] in the house of Odysseus: the contest, the beginning of the slaughter.[5] So she ascended the high staircase of her own house,[6] and in her solid hand took up the beautiful, brazen[7] and artfully curved key, with an ivory handle upon it.[8] With her attendant women she went to the inmost recess[9] of the chamber. There were stored away the master’s possessions.[10] Bronze was there, and gold, and difficulty wrought iron,[11] and there the backstrung bow was stored away, and the quiver[12] to hold the arrows. There were many painful shafts inside it.[13] These were gifts from a friend whom he met in Lakedaimon.[14] Iphitos, son of Eurytos, one like the immortal[15] gods. These two, in Messene, had encountered each other[16] in the house of wise Ortilochos, at the time when Odysseus[17] went there on an errand enjoined by the whole community.[18] For men of Messene had come in ships with many oarlocks[19] and lifted three hundred sheep from Ithaka, also the herdsmen[20] with them, so Odysseus traveled far on the embassy[21] while still a boy, sent by his father and the rest of the elders.[22] Iphitos was there in search of his horses, twelve mares[23] he had lost; hard-working mule colts were with them, nursing.[24] These mares presently were to mean his doom and murder,[25] at the time when he came to the son of Zeus, strong-hearted,[26] the man called Herakles, guilty of monstrous actions,[27] who killed Iphitos while he was a guest in his household;[28] hard man, without shame for the watchful gods, nor the table[29] he had set for Iphitos, his guest; and when he had killed him[30] he kept the strong-footed horses for himself in his palace.[31] In search of his mares, Iphitos met Odysseus, and gave him[32] the bow, which once the great Eurytos had carried, and left it[33] afterward to his son when he had died in his high house.[34] Odysseus gave him in turn a sharp sword and a strong spear,[35] to begin their considerate friendship, but these two never[36] entertained each other; before that, the son of Zeus killed[37] Iphitos, son of Eurytos, one like the immortal[38] gods, who gave Odysseus the bow. But Odysseus never[39] took it with him when he went to war on the black ships,[40] but always it was stored away in his halls, in memory[41] of a dear friend; but he carried it at home in his country.[42] When she, shining among women, had come to the chamber,[43] and had come up to the oaken threshold, which the carpenter[44] once had expertly planed and drawn it true to a chalkline,[45] and fitted the door post to it and joined on the shining door leaves,[46] first she quickly set the fastening free of the hook, then[47] she inserted the key and knocked the bolt upward, pushing[48] the key straight in, and the door bellowed aloud, as a bull  p 507  [49] does, when he feeds in his pasture; such was the noise the splendid[50] doors made, struck with the key, and now they quickly spread open.[51] Then she went up to the high platform, where there were standing[52] chests, and in these were stored fragrant pieces of clothing.[53] From there she reached, and took the bow from its peg, where it hung,[54] in its own case, a shining thing that covered it. Thereupon[55] she sat down, and laid the bow on her dear knees, while she[56] took her lord’s bow out of its case, all the while weeping[57] aloud. But when she had sated herself with tears and crying,[58] she went on her way to the hall to be with the lordly suitors,[59] bearing in her hand the backstrung bow, and the quiver[60] to hold the arrows, with many sorrowful shafts inside it.[61] Her serving women carried the box for her, and there lay[62] much iron and bronze, prizes that had been won by the master.[63] When she, shining among women, came near the suitors,[64] she stood by the pillar that supported the roof with its joinery,[65] holding her shining veil in front of her face, to shield it,[66] and a devoted attendant was stationed on either side of her.[67] Now at once she spoke and addressed a word to the suitors:[68] “Hear me now, you haughty suitors, who have been using[69] this house for your incessant eating and drinking, though it[70] belongs to a man who has been gone for a long time; never[71] have you been able to bring any other saying before me,[72] but only your desire to make me your wife and marry me.[73] But come, you suitors, since here is a prize set out before you;[74] for I shall bring you the great bow of godlike Odysseus.[75] And the one who takes the bow in his hands, strings it with the greatest[76] ease, and sends an arrow clean through all the twelve axes,[77] shall be the one I go away with, forsaking this house[78] where I was a bride, a lovely place and full of good living.[79] I think that even in my dreams I shall never forget it.”[80] So she spoke, and told the noble swineherd, Eumaios,[81] to put the bow and the gray iron in front of the suitors.[82] Eumaios accepted it, in tears, and put them before them,[83] and the oxherd also wept, when he saw the bow of his master,[84] but Antinoös scolded the two of them, and spoke out and named them:[85] “You foolish countrymen, who never think of tomorrow,[86] poor wretches, why are you streaming tears, and troubling the lady[87] now, and stirring her heart, when she has enough already[88] of sadness her heart rests on, now she has lost a dear husband.[89] Go and sit in silence and eat, or else take your crying[90] out of the door and begone, but leave the bow where you put it,[91] a prize for the suitors to strive for; a terrible one; I do not think[92] that this well-polished bow can ever be strung easily.[93] There is no man among the lot of us who is such a one[94] as Odysseus used to be. I myself have seen him,[95] and I remember well, though I was still young and childish.”[96] So he spoke, but the spirit inside his heart was hopeful[97] that he would be able to string the bow and shoot through the iron;[98] but he was to be the first to get a taste of the arrow[99] from the hands of blameless Odysseus, to whom he now paid no attention[100] as he sat in Odysseus’ halls and encouraged all his companions.  p 508  [101] Now the hallowed prince, Telemachos, spoke his word to them:[102] “Ah, how Zeus, the son of Kronos, has made me witless.[103] My own beloved mother, though she is sensible, tells me[104] that she will forsake this house and go away with another;[105] and then, in the witlessness of my heart, I laugh and enjoy it.[106] But come, you suitors, since here is a prize set out before you,[107] a woman; there is none like her in all the Achaian country,[108] neither in sacred Pylos nor Argos nor in Mykene,[109] nor here in Ithaka itself, nor on the dark mainland.[110] You yourselves also know this; then why should I praise my mother?[111] But come, no longer drag things out with delays, nor turn back[112] still from the stringing of the bow, so that we may see it.[113] I myself am also willing to attempt the bow. Then,[114] if I can put the string on it and shoot through the iron,[115] my queenly mother would not go off with another, and leave me[116] sorrowing here in the house; since I would still be found here[117] as one now able to take up his father’s glorious prizes.”[118] He spoke, and sprang upright, laying aside from his shoulders[119] the red cloak, and from his shoulders too took off the sharp sword.[120] He began by setting up the axes, digging[121] one long trench for them all, and drawing it true to a chalkline,[122] and stamped down the earth around them; wonder seized the onlookers[123] at how orderly he set them up. He never had seen them[124] before. He went then and tried the bow, standing on the threshold.[125] Three times he made it vibrate, straining to bend it, and three times[126] he gave over the effort, yet in his heart was hopeful[127] of hooking the string to the bow and sending a shaft through the iron.[128] And now, pulling the bow for the fourth time, he would have strung it,[129] but Odysseus stopped him, though he was eager, making a signal[130] with his head. The hallowed prince, Telemachos, said to them:[131] “Shame on me. I must be then a coward and weakling,[132] or else I am still young, and my hands have yet no confidence[133] to defend myself against a man who has started a quarrel.[134] Come then, you who in your strength are greater than I am,[135] make your attempts on the bow, and let us finish the contest.”[136] So he spoke, and put the bow from him, leaning it[137] on the ground, and against the compacted and polished door leaves,[138] and in the same place leaned the swift shaft against the fine handle,[139] and went back and sat in the chair from which he had risen.[140] Now Antinoös the son of Eupeithes said to them:[141] “Take your turns in order from left to right, my companions[142] all, beginning from the place where the wine is served out.”[143] So spoke Antinoös, and his word was pleasing to all of them.[144] Leodes was the first to arise: the son of Oinops,[145] who was a diviner among them, and sat always in the corner[146] beside the fine mixing bowl. To him alone their excesses[147] were hateful, and he disapproved of all of the suitors.[148] He was the first to take up the bow and the swift arrow[149] now. He went then and tried the bow, standing on the threshold,[150] and could not string it; before that he ruined his soft, uncalloused[151] hands, pulling at the string, and now he spoke to the suitors:[152] “Friends, I cannot string this; let one of the others take it.  p 509  [153] Here is a bow such that it will sunder many of the princes[154] from life and soul, since truly it is far better to die[155] than go on living and fail of that for whose sake we forever[156] keep on gathering here, all our days in expectation.[157] Now a man may be hopeful and in his heart desirous[158] of marrying Penelope, the wife of Odysseus.[159] But when the bow has been attempted, and all is made plain,[160] then one must court some other fair-robed Achaian woman,[161] and strive to win her with gifts of courtship; she will then marry[162] the man she is fated to have and who brings her the greatest presents.”[163] So he spoke, and put the bow from him, leaning it[164] on the ground, and against the compacted and polished door leaves,[165] and in the same place leaned the swift shaft against the fine handle,[166] and went back and sat in the chair from which he had risen.[167] But now Antinoös scolded him, and spoke out and named him:[168] “Leodes, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[169] A terrible and shameful word. I am outraged to hear it;[170] if this is to be such a bow that will sunder the princes[171] from life and soul, because you are unable to string it.[172] You were not such a one, when the lady your mother bore you,[173] as ever to be able to manage the bow and the arrows.[174] But presently the other lordly suitors will string it.”[175] So he spoke, and now urged Melanthios the goatherd:[176] “Come now, Melanthios, light us a fire inside the palace,[177] and set beside it a great chair with fleeces upon it,[178] and bring out from the inside stores a great wheel of tallow,[179] so that we young men, having heated the bow and rubbed it[180] with fat, can then attempt to bend it, and finish the contest.”[181] So he spoke, and Melanthios quickly kindled the weariless[182] fire, and brought out the chair, and laid the fleeces upon it,[183] and brought out from the inside stores a great wheel of tallow.[184] The young men heated the bow and tried it, but were not able[185] to string it. They were not nearly strong enough. All this time[186] Antinoös still held back, as did godlike Eurymachos,[187] those lords of the suitors, out and away the best men among them.[188] Two men, the oxherd and the swineherd of godlike Odysseus,[189] went out of the house, in company keeping close together,[190] and great Odysseus himself came from the house to join them.[191] But after they were out of the way of the doors and the courtyard,[192] Odysseus spoke to the two of them in words of endearment:[193] “Oxherd, and you too, swineherd, shall I say something to you,[194] or keep it hidden within? My spirit tells me to speak out.[195] What sort of fight would you put up in defense of Odysseus,[196] if he were to come suddenly, so, with the god leading him?[197] Would you fight for the suitors, or would you fight for Odysseus?[198] Tell me what your heart and spirit would have you answer.”[199] Then the herdsman of oxen spoke in turn and answered him:[200] “Father Zeus, if you would achieve this prayer I ask for,[201] that the man himself would come home with the divinity guiding him,[202] then you yourself would see what kind of strength my hands have.”[203] So Eumaios also prayed to all the divinities[204] that they would grant the homecoming of thoughtful Odysseus.  p 510  [205] But when Odysseus had recognized the infallible temper[206] of these men, then he spoke to them again and answered them:[207] “I am he. I am here in my house. After many sufferings[208] I have come home in the twentieth year to the land of my fathers.[209] And now I see that of all my men it was only you two[210] who wanted me to come; I have not heard one of the others[211] praying that I should return again and come to my own house.[212] Therefore I will tell you the truth, and so it shall be;[213] if by my hand the god overmasters the lordly suitors,[214] then I shall get wives for you both, and grant you possessions[215] and houses built next to mine, and think of you in the future[216] always as companions of Telemachos, and his brothers.[217] But come now, let me show you a proof that shall be manifest,[218] so that you may know me for sure and trust my identity;[219] that scar, which once the boar with his white tooth inflicted[220] on me, when I went to Parnassos with the sons of Autolykos.”[221] So he spoke, and pushed back the rags that covered his great scar.[222] When these two had examined it and recognized everything,[223] they burst out weeping and threw their arms around wise Odysseus,[224] and made much of him, and kissed him on his head and his shoulders,[225] and so Odysseus also kissed their heads and hands. Now[226] the sun would have gone down while they were still thus clamoring,[227] had not Odysseus stayed them from it and said a word to them:[228] “Now stop your lamentation and wailing, or someone may come out[229] from the hall and see us, and tell about it inside. So rather[230] let us go in severally, not all together,[231] I first, you after me, but let us have this as a signal[232] arranged; for all the others there, who are lordly suitors,[233] will not say that you can give me the bow and the quiver;[234] but you must carry the bow through the house, noble Eumaios,[235] and put it into my hands, and then you must tell the women[236] to bar the tightly fitted doors that close the hall; tell them,[237] if any of them hears from inside the crash and the outcry,[238] of men who are caught within our toils, that they must not peep in[239] from outside, but simply sit still at their work, in silence.[240] Noble Philoitios, your task is to make fast the courtyard[241] door with the bolt, and tie the fastening quickly upon it.”[242] So he spoke, and went into the established palace,[243] and went back and sat in the chair from which he had risen,[244] and after him the two thralls of godlike Odysseus entered.[245] Eurymachos by now had taken the bow, and handled it,[246] turning it round and round by the blaze of the fire, but even[247] so he could not string it, and his proud heart was harrowed.[248] Deeply vexed he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:[249] “Oh, my sorrow. Here is a grief beyond all others;[250] it is not so much the marriage I grieve for, for all my chagrin.[251] There are many Achaian women besides, some of them close by[252] in seagirt Ithaka, and some in the rest of the cities;[253] but it is the thought, if this is true, that we come so far short[254] of godlike Odysseus in strength, so that we cannot even[255] string his bow. A shame for men unborn to be told of.”[256] Then in turn Antinoös, son of Eupeithes, answered:  p 511  [257] “It will not happen that way, Eurymachos. You yourself know this.[258] Now there is a holy feast in the community[259] for the god. Who could string bows then? Put it away now[260] for our good time; but we shall leave all the axes standing[261] where they are. I do not believe anyone will come in[262] and steal them away from the halls of Odysseus, son of Laertes.[263] Come, let the wine steward pour a round of wine in the goblets,[264] so we can make a libation and put away the curved bow;[265] then at dawn instruct Melanthios, who is the goatherd,[266] to bring in goats, those far the best in all of his goatflocks,[267] so that, dedicating the thighs to the glorious archer[268] Apollo, we can attempt the bow and finish the contest.”[269] So spoke Antinoös, and his word was pleasing to all of them.[270] The heralds poured water over their hands to wash with,[271] and the young men filled the mixing bowls with wine for their drinking,[272] and passed to all, after they had offered a drink in the goblets.[273] But when they had poured, and drunk, each as much as he wanted,[274] resourceful Odysseus spoke to them in crafty intention:[275] “Hear me now, you who are suitors of our glorious queen,[276] while I speak out what the heart within my breast urges.[277] Above all I entreat Eurymachos and the godlike[278] Antinoös, since what he said also was fair and orderly.[279] Let the bow be for the time, give it over to the divinities,[280] and tomorrow the god will give success to whomever he wishes;[281] but come now, give me the well-polished bow, so that among you[282] I may try out my strength and hands, to see if I still have[283] force in my flexible limbs as there has been in time past,[284] or whether my wandering and lack of good care have ruined me.”[285] So he spoke, but all of them were wildly indignant,[286] and feared that he might take the well-polished bow and string it.[287] Now Antinoös scolded him and spoke out and named him:[288] “Ah, wretched stranger, you have no sense, not even a little.[289] Is it not enough that you dine in peace, among us, who are violent[290] men, and are deprived of no pair portion, but listen[291] to our conversation and what we say? But there is no other[292] vagabond and newcomer who is allowed to hear us[293] talk. The honeyed wine has hurt you, as it has distracted[294] others as well, who gulp it down without drinking in season.[295] It was wine also that drove the Centaur, famour Eurytion,[296] distracted in the palace of great-hearted Peirithoös[297] when he visited the Lapiths. His brain went wild with drinking,[298] and in his fury he did much harm in the house of Peirithoös.[299] Grief and rage then seized the heroes, they sprang up and dragged him[300] through the forecourt and outside, with the pitiless bronze severing[301] his ears and nose; and he, having had his brains bewildered,[302] knew what a disaster his unstable spirit had got him.[303] Since his time there has been a feud between men and Centaurs,[304] and he was the first who found his own evil in heavy drinking.[305] So I announce great trouble for you as well, if ever[306] you string this bow; you will meet no kind of courtesy[307] in our group, but we shall put you into a black ship[308] and take you over to King Echetos, one who mutilates  p 512  [309] all men; there you will lose everything; sit and be quiet[310] and drink your wine, nor quarrel with men who are younger than you are.”[311] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[312] “Antinoös, it is neither fair nor just to browbeat[313] any guest of Telemachos who comes to visit him.[314] Do you imagine that if this stranger, in the confidence[315] of hands and strength, should string the great bow of Odysseus,[316] that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? No,[317] he himself has no such thought in the heart within him.[318] Let none of you be sorrowful at heart in his feasting[319] here, for such a reason. There is no likelihood of it.”[320] And now Eurymachos, the son of Polybos, answered:[321] “Daughter of Ikarios, circumspect Penelope,[322] we do not think he will take you away. That is not likely.[323] But we are ashamed to face the talk of the men and the women,[324] for fear some other Achaian, who is meaner than we are,[325] might say: ‘Far baser men are courting the wife of a stately[326] man. They are not even able to string his bow. Then[327] another, some beggar man, came wandering in from somewhere,[328] and easily strung the bow, and sent a shaft through the iron.’[329] So they will speak; and that would be a disgrace on all of us.”[330] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[331] “Eurymachos, there can be no glory among our people[332] in any case, for those who eat away and dishonor[333] the house of a great man. Why be concerned over reproaches?[334] But this stranger is a very big man, and he is built strongly,[335] and also he claims to be the son of a noble father.[336] Come then, give him the polished bow. Let us see what happens.[337] For I tell you this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished.[338] If he can string the bow, and Apollo gives him that glory,[339] I will give him fine clothing to wear, a mantle and tunic,[340] and give him a sharp javelin, to keep men and dogs off,[341] and give him sandals for his feet, a sword with two edges,[342] and send him wherever his heart and spirit desire to be sent.”[343] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to her in answer:[344] “My mother, no Achaian man has more authority[345] over this bow than I, to give or withhold, at my pleasure;[346] not one of those who are lords here in rocky Ithaka,[347] not one of those in the islands off horse-pasturing Elis;[348] no one can force me against my will; if I want, I can give it[349] to the stranger as an outright gift, to take away with him.[350] Go therefore back into the house, and take up your own work,[351] the loom and the distaff, and see to it that your handmaidens[352] ply their work also. The men shall have the bow in their keeping,[353] all men, but I most of all. For mine is the power in this household.”[354] Penelope went back inside the house, in amazement,[355] for she laid the serious words of her son deep away in her spirit;[356] and she went back to the upper story with her attendant[357] women, and wept for Odysseus, her beloved husband, until[358] gray-eyed Athene cast sweet slumber over her eyelids.[359] Now the noble swineherd took the curved bow and carried it;[360] but all the suitors in the palace cried out against him,  p 513  [361] and thus would go the word of one of these arrogant young men:[362] “Where are you carrying the bow, you sorry and shiftless[363] swineherd? Those swift dogs that you raised yourself will feed on you[364] beside your pigs, forsaken by men, if only Apollo[365] and the rest of the immortal gods are propitious toward us.”[366] They spoke, and he took the bow and put it back where it had been,[367] in fear, since many men were shouting at him in the palace,[368] but from the other side Telemachos spoke and threatened him:[369] “Keep on with the bow, old fellow. You cannot do what everyone[370] tells you. Take care, or, younger though I am, I might chase you[371] out to the fields with a shower of stones. I am stronger than you are.[372] I only wish I were as much stronger, and more of a fighter[373] with my hands, than all these suitors who are here in my household.[374] So I could hatefully speed any man of them on his journey[375] out of our house, where they are contriving evils against us.”[376] So he spoke, and all the suitors laughed happily at him,[377] and all gave over their bitter rage against Telemachos.[378] The swineherd took up the bow and carried it through the palace,[379] and stood beside the wise Odysseus, and handed it to him.[380] Then he called aside the nurse Eurykleia, and told her:[381] “Circumspect Eurykleia, Telemachos wants you[382] to bar the tightly fitted doors that close the house; and then,[383] if any of you hear from inside the crash and the outcry[384] of men who are caught within our toils, you must not peep in[385] from outside, but simply sit still at your work, in silence.”[386] So he spoke, and she had no winged words for an answer.[387] Eurykleia barred the doors of the strong-built great hall.[388] Philoitios sprang to his feet and went silently outside[389] the house, and then he closed the doors of the well-made courtyard.[390] Lying beneath the portico was a fiber cable[391] for an oar-driven ship; with that he made fast the doors, and himself[392] went in, and sat again on the chair from which he had risen,[393] looking toward Odysseus, who by now was handling the bow, turning it[394] all up and down, and testing it from one side and another[395] to see if worms had eaten the horn in the master’s absence.[396] And thus would one of them say as he looked across at the next man:[397] “This man is an admirer of bows, or one who steals them.[398] Now either he has such things lying back away in his own house,[399] or else he is studying to make one, the way he turns it[400] this way and that, our vagabond who is versed in villainies.”[401] And thus would speak another one of these arrogant young men:[402] “How I wish his share of good fortune were of the same measure[403] as is the degree of his power ever to get this bow strung.”[404] So the suitors talked, but now resourceful Odysseus,[405] once he had taken up the great bow and looked it all over,[406] as when a man, who well understands the lyre and singing,[407] easily, holding it on either side, pulls the strongly twisted[408] cord of sheep’s gut, so as to slip it over a new peg,[409] so, without any strain, Odysseus strung the great bow.[410] Then plucking it in his right hand he tested the bowstring,[411] and it gave him back an excellent sound like the voice of a swallow.[412] A great sorrow fell now upon the suitors, and all their color  p 514  [413] was changed, and Zeus showing forth his portents thundered mightily.[414] Hearing this, long-suffering great Odysseus was happy[415] that the son of devious-devising Kronos had sent him a portent.[416] He chose out a swift arrow that lay beside him uncovered[417] on the table, but the others were still stored up inside the hollow[418] quiver, and presently the Achaians must learn their nature.[419] Taking the string and the head grooves he drew to the middle[420] grip, and from the very chair where he sat, bending the bow[421] before him, let the arrow fly, nor missed any axes[422] from the first handle on, but the bronze-weighted arrow passed through[423] all, and out the other end. He spoke to Telemachos:[424] “Telemachos, your guest that sits in your halls does not then[425] fail you; I missed no part of the mark, nor have I made much[426] work of stringing the bow; the strength is still sound within me,[427] and not as the suitors said in their scorn, making little of me.[428] Now is the time for their dinner to be served the Achaians[429] in the daylight, then follow with other entertainment,[430] the dance and the lyre; for these things come at the end of the feasting.”[431] He spoke, and nodded to him with his brows, and Telemachos,[432] dear son of godlike Odysseus, put his sharp sword about him[433] and closed his own hand over his spear, and took his position[434] close beside him and next the chair, all armed in bright bronze.book twenty-two[1] Now resourceful Odysseus stripped his rags from him, and sprang[2] up atop the great threshold, holding his bow and the quiver[3] filled with arrows, and scattered out the swift shafts before him[4] on the ground next his feet, and spoke his word to the suitors:[5] “Here is a task that has been achieved, without any deception.[6] Now I shall shoot at another mark, one that no man yet[7] has struck, if I can hit it and Apollo grants me the glory.”[8] He spoke, and steered a bitter arrow against Antinoös.[9] He was on the point of lifting up a fine two-handled[10] goblet of gold, and had it in his hands, and was moving it[11] so as to drink of the wine, and in his heart there was no thought[12] of death. For who would think that one man, alone in a company[13] of many men at their feasting, though he were a very strong one,[14] would ever inflict death upon him and dark doom? But Odysseus,[15] aiming at this man, struck him in the throat with an arrow,[16] and clean through the soft part of the neck the point was driven.[17] He slumped away to one side, and out of his stricken hand fell[18] the goblet, and up and through his nostrils there burst a thick jet[19] of mortal blood, and with a thrust of his foot he kicked back[20] the table from him, so that all the good food was scattered[21] on the ground, bread and baked meats together; but all the suitors[22] clamored about the house when they saw that the man was fallen,[23] sprang up from their seats and ranged about the room, throwing[24] their glances every way all along the well-built walls,[25] but there was never a shield there nor any strong spear for them.[26] But they scolded Odysseus in words full of anger, saying:  p 515  [27] “Stranger, it is badly done to hit men. You will never[28] achieve any more trials. Now your sudden destruction is certain,[29] for now you have struck down the man who was far the greatest[30] of the youth of Ithaka. For that the vultures shall eat you.”[31] Each spoke at random, for they thought he had not intended[32] to kill the man, poor fools, and they had not yet realized[33] how over all of them the terms of death were now hanging.[34] But looking darkly upon them resourceful Odysseus answered:[35] “You dogs, you never thought that I would any more come back[36] from the land of Troy, and because of that you despoiled my household,[37] and forcibly took my serving women to sleep beside you,[38] and sought to win my wife while I was still alive, fearing[39] neither the immortal gods who hold the wide heaven,[40] nor any resentment sprung from men to be yours in the future.[41] Now upon all of you the terms of destruction are fastened.”[42] So he spoke, and the green fear took hold of all of them,[43] and each man looked about him for a way to escape sheer death.[44] Only Eurymachos spoke up and gave him an answer:[45] “If in truth you are Odysseus of Ithaka, come home,[46] what you have said is fair about all the wickedness done you[47] by the Achaians, much in your house and much in the country.[48] But now the man is down who was responsible for all[49] this, Antinoös. It was he who pushed this action,[50] not so much that he wanted the marriage, or cared for it,[51] but with other things in mind, which the son of Kronos would not[52] grant him: to lie in wait for your son and kill him, and then[53] be king himself in the district of strong-founded Ithaka.[54] Now he has perished by his own fate. Then spare your own[55] people, and afterward we will make public reparation[56] for all that has been eaten and drunk in your halls, setting[57] each upon himself an assessment of twenty oxen.[58] We will pay it back in bronze and gold to you, until your heart[59] is softened. Till then, we cannot blame you for being angry.”[60] Then looking darkly at him resourceful Odysseus answered:[61] “Eurymachos, if you gave me all your father’s possessions,[62] all that you have now, and what you could add from elsewhere,[63] even so, I would not stay my hands from the slaughter,[64] until I had taken revenge for all the suitors’ transgression.[65] Now the choice has been set before you, either to fight me[66] or run, if any of you can escape death and its spirits.[67] But I think not one man will escape from sheer destruction.”[68] So he spoke, and the others’ knees, and the heart within them,[69] went slack, but Eurymachos cried a second time, to the suitors:[70] “Dear friends, now this man will not restrain his invincible[71] hands, but since he has got the polished bow and the quiver,[72] he will shoot at us from the smooth threshold, until he has killed us[73] one and all. Then let us all remember out warcraft.[74] Draw your swords and hold the table before you, to ward off[75] the arrows of sudden death; let us all make a rush against him[76] together, and try to push him back from the doors and the threshold,[77] and go through the town. So the hue and cry could be most quickly[78] raised, and perhaps this man will now have shot for the last time.”  p 516  [79] So he spoke aloud, and drew from his side the sharp sword,[80] brazen, and edged on either side, and made a rush at him,[81] crying his terrible cry. At the same time, noble Odysseus[82] shot an arrow, and struck him in the chest, by the nipple,[83] and the speeding arrow fixed in his liver, and his sword tumbled[84] out of his hand on the floor, as he, sprawling over the table,[85] doubled and fell, and on the floor the good food was scattered,[86] and the two-handled goblet. He struck the ground with his forehead[87] in his paroxysm of pain, and kicking with both feet[88] rattled the chair, and over his eyes the death mist drifted.[89] Amphinomos, springing forward to face glorious Odysseus,[90] made a rush against him, and drew his sharp sword, thinking[91] he might be forced to give way from the doors; but now Telemachos[92] was too quick with a cast of the brazen spear from behind him[93] between the shoulders, and drove it through to the chest beyond it.[94] He fell, thunderously, and took the earth full on his forehead.[95] Telemachos sprang away, and left behind the far-shadowing[96] spear where it was in Amphinomos, turning back, for fear[97] that as he pulled out the far-shadowing spear, some other Achaian[98] might drive at him in an outrush, or else strike him from close up.[99] He went on the run, and very soon he reached his dear father,[100] and stood there close beside him and addressed him in winged words:[101] “Father, now I will go and bring you a shield, and two spears,[102] and a helmet all of bronze fitting close to your temples.[103] I too will go and put on armor, and give the swineherd[104] and oxherd more to wear. It is better for us to be armored.”[105] Then in turn resourceful Odysseus spoke to him in answer:[106] “Run and fetch them, while I have arrows still to defend me,[107] or else, while I am alone, they might force me from the doorway.”[108] So he spoke, and Telemachos obeyed his dear father,[109] and went on his way to the inner room, where glorious armor[110] was stored away, and took from inside four shields, and eight spears,[111] and four helmets plated with bronze and crested with horsehair,[112] and carried them back, and very soon he reached his dear father.[113] He was the first of all to put the bronze armor upon him,[114] and in the same way the two serving men put on their magnificent[115] arms, and stood beside the wise, resourceful Odysseus.[116] Odysseus, while he still had arrows left to defend him,[117] kept aiming at the suitors in his house; and every[118] time he hit his man, and they dropped one after another.[119] But when there were no more arrows left for the king’s archery,[120] he set the bow so it leaned against a pillar sustaining[121] the strong-built palace, there by the shining walls, then himself[122] threw across his shoulders the shield of the fourfold oxhide.[123] Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet,[124] with the horsehair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.[125] Then he caught up two powerful spears edged with the bright bronze.[126] There was a side door in the strongly-constructed wall, and also,[127] next the edge of the threshold into the well-made palace[128] a way through the alley, with the door leaves fitting it closely.[129] Odysseus told the noble swineherd to take a position[130] near this, and watch it. Only one at a time could attack there.  p 517  [131] Agelaos cried aloud to all of the suitors:[132] “Dear friends, could not one man slip away, through the side door,[133] and tell the people? So the hue and cry could be most quickly[134] raised, and perhaps this man will now have shot for the last time.”[135] Then in turn Melanthios the goatherd answered him:[136] “It cannot be, illustrious Agelaos. The fine doors[137] to the court are terribly close, the mouth of the alley is difficult[138] to force; one man could hold against all, if he were a fighter.[139] Come rather, let me bring you arms from inside the chamber[140] to arm you in; for there, I believe, and in no other[141] place, Odysseus and his glorious son have hidden them.”[142] So Melanthios the goatherd spoke, and climbed through[143] to Odysseus’ inner chambers by the vents in the great hall.[144] From there he took out a dozen heavy shields, and as many[145] spears, and as many brazen helmets crested with horsehair,[146] and went on his way, and quickly handed them to the suitors.[147] Then the knees of Odysseus went slack, and the heart within him,[148] as he saw them putting the armor about them, and shaking[149] the long spears in their hands; he thought it was monstrous[150] treason, and he spoke now in winged words to Telemachos:[151] “Telemachos, some of the women here in the palace,[152] or Melanthios, has made an evil attack upon us.”[153] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[154] “Father, it was my own mistake, and there is no other[155] to blame. I left the door of the chamber, which can close tightly,[156] open at an angle. One of these men was a better observer[157] than I. Go now, noble Eumaios, and close the chamber[158] door, and see if it is one of the women doing this,[159] or Melanthios, son of Dolios, which is what I think.”[160] Now as these two were conversing thus with each other,[161] Melanthios the goatherd went back into the chamber[162] to bring more splendid armor, but the noble swineherd sighted him.[163] Quickly he spoke a word to Odysseus standing close by him:[164] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[165] there is that deadly man again, the one we suspected,[166] on his way into the chamber. Now give me your true instructions,[167] whether, if I prove stronger than he is, I am to kill him,[168] or bring him back here to you, so he can pay for the many[169] transgressions, all that he has devised in your house against you.”[170] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[171] “Telemachos and I will hold off the haughty suitors,[172] for all their fury, here inside the palace; you two[173] twist the feet of Melanthios and his arms behind him,[174] put him away in the chamber and fasten boards behind him,[175] then make him secure with a braided rope, and hoist him upward[176] along the high column, till you fetch him up to the roof beams.[177] Thus, while he still stays alive, he will suffer harsh torment.”[178] So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him.[179] They went into the chamber. He was there, but he did not see them.[180] Now, he was searching out weapons, deep in the back of the chamber,[181] and they stood there waiting for him behind the columns, on either[182] side, until Melanthios the herdsman of goats came over  p 518  [183] the sill. In one hand he was holding a splendid helmet,[184] and in the other the ancient shield, all fouled with mildew,[185] of the hero Laertes, which he had carried when he was a young man.[186] It had been lying there, and the stitches were gone on the handstraps.[187] Now they sprang out and seized him, caught hold of his hair and dragged him[188] in, and threw him down on the floor, there in his anguish[189] of heart, and in the hurtful bond they securely fastened[190] his feet and arms, twisted all the way back, obeying the orders,[191] given by great, enduring Odysseus, the son of Laertes.[192] Then they made him secure with a braided rope, and hoisted him[193] high on the column, until they fetched him up to the roof beams.[194] Then you spoke and jeered at him, O swineherd Eumaios:[195] “Now the whole night long, Melanthios, you shall keep watch[196] wakefully, laid, as you deserve, to rest on a soft bed,[197] well aware of the young Dawn throned in gold as she rises[198] up from the Ocean rivers, at the time when you used to drive in[199] goats to the palace, so as to make a feast for the suitors.”[200] So they left him there, trussed up in his horrible bindings.[201] The herdsmen closed the shining door, and put on their armor,[202] and went and stood beside the wise, resourceful Odysseus.[203] There both sides stood, breathing valor, the four men holding[204] the threshold, but inside the house were many and brave men.[205] Now to these men came the daughter of Zeus, Athene,[206] likening herself in voice and appearance to Mentor.[207] Odysseus was happy when he saw her, and hailed her, saying:[208] “Mentor, help me from hurt, and remember me, your companion[209] and friend, who have done you much good. We two grew up together.”[210] He spoke so, but thought it was Athene, leader of armies.[211] On the other side in the palace the suitors cried out against her,[212] and first to threaten was Agelaos, son of Damastor;[213] “Mentor, never let Odysseus by talking persuade you[214] to fight against the suitors and defend him. Consider[215] what we propose to do, and I think it will be accomplished.[216] When we kill these men, the son and the father, you too[217] shall be killed in their company, for what you are trying[218] to do here in the palace. You shall pay for it with your own head.[219] But when with the bronze we have taken away the lives of all of you,[220] all the possessions which are yours, both here and elsewhere,[221] we shall count in with those of Odysseus, nor will we suffer[222] your sons to go on living here in your halls, nor your daughters[223] and loving wife to go about in the town of Ithaka.”[224] He spoke, and Athene in her heart grew still more angry,[225] and she scolded Odysseus in words full of anger, saying:[226] “No longer, Odysseus, are the strength and valor still steady[227] within you, as when, for the sake of white-armed, illustrious[228] Helen, you fought nine years with the Trojans, ever relentless;[229] and many men you killed there in the dreaded encounter,[230] and by your counsel the wide-wayed city of Priam was taken.[231] How is it now, when you have come back to your own possessions[232] and house, you complain, instead of standing up to the suitors?[233] Come here, friend, and watch me at work, and standing beside me  p 519  [234] see what kind of man is Mentor the son of Alkimos,[235] and how against your enemies he repays your kindness.”[236] She spoke, but did not yet altogether turn the victory[237] their way. She still was putting to proof the strength and courage[238] alike of Odysseus and his glorious son; and she now,[239] likening herself to a swallow in their sight, shot up[240] high aloft, and perched on a beam of the smoky palace.[241] Now Agelaos, son of Damastor, urged on the suitors,[242] with Demoptolemos, Amphimedon, and Peisandros[243] the son of Polyktor, Eurynomos, and the wise Polybos.[244] For these in warcraft were by far the best of the suitors[245] who still were alive and fighting for their lives; but others[246] had already fallen before the bow and the showering arrows.[247] To these Agelaos spoke, directing his words to all of them:[248] “Dear friends, now this man will have to stay his invincible[249] hands, since Mentor, after doing some empty boasting,[250] has gone, and these are left alone in the front doorway.[251] Now, do not all of you throw your long spears at the same time[252] at him, but let us six throw first with our spears, and it may be[253] Zeus will grant that we strike Odysseus and win the glory.[254] We care nothing about the others, once this man has fallen.”[255] So he spoke, and all six aimed their spears, as he told them,[256] and threw, but Athene made vain all their casts, so that[257] one man threw his spear against the pillar sustaining[258] the strong-built palace, another into the door, close-fitted.[259] One ash spear heavy with bronze was driven into the side wall.[260] But then, after they had avoided the spears of the suitors,[261] much-enduring great Odysseus began speaking to them:[262] “Dear friends, now I would say it was the time for our turn[263] to throw our spears into the midst of the suitors, furious[264] as they are to kill us, and add to former evils committed.”[265] So he spoke, and they all aimed their sharp spears and threw them[266] straight ahead. Demoptolemos was killed by Odysseus,[267] Euryades by Telemachos, Elatos by the swineherd,[268] Peisandros by Philoitios, the herdsman of oxen.[269] But when all these had fallen, and bit with their teeth the great earth,[270] the suitors drew away into the corner of the palace,[271] and the others rushed, and plucked their spears from the fallen bodies.[272] Once again the suitors aimed at them with their sharp spears,[273] and threw, but Athene made vain most of their casts, so that[274] one man threw his spear against the pillar sustaining[275] the strong-built palace, another into the door, close-fitted.[276] One ash spear heavy with bronze was driven into the side wall.[277] But Amphimedon struck Telemachos on the wrist, with a glancing[278] blow, and the bronze ripped the outermost skin; and also[279] Ktesippos with his long spear hit Eumaios over[280] the shield, and scratched his shoulder, but the spear flew over, and landed[281] void. Then the company of wise, devious-devising[282] Odysseus threw their spears into the mass of the suitors.[283] This time Odysseus, stormer of cities, struck down Eurydamas;[284] Telemachos hit Amphimedon; the swineherd, Polybos.[285] Then Philoitios, herdsman of oxen, struck Ktesippos  p 520  [286] full in the chest, and spoke a word of vaunting over him:[287] “O son of Polytherses, lover of mockery, never[288] speak loud and all at random in your recklessness. Rather[289] leave all speech to the gods, since they are far stronger than you are.[290] Here is your guest gift, in exchange for that hoof you formerly[291] gave to godlike Odysseus, as he went about through the palace.”[292] So spoke the herdsman of horn-curved oxen; but now Odysseus[293] stabbed Agelaos, son of Damastor, from close, with the long spear,[294] while Telemachos stabbed Leokritos, son of Euenor,[295] in the midmost belly with the spear, and drove the bronze clean through.[296] He fell then headlong, and took the earth full on his forehead.[297] And now Athene waved the aegis, that blights humanity,[298] from high aloft on the roof, and all their wits were bewildered;[299] and they stampeded about the hall, like a herd of cattle[300] set upon and driven wild by the darting horse fly[301] in the spring season, at the time when the days grow longer;[302] but the other men, who were like hook-clawed, beak-bent vultures,[303] descending from the mountains to pounce upon the lesser birds;[304] and these on the plain, shrinking away from the clouds, speed off,[305] but the vultures plunge on them and destroy them, nor is there any[306] defense, nor any escape, and men are glad for the hunting;[307] so these men, sweeping about the palace, struck down[308] the suitors, one man after another; the floor was smoking[309] with blood, and the horrible cries rose up as their heads were broken.[310] Leodes rushed in and caught the knees of Odysseus,[311] and spoke to him in winged words and in supplication:[312] “I am at your knees, Odysseus. Respect me, have mercy;[313] for I claim that never in your halls did I say or do anything[314] wrong to any one of the women, but always was trying[315] to stop any one of the other suitors who acted in that way.[316] But they would not listen to me and keep their hands off evil.[317] So by their own recklessness they have found a shameful[318] death, but I was their diviner, and I did nothing;[319] but I must fall, since there is no gratitude for past favors.”[320] Then looking darkly at him spoke resourceful Odysseus:[321] “If you claim to be the diviner among these people,[322] many a time you must have prayed in my palace, asking[323] that the completion of my sweet homecoming be far off[324] from me, that my dear wife would go off with you, and bear you[325] children. So you cannot escape from sorry destruction.”[326] So he spoke, and in his heavy hand caught up a sword[327] that was lying there on the ground where Agelaos had dropped it[328] when he was killed. With this he cut through the neck at the middle,[329] and the head of Leodes dropped in the dust while he was still speaking.[330] Phemios the singer, the son of Terpias, still was skulking[331] away from death. He had been singing among the suitors[332] under compulsion, and stood with the clear-toned lyre in his hands[333] by the side door, and his heart was pondering one of two courses:[334] either to slip out of the hall to the altar of mighty[335] Zeus of the court, and crouch at the structure, where once Odysseus[336] and Laertes had burned up the thighs of many oxen,[337] or rush up and make entreaty at the knees of Odysseus.  p 521  [338] Then in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[339] to seize hold of the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes.[340] Thereupon he laid the hollowed lyre on the ground,[341] between the mixing bowl and the chair with its nails of silver,[342] but he himself rushed in and caught the knees of Odysseus,[343] and spoke to him in winged words and in supplication:[344] “I am at your knees, Odysseus. Respect me, have mercy.[345] You will be sorry in time to come if you kill the singer[346] of songs. I sing to the gods and to human people, and I am[347] taught by myself, but the god has inspired in me the song-ways[348] of every kind. I am such a one as can sing before you[349] as to a god. Then do not be furious to behead me.[350] Telemachos too, your own dear son, would tell you, as I do,[351] that it was against my will, and with no desire on my part,[352] that I served the suitors here in your house and sang at their feasting.[353] They were too many and too strong, and they forced me to do it.”[354] So he spoke, and the hallowed prince Telemachos heard him.[355] Quickly then he spoke to his father, who stood close by him:[356] “Hold fast. Do not strike this man with the bronze. He is innocent.[357] And let us spare Medon our herald, a man who has always[358] taken care of me when I was a child in your palace;[359] unless, that is, Philoitios or the swineherd has killed him,[360] or unless he came in your way as you stormed through the palace.”[361] So he spoke, and Medon, a man of prudent thoughts, heard him;[362] for he had hidden under a chair, and put on about him[363] the hide of an ox, freshly skinned, so avoiding black death.[364] He came out quickly from under the chair, and took off the oxhide,[365] and then rushed in and caught hold of the knees of Telemachos,[366] and spoke to him in winged words and in supplication:[367] “Here I am, dear friend. Hold fast, and speak to your father,[368] before—since he is so strong—he destroys me with the tearing[369] bronze, in anger over the suitors, who kept ruining[370] his goods in his palace and, like fools, paid you no honor.”[371] Then resourceful Odysseus smiled upon him and answered:[372] “Do not fear. Telemachos has saved you and kept you[373] alive, so you may know in your heart, and say to another,[374] that good dealing is better by far than evil dealing.[375] But go out now from the palace and sit outside, away from[376] the slaughter, in the courtyard, you and the versatile singer,[377] so that I can do in the house the work that I have to.”[378] So he spoke, and the two went away, outside the palace,[379] and sat down both together beside the altar of mighty[380] Zeus, looking all about them, still thinking they would be murdered.[381] Odysseus looked about his own house, to see if any[382] man still was left alive, escaping the black destruction;[383] but he saw them, one and all in their numbers, lying fallen[384] in their blood and in the dust, like fish whom the fishermen[385] have taken in their net with many holes, and dragged out[386] onto the hollow beach from the gray sea, and all of them[387] lie piled on the sand, needing the restless salt water;[388] but Helios, the shining Sun, bakes the life out of them.[389] Like these, the suitors now were lying piled on each other.  p 522  [390] Then at last resourceful Odysseus said to Telemachos:[391] “Telemachos, come now, summon in the nurse, Eurykleia,[392] so that I can say what is on my mind to say to her.”[393] So he spoke, and Telemachos obeyed his dear father.[394] He opened the door and called out to the nurse, Eurykleia:[395] “Rise and come here, aged woman, you who watch over[396] all that the serving women do here in our palace.[397] Come here. My father calls you. He has something to tell you.”[398] So he spoke, and she had no winged words for an answer,[399] but she opened the doors of the strong-built great hall, and went[400] on inside, but Telemachos went ahead, leading her.[401] There she found Odysseus among the slaughtered dead men,[402] spattered over with gore and battle filth, like a lion[403] who has been feeding on an ox of the fields, and goes off[404] covered with blood, all his chest and his flanks on either[405] side bloody, a terrible thing to look in the face; so[406] now Odysseus’ feet and the hands above them were spattered.[407] She, when she saw the dead men and the endless blood, began then[408] to raise the cry of triumph, having seen it was monstrous[409] work, but Odysseus checked her and held her, for all her eagerness,[410] and spoke to her and addressed her in winged words, saying:[411] “Keep your joy in your heart, old dame; stop, do not raise up[412] the cry. It is not piety to glory so over slain men.[413] These were destroyed by the doom of the gods and their own hard actions,[414] for these men paid no attention at all to any man on earth[415] who came their way, no matter if he were base or noble.[416] So by their own recklessness they have found a shameful[417] death. Now assemble here the women who are in the palace,[418] both those who have done me no honor, and those who are innocent.”[419] Then the beloved nurse Eurykleia said to him in answer:[420] “So, my child, I will tell you the whole truth of the matter.[421] You have fifty serving women here in your palace,[422] and these I have taught to work at their own tasks, the carding[423] of wool, and how to endure their own slavery. Of these[424] fifty, twelve in all have taken to immorality.[425] They pay no attention to me, or even to Penelope.[426] Telemachos is but lately come of age, and his mother[427] would not let him be in charge of the serving women.[428] But come, let me go up to the shining upper chamber[429] and tell your wife. Some god has sent down a sleep upon her.”[430] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[431] “Do not waken her yet, but tell those women who have been[432] shameful in their devisings to come here to my presence.”[433] So he spoke, and the old woman went through the palace,[434] bringing the message to the women and urging them onward.[435] But Odysseus, calling Telemachos and the oxherd[436] and swineherd to him, spoke to them in winged words, saying:[437] “Begin the work of carrying out the bodies, and tell[438] the women to help, and after that to wash the beautiful[439] chairs and tables clean, with water and porous sponges.[440] Then, after you have got all the house back in good order,[441] lead all these maidservants out of the well-built palace  p 523  [442] between the round-house and the unfaulted wall of the courtyard,[443] and hew them with the thin edge of the sword, until you have taken[444] the lives from all, and they forget Aphrodite, the goddess[445] they had with them when they lay secretly with the suitors.”[446] So he spoke, and the women all in a huddle came out,[447] with terrible cries of sorrow, and the big tears falling.[448] First they carried away the bodies of all the dead men,[449] and laid them under the portico of the well-built courtyard,[450] stacking them on each other. Odysseus himself directed them[451] and hurried them on. They carried the bodies out. They had to.[452] Then, after they had done this, the women washed the beautiful[453] chairs and tables clean, with water and porous sponges.[454] After this Telemachos, the oxherd and the swineherd,[455] scraped out the floor of the strongly constructed house, with shovels,[456] and the women carried the scrapings way, and piled them outside.[457] But after they had got all the house back in good order,[458] leading the maidservants out of the well-built palace,[459] between the round-house and the unfaulted wall of the courtyard,[460] they penned them in a strait place from which there was no escaping.[461] Now the thoughtful Telemachos began speaking among them:[462] “I would not take away the lives of these creatures by any[463] clean death, for they have showered abuse on the head of my mother,[464] and on my own head too, and they have slept with the suitors.”[465] So he spoke, and taking the cable of a dark-prowed ship,[466] fastened it to the tall pillar, and fetched it about the round-house;[467] and like thrushes, who spread their wings, or pigeons, who have[468] flown into a snare set up for them in a thicket, trying[469] to find a resting place, but the sleep given them was hateful;[470] so their heads were all in a line, and each had her neck caught[471] fast in a noose, so that their death would be most pitiful.[472] They struggled with their feet for a little, not for very long.[473] They took Melanthios along the porch and the courtyard.[474] They cut off, with the pitiless bronze, his nose and his ears,[475] tore off his private parts and gave them to the dogs to feed on[476] raw, and lopped off his hands and feet, in fury of anger.[477] Then, after they had washed their own hands and feet clean,[478] they went into the house of Odysseus. Their work was ended.[479] But Odysseus said to the beloved nurse, Eurykleia:“Bring me brimstone, old dame, the cure of evils, and bring mefire, so I can sulphur the hall, and tell Penelopeto come here now, together with her attendant women,and tell all the serving maids to come here to the palace.”[485] Then the beloved nurse Eurykleia said to him in answer:[486] “All this you have said, my child, was fair and orderly.[487] But come now, let me bring you out a mantle and tunic,[488] and do not stand thus here in the hall, with your broad shoulders[489] covered over with rags as they are. That would be scandalous.”[490] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered her:[491] “Before all this, let me have the fire in my palace.”[492] He spoke, and the dear nurse Eurykleia did not disobey him.[493] She brought him out the fire and brimstone; and then Odysseus[494] cleaned his palace, house and courtyard alike, with sulphur.[495] The old woman went off through the fine house of Odysseus,  p 524  [496] to take the message to the women and tell them to gather.[497] They came from the main house, and in their hands held torches,[498] and all the serving women clung to Odysseus, and greeted him,[499] and made much of him, and kissed him on his head and his shoulders[500] and hands, admiring him, and sweet longing for lamentation[501] and tears took hold of him. He recognized all these women.book twenty-three[1] The old woman, laughing loudly, went to the upper chamber[2] to tell her mistress that her beloved husband was inside[3] the house. Her knees moved swiftly, but her feet were tottering.[4] She stood above Penelope’s head and spoke a word to her:[5] “Wake, Penelope, dear child, so that, with your own eyes,[6] you can see what all your days you have been longing for.[7] Odysseus is here, he is in the house, though late in his coming;[8] and he has killed the haughty suitors, who were afflicting[9] his house, and using force on his son, and eating his property.”[10] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[11] “Dear nurse, the gods have driven you crazy. They are both able[12] to change a very sensible person into a senseless[13] one, and to set the light-wit on the way of discretion.[14] They have set you awry; before now your thoughts were orderly.[15] Why do you insult me when my heart is heavy with sorrows,[16] by talking in this wild way, and waking me from a happy[17] sleep, which had come and covered my eyes, and held them fastened?[18] For I have not had such a sleep as this one, since the time[19] when Odysseus went to that evil, not-to-be-mentioned Ilion.[20] But go down now, and take yourself back into the palace.[21] If any of those other women, who are here with me,[22] had come with a message like yours, and wakened me from my slumber,[23] I would have sent her back on her way to the hall in a hateful[24] fashion for doing it. It shall be your age that saves you.”[25] Then the beloved nurse Eurykleia said to her in answer:[26] “I am not insulting you, dear child. It is all true.[27] Odysseus is here, he is in the house, just as I tell you.[28] He is that stranger-guest, whom all in the house were abusing.[29] Telemachos has known that he was here for a long time,[30] but he was discreet, and did not betray the plans of his father,[31] so he might punish these overbearing men for their violence.”[32] So she spoke, and Penelope in her joy sprang up[33] from the bed, and embraced the old woman, her eyes streaming[34] tears, and she spoke to her and addressed her in winged words:[35] “Come, dear nurse, and give me a true account of the matter,[36] whether he really has come back to his house, as you tell me,[37] to lay his hands on the shameless suitors, though he was only[38] one, and they were always lying in wait, in a body!”[39] Then the beloved nurse Eurykleia said to her in answer:[40] “I did not see, I was not told, but I heard the outcry[41] of them being killed; we, hidden away in the strong-build storerooms,[42] sat there terrified, and the closed doors held us prisoner,  p 525  [43] until from inside the great hall your son Telemachos[44] summoned me, because his father told him to do it.[45] There I found Odysseus standing among the dead men[46] he had killed, and they covered the hardened earth, lying[47] piled on each other around him. You would have been cheered to see him,[48] spattered over with gore and battle filth, like a lion.[49] Now they lie all together, by the doors of the courtyard,[50] while he is burning a great fire, and cleaning the beautiful[51] house with brimstone. He has sent me on to summon you.[52] Come with me then, so that both of you can turn your dear hearts[53] the way of happiness, since you have had so much to suffer,[54] but now at last what long you prayed for has been accomplished.[55] He has come back and is here at his hearth, alive, and has found you[56] and his son in the palace, and has taken revenge on the suitors[57] here in his house, for all the evils that they have done him.”[58] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[59] “Dear nurse, do not yet laugh aloud in triumph. You know[60] how welcome he would be if he appeared in the palace:[61] to all, but above all to me and the son we gave birth to.[62] No, but this story is not true as you tell it; rather,[63] some one of the immortals has killed the haughty suitors[64] in anger over their wicked deeds and heart-hurting violence;[65] for these men paid no attention at all to any man on earth[66] who came their way, no matter if he were base or noble.[67] So they suffered for their own recklessness. But Odysseus[68] has lost his homecoming and lost his life, far from Achaia.”[69] Then the beloved nurse Eurykleia said to her in answer:[70] “My child, what sort of word escaped your teeth’s barrier?[71] Though your husband is here beside the hearth, you would never[72] say he would come home. Your heart was always mistrustful.[73] But here is another proof that is very clear. I will tell you.[74] That scar, which once the boar with his white teeth inflicted.[75] I recognized it while I was washing his feet, and I wanted[76] to tell you about it, but he stopped my mouth with his hands, would not[77] let me speak, for his mind sought every advantage. Come then,[78] follow me, and I will hazard my life upon it.[79] Kill me by the most pitiful death, if I am deceiving you.”[80] Circumspect Penelope said to her in answer:[81] “Dear nurse, it would be hard for you to baffle the purposes[82] of the everlasting gods, although you are very clever.[83] Still, I will go to see my son, so that I can look on[84] these men who courted me lying dead, and the man who killed them.”[85] She spoke, and came down from the chamber, her heart pondering[86] much, whether to keep away and question her dear husband,[87] or to go up to him and kiss his head, taking his hands.[88] But then, when she came in and stepped over the stone threshold,[89] she sat across from him in the firelight, facing Odysseus,[90] by the opposite wall, while he was seated by the tall pillar,[91] looking downward, and waiting to find out if his majestic[92] wife would have anything to say to him, now that she saw him.[93] She sat a long time in silence, and her heart was wondering.[94] Sometimes she would look at him, with her eyes full upon him,  p 526  [95] and again would fail to know him in the foul clothing he wore.[96] Telemachos spoke to her and called her by name and scolded her:[97] “My mother, my harsh mother with the hard heart inside you,[98] why do you withdraw so from my father, and do not[99] sit beside him and ask him questions and find out about him?[100] No other woman, with spirit as stubborn as yours, would keep back[101] as you are doing from her husband who, after much suffering,[102] came at last in the twentieth year back to his own country.[103] But always you have a heart that is harder than stone within you.”[104] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[105] “My child, the spirit that is in me is full of wonderment,[106] and I cannot find anything to say to him, nor question him,[107] nor look him straight in the face. But if he is truly Odysseus,[108] and he has come home, then we shall find other ways, and better,[109] to recognize each other, for we have signs that we know of[110] between the two of us only, but they are secret from others.”[111] So she spoke, and much-enduring noble Odysseus[112] smiled, and presently spoke in winged words to Telemachos:[113] “Telemachos, leave your mother to examine me in the palace[114] as she will, and presently she will understand better;[115] but now that I am dirty and wear foul clothing upon me,[116] she dislikes me for that, and says I am not her husband.[117] But let us make our plans how all will come out best for us.[118] For when one has killed only one man in a community,[119] and then there are not many avengers to follow, even[120] so, he flees into exile, leaving kinsmen and country.[121] But we have killed what held the city together, the finest[122] young men in Ithaka. It is what I would have you consider.”[123] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[124] “You must look to this yourself, dear father; for they say[125] you have the best mind among men for craft, and there is[126] no other man among mortal men who can contend with you.[127] We shall follow you eagerly; I think that we shall not[128] come short in warcraft, in so far as the strength stays with us.”[129] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[130] “So I will tell you the way of it, how it seems best to me.[131] First, all go and wash, and put your tunics upon you,[132] and tell the women in the palace to choose out their clothing.[133] Then let the inspired singer take his clear-sounding lyre,[134] and give us the lead for festive dance, so that anyone[135] who is outside, some one of the neighbors, or a person going[136] along the street, who hears us, will think we are having a wedding.[137] Let no rumor go abroad in the town that the suitors[138] have been murdered, until such time as we can make our way[139] out to our estate with its many trees, and once there[140] see what profitable plan the Olympian shows us.”[141] So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him.[142] First they went and washed, and put their tunics upon them,[143] and the women arrayed themselves in their finery, while the inspired[144] singer took up his hollowed lyre and stirred up within them[145] the impulse for the sweetness of song and the stately dancing.[146] Now the great house resounded aloud to the thud of their footsteps,  p 527  [147] as the men celebrated there, and fair-girdled women;[148] and thus would a person speak outside the house who heard them:[149] “Surely now someone has married our much-sought-after[150] queen; hard-hearted, she had no patience to keep the great house[151] for her own wedded lord to the end, till he came back to her.”[152] So would a person speak, but they did not know what had happened.[153] Now the housekeeper Eurynome bathed great-hearted[154] Odysseus in his own house, and anointed him with olive oil,[155] and threw a beautiful mantle and a tunic about him;[156] and over his head Athene suffused great beauty, to make him[157] taller to behold and thicker, and on his head she arranged[158] the curling locks that hung down like hyacinthine petals.[159] And as when a master craftsman overlays gold on silver,[160] and he is one who was taught by Hephaistos and Pallas Athene[161] in art complete, and grace is on every work he finishes;[162] so Athene gilded with grace his head and his shoulders.[163] Then, looking like an immortal, he strode forth from the bath,[164] and came back then and sat on the chair from which he had risen,[165] opposite his wife, and now he spoke to her, saying:[166] “You are so strange. The gods, who have their homes on Olympos,[167] have made your heart more stubborn than for the rest of womankind.[168] No other woman, with spirit as stubborn as yours, would keep back[169] as you are doing from her husband who, after much suffering,[170] came at last in the twentieth year back to his own country.[171] Come then, nurse, make me up a bed, so that I can use it[172] here; for this woman has a heart of iron within her.”[173] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[174] “You are so strange. I am not being proud, nor indifferent,[175] nor puzzled beyond need, but I know very well what you looked like[176] when you went in the ship with the sweeping oars, from Ithaka.[177] Come then, Eurykleia, and make up a firm bed for him[178] outside the well-fashioned chamber: that very bed that he himself[179] built. Put the firm bed here outside for him, and cover it[180] over with fleeces and blankets, and with shining coverlets.”[181] So she spoke to her husband, trying him out, but Odysseus[182] spoke in anger to his virtuous-minded lady:[183] “What you have said, dear lady, has hurt my heart deeply. What man[184] has put my bed in another place? But it would be difficult[185] for even a very expert one, unless a god, coming[186] to help in person, were easily to change its position.[187] But there is no mortal man alive, no strong man, who lightly[188] could move the weight elsewhere. There is one particular feature[189] in the bed’s construction. I myself, no other man, made it.[190] There was the bole of an olive tree with long leaves growing[191] strongly in the courtyard, and it was thick, like a column.[192] I laid down my chamber around this, and built it, until I[193] finished it, with close-set stones, and roofed it well over,[194] and added the compacted doors, fitting closely together.[195] Then I cut away the foliage of the long-leaved olive,[196] and trimmed the trunk from the roots up, planing it with a brazen[197] adze, well and expertly, and trued it straight to a chalkline,[198] making a bed post of it, and bored all holes with an auger.  p 528  [199] I began with this and built my bed, until it was finished,[200] and decorated it with gold and silver and ivory.[201] Then I lashed it with thongs of oxhide, dyed bright with purple.[202] There is its character, as I tell you; but I do not know now,[203] dear lady, whether my bed is still in place, or if some man[204] has cut underneath the stump of the olive, and moved it elsewhere.”[205] So he spoke, and her knees and the heart within her went slack[206] as she recognized the clear proofs that Odysseus had given;[207] but then she burst into tears and ran straight to him, throwing[208] her arms around the neck of Odysseus, and kissed his head, saying:[209] “Do not be angry with me, Odysseus, since, beyond other men,[210] you have the most understanding. The gods granted us misery,[211] in jealousy over the thought that we two, always together,[212] should enjoy our youth, and then come to the threshold of old age.[213] Then do not now be angry with me nor blame me, because[214] I did not greet you, as I do now, at first when I saw you.[215] For always the spirit deep in my very heart was fearful[216] that some one of mortal men would come my way and deceive me[217] with words. For there are many who scheme for wicked advantage.[218] For neither would the daughter born to Zeus, Helen of Argos,[219] have lain in love with an outlander from another country,[220] if she had known that the warlike sons of the Achaians would bring her[221] home again to the beloved land of her fathers.[222] It was a god who stirred her to do the shameful thing she[223] did, and never before had she had in her heart this terrible[224] wildness, out of which came suffering to us also.[225] But now, since you have given me accurate proof describing[226] our bed, which no other mortal man beside has ever seen,[227] but only you and I, and there is one serving woman,[228] Aktor’s daughter, whom my father gave me when I came here,[229] who used to guard the doors for us in our well-built chamber;[230] so you persuade my heart, though it has been very stubborn.”[231] She spoke, and still more roused in him the passion for weeping.[232] He wept as he held his lovely wife, whose thoughts were virtuous.[233] And as when the land appears welcome to men who are swimming,[234] after Poseidon has smashed their strong-built ship on the open[235] water, pounding it with the weight of wind and the heavy[236] seas, and only a few escape the gray water landward[237] by swimming, with a thick scurf of salt coated upon them,[238] and gladly they set foot on the shore, escaping the evil;[239] so welcome was her husband to her as she looked upon him,[240] and she could not let him go from the embrace of her white arms.[241] Now Dawn of the rosy fingers would have dawned on their weeping,[242] had not the gray-eyed goddess Athene planned it otherwise.[243] She held the long night back at the outward edge, she detained[244] Dawn of the golden throne by the Ocean, and would not let her[245] harness her fast-footed horses who bring the daylight to people:[246] Lampos and Phaeton, the Dawn’s horses, who carry her.[247] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke to his wife, saying:[248] “Dear wife, we have not yet come to the limit of all our[249] trials. There is unmeasured labor left for the future,[250] both difficult and great, and all of it I must accomplish.  p 529  [251] So the soul of Teiresias prophesied to me, on that day[252] when I went down inside the house of Hades, seeking[253] to learn about homecoming, for myself and for my companions.[254] But come, my wife, let us go to bed, so that at long last[255] we can enjoy the sweetness of slumber, sleeping together.”[256] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[257] “You shall have your going to bed whenever the spirit[258] desires it, now that the gods have brought about your homecoming[259] to your own strong-founded house and to the land of your fathers.[260] But since the gods put this into your mind and you understand it,[261] tell me what this trial is, since I think I shall hear of it[262] later; so it will be none the worse if I now hear of it.”[263] Then in turn resourceful Odysseus said it to her in answer:[264] “You are so strange. Why do you urge me on and tell me[265] to speak of it? Yet I will tell you, concealing nothing.[266] Your heart will have no joy in this; and I myself am not[267] happy, since he told me to go among many cities[268] of men, taking my well-shaped oar in my hands and bearing it,[269] until I come where there are men living who know nothing[270] of the sea, and who eat food that is not mixed with salt, who never[271] have known ships whose cheeks are painted purple, who never[272] have known well-shaped oars, which act for ships as wings do.[273] And then he told me a very clear proof. I will not conceal it.[274] When, as I walk, some other wayfarer happens to meet me,[275] and says I carry a winnow fan on my bright shoulder,[276] then I must plant my well-shaped oar in the ground, and render[277] ceremonious sacrifice to the lord Poseidon,[278] one ram and one bull, and a mounter of sows, a boar pig,[279] and make my way home again, and render holy hecatombs[280] to the immortal gods who hold the wide heaven, all[281] of them in order. Death will come to me from the sea, in[282] some altogether unwarlike way, and it will end me[283] in the ebbing time of a sleek old age. My people[284] about me will prosper. All this he told me would be accomplished.”[285] Circumspect Penelope said to him in answer:[286] “If the gods are accomplishing a more prosperous old age,[287] then there is hope that you shall have an escape from your troubles.”[288] Now as these two were conversing thus with each other,[289] meanwhile the nurse and Eurynome were making the bed up[290] with soft coverings, under the light of their flaring torches.[291] Then when they had worked and presently had a firm bed made,[292] the old woman went away back to bed in her own place,[293] while Eurynome, as mistress of the chamber, guided them[294] on their way to the bed, and her hands held the torch for them.[295] When she had brought them to the chamber she went back. They then[296] gladly went together to bed, and their old ritual.[297] At this time Telemachos and the oxherd and swineherd[298] stopped the beat of their feet in the dance, and stopped the women,[299] and they themselves went to bed in the shadowy palace.[300] When Penelope and Odysseus had enjoyed their lovemaking,[301] they took their pleasure in talking, each one telling his story.[302] She, shining among women, told of all she had endured  p 530  [303] in the palace, as she watched the suitors, a ravening company,[304] who on her account were slaughtering many oxen[305] and fat sheep, and much wine was being drawn from the wine jars.[306] But shining Odysseus told of all the cares he inflicted[307] on other men, and told too of all that in his misery[308] he had toiled through, She listened to him with delight, nor did any[309] sleep fall upon her eyes until he had told her everything.[310] He began with how he had beaten the Kikonians, and then[311] gone to the rich country of the men who feed on the lotus.[312] He told all that the Cyclops had done, and how he took vengeance[313] on him for his strong companions he had eaten, and showed no pity.[314] How he came to Aiolos, who generously received him[315] and gave him passage, but it was not fated for him to come back[316] yet to his country, so the stormwinds caught and carried him[317] out again on the sea where the fish swarm, groaning heavily;[318] and how he came to Telepylos of the Laistrygones,[319] and these men had destroyed his ships and strong greaved companions[320] [all; but Odysseus only got away with his black ship].[321] He told her of the guile and the many devices of Circe,[322] and how he had gone into the mouldering home of Hades,[323] there to consult the soul of Theban Teiresias, going[324] in his ship with many benches, and there saw all his companions,[325] and his mother, who had borne him and nursed him when he was little.[326] He told how he had heard the song of the echoing Sirens,[327] and made his way to the Roving Rocks and dreaded Charybdis[328] and Skylla, whom no men ever yet have escaped without damage.[329] He told how his companions ate the cattle of Helios,[330] then told how Zeus who thunders on high had struck his fast ship[331] with the smoky thunderbolt, and all his noble companions[332] perished alike, only he escaped the evil death spirits;[333] and how he came to the island Ogygia and the nymph Kalypso[334] who detained him with her, desiring that he should be her husband,[335] in her hollow caverns, and she took care of him and told him[336] that she would make him ageless all his days, and immortal,[337] but never so could she persuade the heart that was in him;[338] then how, after much suffering, he reached the Phaiakians,[339] who honored him in their hearts as if he were a god, and sent him[340] back, by ship, to the beloved land of his fathers,[341] bestowing bronze and gold in abundance on him, and clothing.[342] And this was the last word he spoke to her, when the sweet sleep[343] came to relax his limbs and slip the cares from his spirit.[344] Then the goddess gray-eyed Athene thought what to do next.[345] As soon as she thought the heart of Odysseus had full contentment[346] of the pleasure of resting in bed beside his wife, and of sleeping,[347] immediately she stirred from Ocean the golden-throned early[348] Dawn, to shine her light upon men, and Odysseus rose up[349] from his soft bed, and spoke then to his wife, telling her:[350] “Dear wife, we both have had our full share of numerous trials[351] now; yours have been here as you cried over my much-longed-for[352] homecoming, while as for me, Zeus and the other gods held me[353] back from my own country, as I was striving to reach it.[354] But now that we two have come to our desired bed together,  p 531  [355] you look after my possessions which are in the palace,[356] but as for my flocks, which the overbearing suitors have ruined,[357] many I shall restore by raiding, others the Achaians[358] shall give me, until they have filled up all of my sheepfolds.[359] But now I shall go to our estate with its many orchards,[360] to see my noble father who has grieved for me constantly.[361] But I tell you this, my wife, though you have your own understanding.[362] Presently, when the sun rises, there will be a rumor[363] about the men who courted you, whom I killed in our palace.[364] Then go to the upper chamber with your attendant women,[365] and sit still, looking at no one, and do not ask any questions.”[366] He spoke, and put his splendid armor over his shoulders,[367] and wakened Telemachos and the oxherd and the swineherd,[368] and told all to take up in their hands their warlike weapons;[369] nor did they disobey him, but armed themselves in the bronze, then[370] opened the doors and went outside, and Odysseus led them.[371] By now the light was over the earth, but Athene, hiding[372] these men in darkness, guided them quickly out of the city.book twenty-four[1] Hermes of Kyllene summoned the souls of the suitors[2] to come forth, and in his hands he was holding the beautiful[3] golden staff, with which he mazes the eyes of those mortals[4] whose eyes he would maze, or wakes again the sleepers. Herding[5] them on with this, he led them along, and they followed, gibbering.[6] And as when bats in the depth of an awful cave flitter[7] and gibber, when one of them has fallen out of his place in[8] the chain that the bats have formed by holding one on another;[9] so, gibbering, they went their way together, and Hermes[10] the kindly healer led them along down moldering pathways.[11] They went along, and passed the Ocean stream, and the White Rock,[12] and passed the gates of Helios the Sun, and the country[13] of dreams, and presently arrived in the meadow of asphodel.[14] This is the dwelling place of souls, images of dead men.[15] There they found the soul of Achilleus, the son of Peleus,[16] the soul of Patroklos, and the soul of stately Antilochos,[17] and the soul of Aias, who for beauty and stature was greatest[18] of all the Danaans, next to the blameless son of Peleus.[19] So these were gathered around Achilleus, and now came to them[20] the soul of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, sorrowing,[21] and around him were gathered the souls of those others, who with him[22] also died and met their fate in the house of Aigisthos.[23] First of these two to speak was the soul of the son of Peleus:[24] “Son of Atreus, we thought that all your days you were favored[25] beyond all other heroes by Zeus who delights in the thunder,[26] because you were lord over numerous people, and strong ones,[27] in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaians suffered hardships.[28] And yet it was to you that the destructive doom spirit[29] would come too early; but no man who is born escapes her.[30] How I wish that, enjoying that high place of your power,  p 532  [31] you could have met death and destiny in the land of the Trojans.[32] So all the Achaians would have made a mound to cover you,[33] and you would have won great glory for your son hereafter.[34] In truth you were ordained to die by a death most pitiful.”[35] The soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, answered:[36] “O happy son of Peleus, Achilleus, like the immortals,[37] who died in Troy, far away from Argos, and around you others[38] were killed, Trojans and the best men among the Achaians,[39] as they fought over you; and you in the turning dust lay[40] mightily in your might, your horsemanship all forgotten.[41] We fought on for the whole day long, nor would we ever[42] have stopped fighting, if Zeus had not stopped us with a whirlstorm.[43] But when we had carried you to the ships, away from the fighting,[44] we laid you out on a litter, and anointed your handsome body[45] with warm water and with unguents, and by you the Danaans[46] shed many hot tears, and cut their hair short for you; and also[47] your mother, hearing the news, came out of the sea, with immortal[48] sea girls beside her. Immortal crying arose and spread over[49] the great sea, and trembling seized hold of all the Achaians.[50] And now they would have started away, and gone on the hollow[51] ships, had not a man of much ancient wisdom halted them,[52] Nestor, whose advice had also shown best before this.[53] He in kind intention toward all spoke forth and addressed them:[54] “Hold fast, Argives; do not run away, O young Achaians.[55] It is his mother coming out of the sea with immortal[56] sea girls beside her, to be with her son, who has perished.”[57] So he spoke, and the great-hearted Achaians stayed from[58] their panic. Around you stood the daughters of the Sea’s Ancient,[59] mourning piteously, with immortal clothing upon them.[60] And all the nine Muses in sweet antiphonal singing[61] mourned you, nor would you then have seen any one of the Argives[62] not in tears, so much did the singing Muse stir them.[63] For ten and seven days, alike in the day and the night time,[64] we wailed for you, both mortal people and the immortals.[65] On the eighteenth day we gave you to the fire, and around you[66] slaughtered a great number of fat sheep and horn-curved cattle.[67] You were burned in the clothing of the gods, and abundant[68] ointment and sweet honey, while many Achaian heroes[69] moved in armor about the prye where you were burning,[70] with horses and on foot, and a great clamoring rose up.[71] But after the flame of Hephaistos had consumed you utterly,[72] then at dawn we gathered your white bones, Achilleus,[73] together with unmixed wine and unguents. Your mother gave you[74] a golden jar with handles. She said that it was a present[75] from Dionysos, and was the work of renowned Hephaistos.[76] In this your white bones are laid away, O shining Achilleus,[77] mixed with the bones of the dead Patroklos, son of Menoitios,[78] and apart from those of Antilochos, whom you prized above all[79] the rest of your companions after the death of Patroklos.[80] Around them then, we, the chosen host of the Argive[81] spearmen, piled up a grave mound that was both great and perfect,[82] on a jutting promontory there by the wide Hellespont,  p 533  [83] so that it can be seen afar from out on the water[84] by men now alive and those to be born in the future.[85] Then your mother, asking the gods for the gift of beautiful[86] prizes, set them in the field for the best of the Achaians.[87] I in my time have attended the funerals of many[88] heroes, at those times when, because a king has perished,[89] the young men gird themselves for sport and set up the prizes;[90] but these your heart would have admired beyond any others,[91] such beautiful prizes as were set up by the goddess, silver-footed[92] Thetis, for your sake. You were very dear to the gods. So,[93] even now you have died, you have not lost your name, but always[94] in the sight of all mankind your fame shall be great, Achilleus;[95] but what pleasure was there for me when I had wound up the fighting?[96] In my homecoming Zeus devised my dismal destruction,[97] to be killed by the hands of my cursed wife, and Aigisthos.”[98] Now as the spirits were conversing thus with each other,[99] there came approaching them the courier Argeïphontes,[100] leading down the souls of the suitors killed by Odysseus.[101] These two in wonderment went up to them as they saw them,[102] and the soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, recognized[103] glorious Amphimedon, the dear son of Melaneus,[104] who, in his home in Ithaka, had once been his guest-friend.[105] First of the two to speak was the soul of Agamemnon:[106] “Amphimedon, what befell you that you came under the dark earth,[107] all of you choice young men, of the same age, nor could one, gathering[108] the best men out of all a city have chosen otherwise.[109] Was it with the ships, and did Poseidon, rousing a stormblast[110] of battering winds and waves towering prove your undoing?[111] Or was it on the dry land, did men embattled destroy you[112] as you tried to cut out cattle and fleecy sheep from their holdings,[113] or fighting against them, for the sake of their city and women?[114] Tell me what I ask. I claim that I am your guest-friend.[115] Or do you not remember when I came into your house there,[116] together with godlike Menelaos, to rouse up Odysseus[117] so he would go to Ilion on the well-benched vessels[118] with us? And we were a whole month crossing over the wide sea,[119] having hardly persuaded Odysseus, sacker of cities.”[120] Then in turn the soul of Amphimedon answered him, saying:[121] “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,[122] I remember it all, illustrious, as you tell it.[123] I will tell you well and truthfully the entire story[124] of how our wretched end came in death, how it was accomplished.[125] We were courting the wife of Odysseus, who had been long gone.[126] She would not refuse the hateful marriage, nor would she bring it[127] about, but she was planning our death and black destruction[128] with this other stratagem of her heart’s devising.[129] She set up a great loom in her palace, and set to weaving[130] a web of threads long and fine. Then she said to us:[131] ‘Young men, my suitors now that the great Odysseus has perished,[132] wait, though you are eager to marry me, until I finish[133] this web, so that my weaving will not be useless and wasted.[134] This is a shroud for the hero Laertes, for when the destructive  p 534  [135] doom of death, which lays men low, shall take him, lest any[136] Achaian woman in this neighborhood hold it against me[137] that a man of many conquests lies with no sheet to wind him.’[138] So she spoke, and the proud heart in us was persuaded.[139] Thereafter in the daytime she would weave at her great loom,[140] but in the night she would have torches set by, and undo it.[141] So for three years she was secret in her design, convincing[142] the Achaians, but when the fourth year came, with the seasons returning,[143] and the months waned, and many days had been brought to completion,[144] one of her women, who knew the whole of the story, told us,[145] and we found her in the act of undoing her glorious weaving.[146] So, against her will and by force, she had to finish it.[147] Then she displayed the great piece of weaving that she had woven.[148] She had washed it, and it shone like the sun or the moon. At that time[149] an evil spirit, coming from somewhere, brought back Odysseus[150] to the remote part of his estate, where his swineherd was living.[151] At that time the dear son of godlike Odysseus came over[152] from sandy Pylos, voyaging in his black ship. These two[153] after compacting their plot of a foul death for the suitors,[154] made their way to the glorious town. In fact Odysseus[155] came afterwards; Telemachos led the way, and the swineherd[156] brought in Odysseus, wearing sorry clothing upon him,[157] in the likeness of a wretched vagabond, an old man[158] leaning on a stick, and poor was the clothing he had upon him.[159] Not one of us, even of the older ones, was able[160] to recognize who he was when he appeared so suddenly,[161] but we treated him rudely with evil words and with blows. Odysseus,[162] nevertheless, endured for the time with steadfast spirit[163] to be pelted with missiles and harshly spoken to in his own palace;[164] but then, when the purpose of aegis-bearing Zeus had stirred him,[165] he, with Telemachos, took away the glorious armor,[166] and stowed it away in the chamber, closing the doors upon it.[167] Then, in the craftiness of his mind, he urged his lady[168] to set the bow and the gray iron in front of the suitors,[169] the contest for us ill-fated men, the start of our slaughter.[170] Not one of us was able to hook the string on the powerful[171] bow, but all of us were found far too weak for it;[172] but when the great bow was given into the hands of Odysseus,[173] then all of us spoke out and threatened the man, telling him[174] not to give the bow, however much he might argue.[175] Only Telemachos urged him on and told him to give it.[176] Then much-enduring Odysseus, in his hand accepting it,[177] easily strung the bow, and sent a shaft through the iron.[178] He stood on the threshold, and scattered out the swift shafts before him,[179] glaring terribly, and struck down the king Antinoös.[180] Then he shot his baneful arrows into the others,[181] aiming straight at them, and they dropped one after another.[182] It could be seen then that some one of the gods was helping him,[183] for these men, chasing us through the house in their strength and fury,[184] killed us, one man after another, the floor was smoking[185] with blood, and the horrible cries rose up as our heads were broken.[186] So, Agamemnon, we were destroyed, and still at this moment  p 535  [187] our bodies are lying uncared-for in the halls of Odysseus;[188] for our people in the house of each man know nothing of this,[189] they who would have washed away from our wounds the black blood,[190] and laid us out and mourned us; for this is the right of the perished.”[191] The soul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, answered him:[192] “O fortunate son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices,[193] surely you won yourself a wife endowed with great virtue.[194] How good was proved the heart that is in blameless Penelope,[195] Ikarios’ daughter, and how well she remembered Odysseus,[196] her wedded husband. Thereby the fame of her virtue shall never[197] die away, but the immortals will make for the people[198] of earth a thing of grace in the song for prudent Penelope.[199] Not so did the daughter of Tyndareos fashion her evil[200] deeds, when she killed her wedded lord, and a song of loathing[201] will be hers among men, to make evil the reputation[202] of womankind, even for one whose acts are virtuous.”[203] So these two were conversing each with the other, standing[204] in the gates of Hades, underneath the earth’s secret places.[205] The others went from the city, and presently came to the country[206] place of Laertes, handsomely cultivated. Laertes[207] himself had reclaimed it, after he spent much labor upon it.[208] There was his house, and all around the house ran a shelter,[209] in which the slaves, who worked at his pleasure under compulsion,[210] would take their meals, and sit, and pass the night. There was also[211] an old Sicilian woman there, who duly looked after[212] the old man out on the estate, far away from the city.[213] There Odysseus spoke a word to his son and his servants:[214] “Go now, all of you, inside the strong-fashioned building,[215] and sacrifice the best of all the pigs for our dinner[216] presently; but I myself will make trial of my father,[217] to see whether he will know me and his eyes recognize me,[218] or fail to know me, with all this time that has grown upon me.”[219] So he spoke, and gave his thralls their weapons of warfare,[220] and they went quickly on their way to the house; but Odysseus[221] went closer to the abundant orchard, searching. He did not[222] find either Dolios, as he came into the great orchard,[223] nor any of his thralls, nor his sons, for all these had gone off[224] to gather stones and make them into a wall retaining[225] the orchard, and the old man had guided them on their errand;[226] but he did find his father alone in the well-worked orchard,[227] spading out a plant, and he had a squalid tunic upon him,[228] patched together and ugly, and on his legs he had oxhide[229] gaiters fastened and patched together, to prevent scratching,[230] and gloves on his hands because of the bushes, and he was wearing[231] a cap of goatskin on his head, to increase his misery.[232] Now when much-enduring great Odysseus observed him,[233] with great misery in his heart, and oppressed by old age,[234] he stood underneath a towering pear tree and shed tears for him,[235] and deliberated then in his heart and his spirit[236] whether to embrace his father and kiss him and tell him[237] everything, how he was come again to his own dear country,[238] or question him first about everything, and make trial of him.  p 536  [239] In the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,[240] first to make trial of him and speak in words of mockery.[241] With this in mind, noble Odysseus came straight up to him.[242] He was digging around a plant with his head held downward,[243] and now his glorious son stood near, and spoke to him, saying:[244] “Old sir, there is in you no lack of expertness in tending[245] your orchard; everything is well cared for, and there is never[246] a plant, neither fig tree nor yet grapevine nor olive[247] nor pear tree nor leek bed uncared for in your garden.[248] But I will also tell you this; do not take it as cause for[249] anger. You yourself are ill cared for; together with dismal[250] old age, which is yours, you are squalid and wear foul clothing upon you.[251] It is not for your laziness that your lord does not take care of you,[252] nor is your stature and beauty, as I see it, such as[253] ought to belong to a slave. You look like a man who is royal,[254] and such a one as who, after he has bathed and eaten,[255] should sleep on a soft bed; for such is the right of the elders.[256] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[257] What man’s thrall are you? Whose orchard are you laboring?[258] And tell me this and tell me truly, so that I may know[259] whether this is really Ithaka I have come to, as that man[260] told me just now as I encountered him on my way here:[261] not a very sensible man, for he had no patience[262] to tell me all or listen to what I said, when I asked him[263] about my friend from abroad, whether he still lives and is somewhere[264] here, or is dead now and down in the house of Hades.[265] And I tell you this; listen to me and understand me.[266] Once I entertained a friend in my own dear country,[267] when he came to our house, nor has any man been dearer[268] to me, among all those who have come from afar to my palace.[269] He announced that he was by birth a man of Ithaka,[270] and said that his father was Laertes, son of Arkeisios.[271] I took him into my own house and well entertained him[272] with proper hospitality, since there was abundance[273] in the house, and gave him presents of friendship, as was becoming.[274] I gave him seven talents of well-wrought gold, and I gave him[275] a mixing bowl made all of silver, with flowers wrought on it,[276] and twelve mantles to be worn single, as many blankets,[277] as many handsome cloaks, also the same number of tunics,[278] and aside from these four comely women, whose skill in handiwork[279] was without fault; and he could choose the ones that he wanted.”[280] Then his father, shedding tears, said to him in answer:[281] “Friend, this land that you have reached is the one you were seeking;[282] but violent and reckless men are in control of it,[283] and the grace of those countless gifts you gave is all gone for nothing.[284] If you had found him yet alive in the land of Ithaka,[285] he would have sent you along with gifts in return, and given[286] good entertainment, as is right for him who has given.[287] But come now, tell me this and give me an accurate answer.[288] How many years is it since you entertained that unhappy[289] guest of yours, my son—did he ever live?—an ill-starred[290] man, one whom, far from his country and his own people,  p 537  [291] the fish have eaten in the great sea, or else on the dry land[292] he has been spoil for wild beasts and for birds; and his mother[293] and father, whose child he was, did not give him his rites nor mourn him,[294] nor yet did his bountiful wife, circumspect Penelope,[295] wail for her husband on his bier, as would have been fitting,[296] nor close his eyes; for that is the right of those who have perished.[297] But tell me this too, tell me truly, so that I may know it.[298] What man are you and whence? Where is your city? Your parents?[299] Where is your swift ship standing now, that brought you to this place,[300] and your godlike companions? Or did you come as a passenger[301] in someone else’s ship, and they let you off, and went on?”[302] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[303] “See, I will accurately answer all that you ask me.[304] I am from Alybas, where I live in a famous dwelling,[305] and am the son of Apheidas, son of the lord Polypemon.[306] My own name is Eperitos; now the divinity[307] drove me here on my way against my will, from Sikania.[308] And my ship stands nearby, off the country, away from the city.[309] But as for Odysseus, this is by now the fifth year since[310] he went from there, and took his departure out of my country.[311] Unhappy man. Indeed, the bird signs were good at his going.[312] They were on his right; and I too rejoiced as I sent him[313] off, and he rejoiced as he went. My heart was still hopeful[314] that we would meet in friendship and give glorious presents.”[315] He spoke, and the black cloud of sorrow closed on Laertes.[316] In both hands he caught up the grimy dust and poured it[317] over his face and grizzled head, groaning incessantly.[318] The spirit rose up in Odysseus, and now in his nostrils[319] there was a shock of bitter force as he looked on his father.[320] He sprang to him and embraced and kissed and then said to him:[321] “Father, I am he, the man whom you ask about. I am[322] here, come back in the twentieth year to the land of my father.[323] But stay now from your weeping, shedding of tears, and outcry,[324] for I tell you this straight out; the need for haste is upon us.[325] I have killed the suitors who were in our palace, avenging[326] all their heart-hurting outrage and their evil devisings.”[327] Then in turn Laertes answered him and said to him:[328] “If in truth you are Odysseus, my son, who have come back[329] here, give me some unmistakable sign, so that I can believe you.”[330] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[331] “First, then, look with your eyes upon this scar and know it.[332] The wild boar inflicted it with his white tusk, on Parnassos,[333] when I went there; for you and my queenly mother had sent me[334] to Autolykos, my mother’s dear father, so I could be given[335] those gifts, which he promised me and consented to when he came to us.[336] Or come then, let me tell you of the trees in the well-worked[337] orchard, which you gave me once. I asked you of each one,[338] when I was a child, following you through the garden. We went[339] among the trees, and you named them all and told me what each one[340] was, and you gave me thirteen pear trees, and ten apple trees,[341] and forty fig trees; and so also you named the fifty[342] vines you would give. Each of them bore regularly, for there were  p 538  [343] grapes at every stage upon them, whenever the seasons[344] of Zeus came down from the sky upon them, to make them heavy.”[345] He spoke, and Laertes’ knees and the heart within him went slack,[346] as he recognized the clear proofs that Odysseus had given.[347] He threw his arms around his dear son, and much-enduring[348] great Odysseus held him close, for his spirit was fainting.[349] But when he had got his breath back again, and the spirit gathered[350] into his heart, once more he said to him, answering:[351] “Father Zeus, there are gods indeed upon tall Olympos,[352] if truly the suitors have had to pay for their reckless violence.[353] But now I am terribly afraid in my heart that speedily[354] the men of Ithaka may come against us here, and send out[355] messages everywhere to the Kephallenian cities.”[356] Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:[357] “Never fear, let these concerns not trouble your thinking;[358] but let us go to the house which lies here next to the orchard,[359] for there I sent Telemachos on ahead, with the oxherd[360] and the swineherd, so that they could most quickly prepare our dinner.”[361] So he spoke, and the two went into the handsome dwelling;[362] and when they had come into the well-established dwelling place,[363] there they found Telemachos, and the oxherd and swineherd,[364] cutting up a great deal of meat, and mixing the bright wine.[365] Meanwhile the Sicilian serving maid bathed great-hearted[366] Laertes in his house, and anointed him with olive oil,[367] then threw a handsome mantle about him. Also, Athene,[368] standing by the shepherd of the people, filled his limbs out,[369] and made him taller and thicker to behold than he had been.[370] He stepped forth from the bath, and his son looked on in amazement[371] as he saw him looking like one of the immortal gods to encounter.[372] So he spoke to him and addressed him in winged words, saying:[373] “Father, surely some one of the gods who are everlasting[374] has made you better to look upon for beauty and stature.”[375] Then in turn the thoughtful Laertes said to him in answer:[376] “O father Zeus, Athene and Apollo, if only[377] as I was when, lord of the Kephallenians, I took[378] Nerikos, the strong-founded citadel on the mainland[379] cape; if only I could have been such yesterday in the palace,[380] with armor upon my shoulders, to stand beside you and fight off[381] the suitors’ attack; so I would have unstrung the knees of many[382] there in the hall, and your heart within you would have been gladdened.”[383] Now these two were thus conversing one with the other.[384] And all, when they had finished their work and made ready their dinner,[385] took their places in order on chairs and along the benches.[386] Then they were putting their hands to the dinner, and now there drew near[387] the aged Dolios, and the old man’s sons were with him,[388] coming from their toilsome work, for their mother had called them.[389] This was the old Sicilian woman, who had raised them, and carefully[390] looked after the old man, now that great age had seized him.[391] These, when they saw Odysseus and recognized his identity,[392] stood still in the hall in astonishment; but Odysseus[393] had words of conciliation for them, and so he addressed them:[394] “Sit to dinner with us, old man, and let be your wonder;  p 539  [395] for a long time now we have been eager to put our hands to[396] food, but we waited for you in the halls, ever expecting you.”[397] So he spoke, and Dolios, opening his arms wide, ran straight[398] to him, and took Odysseus’ hand at the wrist, and kissed it,[399] and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words, saying:[400] “Dear master, since you have come back to us, who wanted you[401] but expected you no more—but the very gods have brought you[402] back—we heartily welcome you; may the gods give you blessings.[403] And tell me this and tell me truly, so that I may know it.[404] Does circumspect Penelope know all the truth of this[405] and that you have come back, or shall we send her a messenger?”[406] Then in turn resourceful Odysseus said to him in answer:[407] “She already knows, old man. Why should you trouble to do this?”[408] He spoke, and Dolios sat down again on the polished[409] chair; so too, around great Odysseus, the sons of Dolios[410] came to speak to him in welcome, and shake hands with him,[411] and then went back in order to sit by their father, Dolios.[412] So these were busy in the hall preparing their dinner;[413] but Rumor, a messenger, went swiftly through all the city,[414] crying aloud the terrible death and doom of the suitors;[415] and the people as they heard it came, from their several places,[416] to gather, with groaning and outcry, before the house of Odysseus.[417] They carried the corpses out of the house, and each one buried[418] his own, and sent back all who had come from the other cities,[419] giving them in charge of fishermen to take in their fast ships.[420] They themselves, sorrowful at heart, gathered in assembly.[421] But when they were all assembled and in one place together,[422] Eupeithes stood up and addressed them, since unforgettable[423] sorrow was stored away in his heart for the sake of Antinoös,[424] his son, who was the first to be killed by noble Odysseus.[425] For his sake weeping tears he now stood forth and addressed them:[426] “Friends, this man’s will worked great evil upon the Achaians.[427] First he took many excellent men away in the vessels[428] with him, and lost the hollow ships, and lost all the people,[429] and then returning killed the best men of the Kephallenians.[430] Come then, before he can make his way quickly over to Pylos,[431] or else to shining Elis, where the Epeians are lords, let us[432] go, or else we shall then be shamed forever; all this[433] shall be a disgrace, even for the men hereafter to hear of,[434] if we do not take revenge on the murderers of our brothers[435] and sons; for there would be no pleasure in my heart to go on[436] living, but I would wish to die and be with the perished.[437] So let us go, before they cross the sea, and escape us.”[438] He spoke, weeping, and pity took hold of all the Achaians.[439] But now Medon arrived, and with him the inspired singer,[440] from the palace of Odysseus, since now the sleep had left them;[441] they stood in their midst, and amazement seized upon each man of them.[442] The Medon, full of prudent thoughts, spoke forth and addressed them:[443] “Hear me now, you men of Ithaka; for Odysseus[444] devised what he did, not without the consent of immortal[445] gods. I myself saw an immortal god who was standing[446] beside Odysseus. In every way it resembled Mentor.  p 540  [447] An immortal god was seen, at one time in front of Odysseus[448] urging him on, and then next time he would rout the suitors,[449] and dash about the hall, while they fell one after another.”[450] So he spoke, and the green fear took hold of all of them.[451] Now Halitherses, Mastor’s son, an aged warrior,[452] spoke to them. He alone saw what was before and behind him.[453] Now in kind intention toward all he spoke forth and addressed them:[454] “Hear me now, you men of Ithaka; hear what I tell you.[455] It is by your own weakness, dear friends, that these things have happened.[456] You would not listen to me, nor to Mentor, shepherd of the people,[457] when we told you to make your sons give over their senseless[458] mood; for they, in their evil recklessness, did a great wrong[459] in showing no respect to the wife, despoiling the possessions,[460] of a lordly man. They thought that he never would be coming[461] home. Now let it be thus. Hear me, and do as I tell you.[462] Let us not go there. He who does might incur some evil.”[463] So he spoke, but more than half who were there sprang up[464] with a great cry—though others stayed where they were assembled—[465] since Halitherses’ speech did not please their hearts, but they listened[466] to Eupeithes, and now suddenly they ran for their armor.[467] Now they, when in the shining bronze they had shrouded their bodies,[468] assembled all in a body in front of the spacious city.[469] Eupeithes was their leader in their foolishness. He thought[470] he would avenge the slaughter of his son, but he was not[471] ever to come back, but must himself encounter his death there.[472] Now Athene spoke a word to Zeus, son of Kronos:[473] “Son of Kronos, our father, O lordliest of the mighty,[474] tell me what I ask. What does your mind have hidden within it?[475] Will you first inflict evil fighting upon them, and terrible[476] strife, or will you establish friendship between the two factions?”[477] Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds said to her in answer:[478] “My child, why do you ask and question me in these matters?[479] For was not this your own intention, as you have counseled it,[480] how Odysseus should make his way back, and punish those others?[481] Do as you will; but I will tell you how it is proper.[482] Now that noble Odysseus has punished the suitors, let them[483] make their oaths of faith and friendship, and let him be king[484] always; and let us make them forget the death of their brothers[485] and sons, and let them be friends with each other, as in the time past,[486] and let them have prosperity and peace in abundance.”[487] So he spoke, and stirred on Athene, who was eager before this,[488] and she went in a flash of speed down the pinnacles of Olympos.[489] When the men had put away their desire for delicious feasting,[490] much-enduring great Odysseus began speaking among them:[491] “Let someone go out now and see if they are approaching.”[492] He spoke, and Dolios’ son went out, as Odysseus told him.[493] He went and stood on the threshold and saw them all drawing closer.[494] Now presently he spoke in winged words to Odysseus:[495] “Here they are, coming close to us, so let us arm quickly.”[496] So he spoke, and they sprang up and put on their armor,[497] Odysseus with his three, and the six sons of Dolios;[498] and with them Dolios and Laertes put on their armor,  p 541  [499] gray though they were, but they were fighters perforce. And now,[500] when all of them in shining bronze had shrouded their bodies,[501] they opened the doors, and went outside, and Odysseus led them.[502] But now came their way the daughter of Zeus, Athene,[503] likening herself in appearance and voice to Mentor.[504] Seeing her, much-enduring great Odysseus was happy,[505] and presently he spoke to his dear son, Telemachos:[506] “Telemachos, now yourself being present, where men do battle,[507] and the bravest are singled out from the rest, you must be certain[508] not to shame the blood of your fathers, for we in time past[509] all across the world have surpassed in manhood and valor.”[510] Then the thoughtful Telemachos said to him in answer:[511] “You will see, dear father, if you wish, that as far as my will goes,[512] I will not shame my blood that comes from you, which you speak of.”[513] So he spoke, and Laertes also rejoiced, and said to them:[514] “What day is this for me, dear gods? I am very happy.[515] My son and my son’s son are contending over their courage.”[516] Then standing close beside him gray-eyed Athene said to him:[517] “Son of Arkeisios, far dearest of all my companions,[518] make your prayer to the gray-eyed girl and to Zeus her father,[519] then quickly balance your far-shadowing spear, and throw it.”[520] So Pallas Athene spoke, and breathed into him enormous[521] strength, and, making his prayer then to the daughter of great Zeus,[522] he quickly balanced his far-shadowing spear, and threw it,[523] and struck Eupeithes on the brazen side of his helmet,[524] nor could the helm hold off the spear, but the bronze smashed clean through.[525] He fell, thunderously, and his armor clattered upon him.[526] Odysseus and his glorious son fell upon their front fighters,[527] and began to strike with swords and stab with spears leaf-headed.[528] And now they would have killed them all, and given none of them[529] homecoming, had not Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,[530] cried out in a great voice and held back all the company:[531] “Hold back, men of Ithaka, from the wearisome fighting,[532] so that most soon, and without blood, you can settle everything.”[533] So spoke Athene, and the green fear took hold of them,[534] and in their terror they let fall from their hands their weapons,[535] which fell all on the ground at the cry of the goddess speaking.[536] Striving to save their lives, they turned in flight toward the city.[537] With a terrible cry, much-enduring Odysseus, gathering[538] himself together, made a swoop, like a high-flown eagle.[539] But the son of Kronos then threw down a smoky thunderbolt,[540] which fell in front of the gray-eyed daughter of the great father.[541] Then the gray-eyed goddess Athene said to Odysseus:[542] “Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,[543] hold hard, stop this quarrel in closing combat, for fear[544] Zeus of the wide brows, son of Kronos, may be angry with you.”[545] So spoke Athene, and with happy heart he obeyed her.[546] And pledges for the days to come, sworn to by both sides,[547] were settled by Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,[548] who had likened herself in appearance and voice to Mentor.
